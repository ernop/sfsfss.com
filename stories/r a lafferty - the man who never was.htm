<p><span class=font5><b>THE MAN <i>f\</i></b></span></p>
<p><span class=font6>who tar</span></p>
<p><span class=font5><b>NEVER WAS#C</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font4><b>R. A. LAFFERTY</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font0><b>fn the past two months, R. A. Lafferty has published his first three novels. (Ace Books published two of them, PAST MASTER and SPACE CHANTEY.) He continues his break-neck rush into print with two stories in this year's annual. First, a strange tale of a future kind of man who had some new powers and made a mistake in the way he used them:</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font7>Tm a future kind of man,&quot; Lado said one day. &quot;And I believe there are other men appearing with new powers. The world will have to accept us for what we are.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Bet it don't,&quot; said Runkis.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>This began with Raymond Runkis sniping at Mihai Lado the cattle dealer. &quot;You are a double-decked, seven-stranded, copper-bottomed, four-dimension liar!&quot; Runkis roared out that day.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; Lado said. He was pleased when praised for his specialty. He was the best liar in the neighborhood, and had the most fun out of it. But Runkis didn't let it go at that.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Lado, you never told the truth in your life,&quot; he said loudly.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Tell you what 111 do, Runkis,&quot; Lado said, and his eyes got that double look in them. &quot;You pick any lie IVe ever told, anything IVe ever guyed you about, and I'll make it come true. That's an open offer.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>We began to pay attention then.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;There's a thousand to choose from,&quot; Runkis said. &quot;I <i>could </i>make you produce that educated calf you brag about.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>85</span></p>
<p><span class=font3><b>THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Is that the one you pick? I'll whistle him up in a minute.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;No. Or I could call you on the cow that gives beer, ale, porter and stout each from a separate teat.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;You want her? Nothing easier. But it's only fair to warn you that the porter might be a little too heavy for your taste.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;I could make you bring that horse you have that reads Homer.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Runkis, you're the liar now. I never said he <i>read </i>Homer; I said he <i>recited </i>him. I don't know where that pinto picked it up.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;You said once you could send a man over the edge, make him disappear completely. I pick that one. Do itl&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;I wouldn't want to send a man away; Runkis.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Do it, Lado. You're called. That's one lie you can't make come true. Pick a man and make him disappear. We want to watch.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;All right,&quot; Lado said. &quot;It will take a couple of days, but you can watch all of it. Sure, I'll send a man over the edge.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>This Lado was a funny fellow. He paid for everything in cash and he made up his mind so quick that he scared you. He was the smartest cattle buyer in the Cimarron valley, a big, ruddy, freckled man, but he didn't look like a country boy. He had those crazy eyes that didn't grow around here; he was like one man looking out through the face of another like a mask.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;I've left more than one town and more than one name behind me,&quot; he had told us one day. &quot;I'm a new kind of man with new powers. I don't use them much, but they grow on me. There's a few of us scattered out. We will either have to accommodate, or the world will.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Bet it don't/' said Raymond Runkis.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>Lado put little Mack McGoot to sleep once and sent him around introducing himself to a bunch of cattle as though they were people. And he had once sold Runkis a two-year-old runt for a young calf. A runt will have grown a long tail, but a calf will still have a calf-length tail.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;By hokey, that runt didn't have a long tail when I bought him from you yesterday,&quot; Runkis had said when he realized <i>he </i>was taken.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;He had the same tail,&quot; Lado told him. &quot;You saw what I wanted you to see.&quot; This Lado was tricky, but nobody <i>can </i>send a man over the edge.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;I'll do it,&quot; Lado said this day after he'd thought about it a little. &quot;It'll send Jessie Pidd there over the edge.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>86</span></p>
<p><span class=font0><b>R. A. LAFFERTY</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Who?&quot; Runkis asked.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Jessie Pidd-drinking coffee there at the end of the counter.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Oh. Oh, Jessie. AH right. When will you do it?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;I've started,&quot; said Lado. &quot;I've thinned him out a bit already. You can amuse yourselves by watching him fade. It will be gradual, but in three days he will be gone completely.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>Man! We laughed like a clatter of colts coming onto new clover! But it didn't bother Lado; he always had a deep smile when he was on the long end of a bargain, and he had it now.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>In a way, Lado had a jump on the thing. Jessie Pidd wasn't all there to begin with, though in a different meaning of the words. He was a simpleminded slight man, not much to him. We used to say that he was <i>so </i>thin that he'd disappear if you looked at him sideways, but that was a joke.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>Lado took a lot of harrowing and cross-harrowing as we sat around late that night. We played poker and pitch, and Lado won; we had out the dominoes and played draw and moon, and Lado won. We went with the dice a while, and Lado won. He was the winningest man who ever hit our town, but it looked like there was one deal coming up he couldn't win. But he kept taking bets on the thing; if he did make Jessie Pidd disappear, Lado would own half the town.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>Jessie Pidd looked bad the next morning when he sidled into Cattleman's Cafe for breakfast. He'd always looked bad, though.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Are you all right, Jessie?&quot; Raymond Runkis asked him.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Don't feel all there,&quot; Jessie said. Somehow that startled us.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Lado,&quot; Runkis warned. &quot;Tricks are tricks, and youVe pulled some good ones. But if you really harm the man it will go hard on you around here.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Runkis, you don't even know what constitutes a man,** <i>said </i>Lado.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;No, I <i>don't </i>All I say is you'd better not hurt him.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Nobody will be hurt by any trick of mine,&quot; Lado said.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>But, whatever <i>it </i>was, it had begun.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>At mid-morning, Johnny Noble cried out to the town that Jessie Pidd was walking in the sunlight. and <i>casting </i>no shadow. Two others saw it. Then it clouded over and <b><i>couldn't be tested </i>further.</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font2><b>87</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font3>THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>Just before noon, Maudie Malcome cornered Lado in the bank lobby. &quot;Mr. Lado, what are you doing to my husband?&quot; she demanded.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Have you a husband, Maudie?&quot; Lado asked.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;You red-headed scum! Jessie Pidd, my common-law husband.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Why, Maudie, I am making him disappear.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;If you harm a hair of him, Til kill you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>Later that day the stories were going around town like an epidemic. Even hard-headed Raymond Runkis had to admit that something was wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;I tell you that I can see light shining through Jessie Pidd there,&quot; he declared, &quot;and I can see the outlines of objects behind him. Tell me, Lado, before we come to violence—is this all a trick?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Yes, it is all a trick,&quot; said Lado.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Well, I am hay-baling going to keep this trick within bounds,&quot; Runkis said. &quot;I have the biggest and tightest house in town. The eight of us here for witnesses, and you Jessie, and you Lado, are going there, and we are going to see this thing through. If any of you have any business, attend to it within an hour. Then be at my house. We are going to keep the damnest watch anyone ever kept. Whatever you are, Lado, and whatever you do, we will watch you do it. Am I clear?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;No. You are confused, Runkis, but your plan suits me, What trickster does not love a captive audience?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>We laid in groceries, assembled in the house of Runkis, and locked it tight just at sundown that day. Nobody was allowed to enter for fifty hours, though people did knock and rattle—particularly Maudie Malcome.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>Ten of us: Mihai Lado, Jessie Pidd, Raymond Runkis, Johnny Noble, Will Wilton, Wenchie Hetmonek, Mike McGregor, Billy West, little Mack McGoot, Remberton Randall —one of this bunch (and the way things got legal and sticky later I'm sure not going to say which) being myself.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>Runkis appointed us into watches. We dragged two beds <i>into the </i>big room, and set up two cots. Some of us slept, and some of us played pitch to pass away the night.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>And about once an hour Runkis exploded: <i>^hado, </i>you're killing a man! If he goes, you go too!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;I swear that I do no harm to a person named Jessie Pidd or to any other person,&quot; Lado always said.</span></p>
<p><span class=font3>88</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>R. A. LAFFERTY</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>None of us could longer doubt that Jessie had become faintly transparent. Outlines of objects could be seen through him; his own outline softened. There was less to him than there had been.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>None of us slept much that night. It was a growing horror to watch Jessie go, and by morning you might say that he was half gone.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>The next day was like a crooked dream. Lado had already won all the money in the house. Thereafter, we played for kitchen matches. The cards seemed to change spots and colors in my hands, and the others had the same trouble. Lado also won all the kitchen matches in the house. We watched Jessie fade before our eyes. We lost all sense of time and proportion.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>That night Pidd had become so unsubstantial that smoke drifted through him; there wasn't much left of him but his outline and his slow-witted smile.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>By second morning Pidd was still there, but barely. It was running out in a living nightmare. By noon, little Mack Mc-Goot announced that he could no longer see Jessie. By mid-afternoon, all of us would sometimes lose Jessie Pidd, and it was only with the greatest difficulty that his outline could be picked up again.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>Then we lost him.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>First the outline forever—then the slow-witted smile. By dark, Jessie Pidd was gone. We sat silent and stunned. Then Raymond Runkis broke it with a rumbling sigh: &quot;Lado!&quot; Runkis growled dangerously, &quot;can <i>you </i>still see him?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Never could,&quot; Lado said softiy.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>^WhatT</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;I said that I never could see him,&quot; Lado explained easily.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;You fool! This won't go! Jessie is gone, Lado!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;I know it. It's the best trick I ever pulled.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>Runkis collared Lado savagely. &quot;Bring him back! Bring him back right now, Lado!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;I can't, Runkis. There is nobody to bring back.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;There is—was—Jessie Pidd. Bring him back or I name it murder!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;I believe we should all go to the sheriff,&quot; said Hetmonek. &quot;If this isn't murder, we will find as good a name for it.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>AH of us were witnesses at the hearing. We gave affidavits. Sheriff Bryce was there but out of his depth. There was also a police doctor named Bates from the City, and a Com-</span></p>
<p><span class=font2><b>89</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font3><b>THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font7>missioner named Ottleman from State. This Ottleman was asking the questions, and he had a cutting way of doing it.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Mr. Lado,&quot; he said, &quot;I have heard what is either the most brainless meandering ever given at a hearing, or the most damning testimony it has ever been my displeasure to savor. Are there facts behind this, Lado?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Facts of a sort,&quot; said Lado. &quot;What do you want to know?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Younger brother of a blind moose! What happened to Jessie Pidd?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;He disappeared. They've told you about it.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Can you bring him back?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Oh, I suppose I could, for a little while, but it would spoil the joke.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;You consider the murder of a man a joke, Mr. Lado?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;It isn't a question of murder at all; Jessie Pidd was not a person.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Ah? What was he, then?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;He was nothing at all. There was never any Jessie Pidd.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Lado, you are a red-headed liar,&quot; Runkis growled.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Sure, I'm a liar,&quot; Lado admitted. &quot;That's to say that I'm an illusionist. I have a hundred powers, and I played a little joke with one of them. I can make anything seem to be; I can create reality. I've hidden these things because I don't understand their purpose yet. And one day to lighten the responsibility they cast over me, I decided to have a little fun.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;When was it you first caused us to see Jessie?&quot; Runkis asked tightly.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;The other night when you challenged me to send a man over the edge,&quot; Lado said.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Then how have we known Jessie for years and him doing odd jobs around town?&quot; Runkis asked.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;You hadn't known him, Raymond,&quot; Lado said. &quot;I suggested him to you and you were susceptible. There was never any Jessie Pidd.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Lado, there are difficulties about your explanation,&quot; said Ottleman. &quot;There is testimony that Pidd was indeed known here for years; he was the common-law husband of one—ah —-Maudie Malcome.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;The nearest thing to a husband that Maudie will ever have, it's true,&quot; said Lado. &quot;She is an irrational woman.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;She's no such thing!&quot; swore little Mack McGoot. &quot;She is a poor, simple-minded person, as was Jessie. We liked them. There is going to be vengeance here, either inside or outside the lines.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font3><b>90</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font7>R. A. LAFFERTY</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;I didn't know I was that good,&quot; said Lado. &quot;I turned it on. Why can't I turn it off? Ottleman, these people dream in bunches and build up what never was. Test itl Find me written reference to Pidd antedating these last four days. If a man <i>did </i>live in a town for years, there would have to be some record of him, he would have to live somewhere. If he did odd jobs for years, then someone would have records of payments to his name. We live in a paper world, and somewhere there would be paper on him.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Jessie wasn't such as to be much noted,&quot; said John Noble.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Try it, Ottleman,&quot; insisted Lado. &quot;You will find there is no note anywhere. I also ask that you get separate descriptions of him from these eight witnesses.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;We will recess and try it for two hours,&quot; said Ottleman.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>They assembled a mass of information in two hours.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;The hearing will come to order again,&quot; Ottleman announced. &quot;You haven't a thing to stand on, Lado. There's no doubt of it: Jessie Pidd was well known around town for many years.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;How many years?&quot; asked Lado.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Nobody is quite sure. Estimates run from five to fifty years.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Do the descriptions of this non-man agree?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;All agree in calling him nondescript.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;And what age do they give this nondescript person?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;All speak of him as of an uncertain age. Mr. Lado, I have appraised more evidence than you have. It is normal for people to be vague; it is the usual thing that they do not describe well. But I have no doubt that Jessie Pidd was a real man, and that you have inflicted on him a real death.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Did you find any written note of him? That's the test.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;No, we didn't; and it's no test at all. As they all say, he was not such a man as you would make written note of. Those who hired him paid him in cash. He had never registered <i>to </i>vote, never had a driver's license or social security number, never had a bank account, never been on the tax rolls. He was a man untouched by affairs; he was no part of your paper world.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Did he himself leave anything in writing?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;No. The opinion is that he was an illiterate.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Well cat-haired conniptions! Didn't he even leave an X?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Not even an X, Lado, but he was real for all that. We nay as well close off <i>this </i>diversion of yours and get back to</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>91</span></p>
<p><span class=font3><b>THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font7>the main inquiry. How did you kill him? Where is his body?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Mr. Ottleman, I am speaking clear truth to a room that has no ears for it,&quot; said Lado. &quot;Illusion is one of the gifts that came to me unasked. For the amusement of myself and, I believed, of others, I created an illusion of a man; then I let it fade. There was no Jessie Pidd. He was a simple man only in that I created him by a simple trick. These are all simple men here, Mr. Ottlemen, and they are subject to a continuing illusion.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Have you no remorse for the murder?&quot; asked Ottleman.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Suffering sandburs, you cannot be as obdurate as that! It was a simple trick. Now it is over with, and nobody laughs.&quot; Then Lado spoke more shrilly. &quot;I have the powers by accident. I'm a new kind of man.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;We have an old kind of justice,&quot; said Ottleman. &quot;We will find the body wherever you have hidden it, and you will hang for it.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>But, however much the rope itched for Lado's neck, officialdom could not hang him without a body for evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>Fortunately the private persons of us were not so circumscribed. It had to be done, and we did it.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>It was bright afternoon. Lado didn't want to go; a new kind of man makes just as much fuss about going as the old kind.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;You fools!&quot; Lado shouted with his hands tied behind him. &quot;We are the beginning of something. We're on the line to the future.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;But on the wrong end of the rope today,&quot; Runkis said.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;You fools!&quot; he screamed. &quot;There was never any Jessie Pidd!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>Oh, well—we knew that by now. But, as Lado said once, who wants to spoil a good joke?</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>We hanged him then. Like he said, he arrived in the world a little too early for his own good. He had stopped screaming just before we hoisted him. &quot;I got the powers blind,&quot; he said. &quot;I keep thinking somebody will tell me what to do with them.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;But they don't,&quot; said Raymond Runkis, and we strung him up then.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>Runkis and little Mack McGoot disposed of the body. They said it would never be found where they put it, and it wasn't.</span></p>
<p><span class=font3><b>92</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font1><b>R. A. LAFFERTY</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font7>What do you do when you have just hanged a man? Why, the man himself had showed us what to do. Besides, a future kind of man doesn't leave much of a hole in the present.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>When a whole town sticks together it can do wonders in a few hours. We destroyed every trace of Mihai Lado. We had plenty in our favor. That man with his eternal roll of bills had done everything in cash. We suspected that the name he used wasn't his real name. We went over every business, every person, every deal, every record. A few things had to be smudged, but not many. We had sent him clear over the edge.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>When Ottleman, accompanied by the militia, arrived at dusk, it was a remarkably hard-of-hearing town they had come to.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>Hanged a man? Who? Us? A Mihai Lado? That name sure did not ring any bell in our town. Even our sheriff did not recognize Mr. Ottleman when he came; they had to be introduced all over again. Ottleman set his briefcase down on the ground in exasperation.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>There is some mistake, we said. This is Springdale. You must be looking for Springfield clear in the other part of the State. A previous hearing, you say? And only the day before yesterday? There must be some mistake. And the papers in your briefcase there? I bet that is the case the boy just ran away with. No, we don't know who he was. We don't know who anyone is.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>It was a nervous business, but we played it out all the way and we got clear with it. People, there never was any Jessie Pidd in our town, and there never was any Mihai Lado either.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>There's one thing about those future types, though: we all got to go through that future country.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;He'll be waiting up ahead,&quot; said little Mack McGoot, &quot;one side or the other of the barrier. He'll have us then.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>&quot;Bet he don't,&quot; said Raymond Runkis, but Runkis had begun to go to pieces. He began to get old all at once, and old is one thing I don't want to get. I sure drag my feet on it.</span></p>
<p><span class=font7>Up ahead, around some dark corner, one side or the other of the barrier as little Mack McGoot says, there's a big ruddy freckled man who has some powers that will be beginning to get ripe. He's a man with crazy eyes that didn't grow around here, and he's like one man looking out through the face of another <i>like </i>a mask.</span></p>
