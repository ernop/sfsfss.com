Oliver Murex was his finding of a seashell when he was four years old. It was a
bright and shining shell that the dull little boy found. It was bigger than his
own head (and little Oliver had an unusually large head), and had two eyes
peering out of its mantle cavity that were brighter and more
intelligent-seeming than Oliver’s own. Both. Oliver and the shell had these
deep, black, shiny eyes that were either mockingly lively or completely dead - with
such shiny, black things it was hard to say which.</span></p>

been looking for bright shells, going in a close skirmish line over that sand

the years of his growing up. He listened often to the distant sounding in it,
as people have always listened to seashells. No cone, however, is a real
ocean-roarer of a shell. They haven’t the far crash; they haven’t the boom.
They just are not shaped for it, not like a Conch, not like a Vase Shell, not
like a Scallop, not even like the common Cowries or Clam Shells or Helmet
Shells. Cones make rather intermittent, sharp sounds, not really distant. They
tick rather than roar.</span></p>

depended on it. If he was asked a question he would first hold the big cone
shell to his ear and listen - then he would answer the question intelligently.
But if for any reason he did not have his shell near at hand he seemed
incapable of an intelligent answer on any subject.</span></p>

has digested them they will come through to the outside again where they can be

believed this was an Alphabet Cone. It wasn’t. It was a deadly Geography Cone.
The little blotches that seemed to fall off it or to come out of it and run
around - and that then had to be swallowed again - may have been little
continents or seas coming from the Geography Cone; they may have been quite a
number of different things. But if they were alphabets (well, they <i>were </i>those,
among other things), then they were more highly complex alphabets than Helen
suspected.</span></p>

that all children in a family be smart. Six smart ones out of seven isn’t bad.

examination. ‘What he has is two concentric personalities. We call them the
core personality and the mantle personality - and there is a separation between
them. The mantle or outer personality is dull in Oliver’s case. The core
personality is bright enough, but it is able to contact the outer world only by
means of some separate object. I believe that the unconscious of Oliver is now
located in this object and his intelligence is tied to it. That seashell there,
now, is quite well balanced mentally. It’s too bad that it isn’t a boy. Do you
have any idea what object it is that Oliver is so attached to?’</span></p>

because cone shells are so much bigger on the inside than on the outside. They
would put half a dozen cone shells into an amphora of wine to temper them for
it. Then they would take them out and pour one, two, or three amphoras of wine
into each cone shell. The cones have so many internal passages that there is no
limit to their capacity. The Greeks would load ships with the wine-filled cones
and ship them all over the world. By using cones, they could ship three times
as much wine as otherwise in the same ship.’</span></p>

the Murex family, some of them overlapping. The two tycoons were making
non-conflict territory agreements and the visitor was out-shuffling the whole
Murex clan by a little bit in these complex arrangements.</span></p>

clean them off there!’ Mrs Murex said once where she saw a splatter of small
blotches and dust motes on the table that served both for conference and dinner
table - the splatter of little things was mostly about the visitor.</span></p>

them,’ that person said. ‘I enjoy their conversation. Really, they could almost
be Notarii from my own world.’ Things began then to go well in these
transactions even for the Murex family, just when they had seemed to be going
poorly.</span></p>

handsome in an off-worldly way. He was toothless, but his bony upper and lower
beak cut through everything, through the prime steak that seemed too tough to
the Murex clan, through the bones, through the plates. ‘Glazed, baked clay, we
use it too. It spices a meal,’ the visitor said of the plates as he munched
them. ‘And you have designs and colours on the pieces. We do that sometimes
with cookies.’</span></p>

stenographer there, however much it may remind you of the stenographers where
you come from.’ Mr Murex tried to set a matter straight again. ‘That is what we
call a seashell.’</span></p>
