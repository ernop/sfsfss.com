<p class=Para09><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=Para09><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=Para01><span lang=EN>This is my attempt at translating a light novel
from Japan, only the original source material doesn't exist.</span></p>

<p class=Para01><span lang=EN>The light novel is a Japanese custom which aims
at easy reading.  I think of it as an art form in which only the story's bones
remain.</span></p>

<p class=Para01><span lang=EN>If you want to read a translation of a Japanese
light novel, I liked “Evil God Average” (Jashin Average) as translated by the
Fifth Holy Sheeprabbit.  That might help you to appreciate this story, since it
conveys the genre to which this story belongs.</span></p>

<p class=Para01><span lang=EN>For those of you who haven't read any light
novels before:</span></p>

<p class=Para01><span lang=EN>A remarkable portion of light novels are about
people being transported from one world to another.  Japan has easier ideas
about copyright, so their literary system more often contains many works on the
same theme.</span></p>

<p class=Para01><span lang=EN>That theme began with heroes from our world being
transported to another world to fight the Demon Lord.</span></p>

<p class=Para01><span lang=EN>Now there are light novels about the Demon Lord
dying, being reincarnated in our world as a high-schooler, and then being
transported to another world as one of the adversarial side characters in a
romantic video game.  Or the hero is a man from our world, reincarnated as an elven
girl, who has already become an absurdly powerful adventurer, but now works
incognito as a receptionist.  I'm not joking.</span></p>

<p class=Para01><span lang=EN>Light novels also have a unique writing style I'm
trying to imitate, including this easy style of author's notes.  I don't think
I do it well (laughs).  Maybe I'll improve?</span></p>

<p class=Para01><span lang=EN>This story was supposed to be completely silly. 
Please keep that in mind.  I failed at that by the end of the second chapter,
but still, that's the origin.</span></p>

<p class=Para01><span lang=EN>The main character doesn't always agree with the
author about decision theory.  It'd be silly to think we'd agree about things
that are less objective. </span></p>

<p class=Para10><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=Para10><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>My family name is Yugano.  My given name is
Yuuki.  I have no redeeming qualities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The boys I meet fail to interest me, and I
haven't kissed any of them.  This is because the Internet has ruined my way of
looking at the world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>In the beginning, seeing pics of a muscular
man with no shirt was enough to make me breathe faster.  If I came across a
picture of a man being nude, I would flinch away in horror.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Over time, I moved on to pictures of nude men,
then two men doing things to one another.  As I became numb to one perversion,
I had to find something more extreme to arouse my interest.  Now I have no
interest in normal forms of youthful misbehavior.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>You say I should have refrained?  Back then I
was too young to know better, and now this untouched maiden has been so
thoroughly ruined that I might as well go further.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I blame the government and my parents.  In the
very beginning, they should have stopped that innocent girl from seeing
perverted things online.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Now I spend hours every day browsing the
Internet, doing you-know-what to myself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>At this point I'd like to deliver a sharp
remark about how stories depict being transported to another world.  You know
the scene I'm talking about: the Hero arrives surrounded by holy clerics
casting the Summoning Spell, with well-dressed royalty and future adventuring
companions looking on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>In every one of those cases, the Summoning
catches the Hero at a time when the Hero is standing up and fully dressed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Is this realistic?  Would a Hero be Summoned
only at such a convenient time?  I bet you spend much of your day sitting
down.  If the Summoning caught you then, wouldn't you materialize unsupported,
and fall on your ass?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Imagine being a Hero being transported while
they're on the toilet.  They materialize in a sitting position with their
underwear around their ankles, then fall over with their knees still bent and
pants down.  Their butt hasn't been wiped, and it leaves a smear on the
ground.  Maybe the Summoned Hero is right in the middle of pooping out a big
one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>What happened to me was <span class=0Text>even
more embarrassing</span> than that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>It involved my usual Internet habits.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>That was the first step of my journey into
another world.</span></p>

<p class=Para10><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=Para10><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The cold was my first startling observation. 
A chill wind bit into my exposed thighs and unmentionables like… like a very
cold knife.  I'm sorry, I'm distracted right now and can't think up a clever
metaphor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The next thing my eyes saw was the other
people staring at my vulnerable body.  There were five adults in white robes
holding up their staves, silver halos glowing above their heads.  Beyond them,
a dirty old man in leather and chains - no, I mean leather armor and chainmail,
don't misunderstand me, and when I say 'dirty' I mean that he had stains on his
armor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Next to the old warrior, a young lad my age
with a sword belted at his side, with a clean and finely made shirt.  He was
looking away from me and wringing his hands like an eight-year-old girl who
just saw a crayon drawing of private parts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Around me, a circle of huge standing stones.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Beyond that, walls of grass, the slopes of
rising hills.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>And below me, a circular stone plate inscribed
with curves in a fading silver glow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Immediately after I arrived, there was a lot
of shrieking… you know, let's not talk about this.  I'm choosing to repress
these memories for the rest of my life.  Let's skip to the part where somebody
has given me a towel-like cloth to hold around myself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>So there I am, standing, wrapped in a towel;
aside from that my surroundings are as previously specified.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I have many issues with this.  I am setting
aside my issues and listening to the words of the white-robed mage with the
brightest halo.   I think this part might be important.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Yugano Yuuki,” the white mage intones, “you
have been Summoned here to overturn the greatest evil of this world, the Wicked
Emperor.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The old warrior in chain-mail speaks up.  “How
is this girl supposed to do that, exactly?  Is there more to her than is
apparent?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“I have similar questions,” I say.  I'd better
have arrived here with some incredible cheat-like advantage, or this world is
amazingly doomed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“That's impossible for me to know, but she is
certainly the Summoned Hero,” says the mage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Could there have been an error in the
Summoning Spell?” asks chainmail-wearer.  “And if so, is it too late to send
her back and get another one?” He looks back at me.  “No offense, but it's for
the sake of everyone.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>None taken.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The white mage casts a glance in my
direction.  “The Spell can only be worked once every three hundred years, in a
certain place.  But this Great Summoning Spell we have just cast should,
without fail, have selected the Hero with the best chance to overturn the
Wicked Emperor who has cruelly subjugated half the world.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>That's some convenient exposition, but I'll
excuse it since you're stating it for my sake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Maybe our best chance of defeating the Wicked
Emperor still isn't good?”  Again warrior-guy echoes my own thoughts.  “Even
leaving aside the condition in which she arrived, I would expect the most
skilled person to be older, or in the prime of their adulthood.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The white-clad mages glance at one another,
looking concerned.  “There's a divination that's itself part of the Summoning
Spell,” says another mage, a woman.  “To state it clearly, if the Summoned Hero
is the person with the greatest probability of defeating the Wicked Emperor,
then the Spell itself must determine that probability.  Traditionally the
probability isn't observed since then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy,
but in this case…”  The white mage grimaces.  “She doesn't seem like the Hero
we were expecting.  I agree we ought to check what the Spell determined as her
probability of victory.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The chainmail-man frowns.  “Why wouldn't you
always check the probability?  Is it dangerous to do so?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Another white-robed mage speaks up.  “Imagine
that someone has a ninety percent chance of defeating the Wicked Emperor if
they aren't told anything.  Then they're told they have a ninety percent
probability of winning.  They might feel relieved of the need to make a desperate
effort, so their true probability of winning would become much lower.  Since
the probability has to be consistent, that can't happen.  On the other hand,
suppose we're told our chance of winning is only two percent.  Then, feeling
already defeated, our chances of victory might drop that far.  Given those two
possible answers, since the probability must be consistent, the observed
probability would be two percent.  So it's best to decide in advance not to
peek at the probability that the Spell predicts… still, this case does seem
like an exception.  Just be sure to keep the number to yourselves, and try not
to let it affect your decisions.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The prince-boy and the old man both look
puzzled.  As for me, since I come from Earth where there are time travel movies,
I've followed the reasoning without difficulty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The five white mages begin chanting.  Staves
are raised, the golden halos above their heads grow brighter.  I suppose I
should be more impressed, but it's really not much in the way of special
effects.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The mages lower their staves.  Most of them
look rather surprised.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Her chance of overthrowing the Wicked Emperor
is… one hundred percent?!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Eh?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>You say that's my probability of winning even
after being told my probability of winning?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Then I might as well slack off and do what I
want, huh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>It may be an awful thing to say with the fate
of the world at stake.  But realistically, if I'm the sort of person who'll be
lazy given half a chance, there's no point in trying my best as a Summoned Hero
if I'm going to win even after taking into account the changes in my behavior
caused by knowing that I'm going to win.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I wonder what amazing cheat-like ability I'll
discover, and whether it can be abused for other purposes besides overthrowing
the Wicked Emperor?</span></p>

<p class=Para10><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Magic powers, magic powers, I'm going to get
my magic po~wers!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I don't mind telling you that there was a
spring in my step as I went skipping toward the next ceremony that had already
been prepared for me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>While I haven't resolved my numerous issues, I
do like how everything is so straightforward here.  Compared with other tales
I've read of being summoned to another world, I'm glad I didn't wind up with a
harder case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>…I hope I didn't just curse myself by thinking
that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>By the way, I seem to be in a rebel encampment
that's hidden between several hills and therefore not visible from a distance. 
At least, this is what I infer from watching people polishing their weapons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Soon I come upon yet another group of mages,
gold-robed people that seem to be mostly younger women.  The halos over their
heads are only faintly visible.  Chainmail-guy, noble-boy, and one of those
archmage types are following behind me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Before me is a stone plate with inscribed
lines that look much less elaborate than the circle I arrived in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“It's important that you understand the
purpose of this ceremony,” says one of the women in gold robes.  She casts a
doubtful look at my towel-clothing and the nubile body I'm keeping underneath
it.  “They say to assume a Summoned Hero doesn't know anything, so should I
start with the very basics?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I dislike rhetorical questions, so whenever I
hear one I always give the less expected answer.  “No, you should skip straight
to the most advanced part without any preliminaries.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Well, the very basics are as follows,” says
the gold-robe mage.  “The magic of the world is divided into Evil magic aligned
with Demons and Good magic aligned with Angels.  In the same way that those who
now rule the world wield power based on wickedness, the holy magic of this
Rebellion comes from goodness.  A good mage derives her power from contracting
with an Angelic being, which agrees to lend you power in exchange for you
committing yourself to purity.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Well, that explains the halos - ah, ah, let's
hold on for a minute or possibly several weeks.  “Just what do you mean by
purity?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>She looks puzzled.  “I mean behavior that is
holy and good as opposed to unholy and not good.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“As a Summoned Hero from another world, it's
impossible for me to know whether I understood what you meant by that.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“I don't understand what you mean by saying
that you don't understand what I mean.  Even if the people in your world are
more wicked than the people in this one, they should still know what
righteousness is.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>My philosophy textbook had a clear idea of
what righteousness is: namely, righteousness is explicitly stating your
definitions.  “If I follow a course to overthrowing the Wicked Emperor for the
benefit of all peoples in this world, harm nobody who doesn't harm anyone else,
and otherwise do what I want, is that sufficient?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Of course not!  You can't just do what you
want!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Another gold-robed woman speaks.  “To begin
with the elementary fundamentals of the basics, to form a contract you must be
a virgin.  Then, it goes without saying that sullying yourself with a man would
cause your Angel to flee from you.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I look at the archmage.  He's seen how I was
when I arrived here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“You <span class=0Text>are</span> still untouched
by men, aren't you?”  The archmage speaks gently, but with a worried
countenance.  “Even if you've done certain sinful things that you mustn't do
again?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“I haven't so much as kissed a boy.  However,
I am worried that my thoughts may be so sinful that an Angel won't want to
contract with me.”  Honestly I'm worried that my Angel will burst into flames…
no, it will explode.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Several of the women clear up at this, like
they finally understand what's happening.  “Oh, that's nothing to worry about,
dear sister!” says the one who spoke first.  “It means more for a poor farmer
to pass up a temptation of ten silver than for a rich official to pass up a
bribe of a hundred gold.  So long as you <span class=0Text>do</span> nothing
wrong, being more tempted by sin makes it a holier deed to commit yourself to
purity… ah, I see you're smiling now that you realize the Angelic Powers are
forgiving.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Of course that's why I'm smiling.  There's no
other reason at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The more corrupt thoughts you start with, the
more power you gain from promising to be pure, is what I think I heard you say?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>There's one thing I'd better check, though. 
“It's okay for a white mage to retire, isn't it?  There's no penalty if you
decide afterward to tell your angel to go away, so you can settle down with a
nice husband and make some children?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The maidens are blushing.  “Of - of course
not!  Even though that's not quite, quite…”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>One hundred percent chance of victory, here I
co~me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Though I am a little worried.  I've never gone
more than a day or two without giving myself release.  Even when I tried to
deny myself for perverted reasons, my willpower failed.  I hope that I can
clear up this Wicked Emperor matter in a month, and not go insane with
repressed desires before then.</span></p>

<p class=Para08><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The ceremony for obtaining my ma~gic po~wers
is simple.  The gold-robed women are holding their hands and singing a short
melody, and the stone seal is glowing silver like the colors of their halos.  I
think someone from this world would find this very holy and uplifting, but I've
heard electronic-orchestral chorales with better singing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>My Angel appears in a burst of light and… oh,
this isn't fair.  The Angel is male, and his robes are clinging to his form,
which is thin and fair.  The beautiful face above is one of supreme innocence. 
Even for someone who's seen many Internet pictures, encountering a true Angel
is a moving experience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>This Angel… this Angel is just begging for
someone to corrupt him and do unspeakable things to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Normally women fear what men might do to them,
which is the reason I refrained from fulfilling my awful desires back when they
were still in the realm of possibility.  But if this Angel is really a creature
of purity, then it follows that he wouldn't do anything bad to me.  In other
words, he'd be defenseless before me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>But if I do tha~at, he'll run away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The archmage is whispering in my ear and I'm
repeating the words of the ancient contract.  Hey Angel-butt, I'll refrain from
my naughty desires if you grant me supreme magical power to stomp the Wicked
Emperor, yo?  This bargain is needlessly lengthy for accomplishing that much.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Angel speaks his own lines and his dulcet,
young, boyish tones make my insides twitch.  Knowing I'm not allowed to do
a-ny-thing about that, even to myself, makes my insides twitch more.  This is
going to be a long month for me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The white light of the seal fades, and now a
cute little version of my Angel is hovering over my shoulder where only I can
see him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Listen well to the counsel of your Angel,”
the archmage says gravely.  “The righteous action is not always what we must do
to save our people.  But while your Angel is with you, you will always know the
difference and what you are sacrificing when you choose otherwise.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>My Angel's eyes are wide and he's waving his
hands frantically and making a high-pitched EEEEEEEE sound, but he hasn't
actually burst into flames so I'll call this contract a success.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>People are running around shrieking things

this camp and they outnumber us by three hundred million billion trillion to
one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Hey, idiot with the white robes and long
staff, is it the usual practice that the Hero is Summoned to overthrow the
current greatest evil?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Is it true that the Great Summoning can only
be performed <span class=0Text>at this time, in this place, </span>within the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>DIDN'T YOU IMAGINE THE WICKED EMPEROR MIGHT DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THAAAT-T-T!?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>This is definitely a punishment from the
vengeful gods because I let myself look forward to easy times.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Summoned Hero!” cries the old warrior with
the chainmail that's been following me around.  “Yugano Yuuki!  What must we
do?  How can we survive?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>My mind races rapidly and I seize on the first
answer that comes to mind.  “Quick, grab all the pairs of underpants you can
and wear them over your heads!  Then, attack the Enemy with watermelons!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>People stare at me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Maybe answering with the very first thing that
came to mind was a bit much, but—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“I have a one hundred percent probability of
overturning the Wicked Emperor,” I point out.  “It's not that every possible
choice we <span class=0Text>could</span> make, would lead to victory.  But
whatever I end up deciding to <span class=0Text>actually</span> do, that
particular course of action has a one hundred percent chance of victory.  So if
we actually attack with watermelons, we'll definitely win!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The old warrior clutches at his head. 
“Leaving aside all my other objections, we don't even have any watermelons!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>What?  This is disastrous!  I can't think of
any different plans!  Or rather, all my other plans involve having not gotten
into this situation in the first place!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“We're doomed!” shrieks a white mage running
past.  A second later, he's running past again in the opposite direction. 
“Doomed, I tell you, doomed!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The old man pulls himself together, a grimness
settling over him.  “The absolute goal is to allow you to escape, the Summoned
Hero who will certainly succeed.  Even if I and all this camp must sacrifice
ourselves to break out of this encirclement, it's all right so long as you go
free.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>H-hey!  What are you saying?  Should so many
people die to save me, a girl with no redeeming qualities?  I'd never sleep
again!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“I'll make you up a pack with weapons,” the
old man is saying.  “Trust nobody, for the Wicked Emperor will seed this area
with spies.  Live off the forest, even if you eat seeds and berries for years,
it's wiser than appearing before a human being.  Live, and in time, be the
certain instrument of our vengeance!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I already had my doubts about this course of
action, but that settles it.  Anything that involves living without toilet
paper is not a realistic option for me.  Besides, although I'm new to my Angel,
there's no doubt I will be an overpowered character.  “I have a better idea. 
I'm the girl with a one hundred percent chance of victory, so let's reverse
your strategy.  Why don't I hold off the Wicked Emperor's armies, while the
rest of you make your escape?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The old man is speechless at my brilliance. 
His mouth opens and shuts several times.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Angel on my shoulder is nodding
approvingly.  Yes, this noble act of mine must be a righteous deed by local
standards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Listen,” I say, “if I know I have a one
hundred percent chance of success regardless, I won't choose a course where
people die for me along the way.”  Who knows, maybe I can close out this quest
in just one day.  If there's a novel with me as an overpowered heroine, that's
definitely how it should go!</span></p>

<p class=Para08><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>And tha~at's how I found myself on a hill
gazing down sternly at the Wicked Emperor's military forces.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Ha, these thousands of cavalry on their
shining horses, the countless bowmen glowering at me, and foot soldiers
stretching over the hills and out of sight—you don't impress me.  I've seen
pictures of real armies!  With guns, and helicopters, and tanks on aircraft
carriers!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Seeing that your enemy has fielded a single
girl standing alone on this hill, are the looks on your faces fearful?  Of
course not!  Bewildered contempt is more like it!  But soon, those looks will
change!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Oh dear, what's this?  I seem to have acquired
a straggler.  Are you under the impression you've joined my party without my
say-so?  That's very forward of you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“I won't let you stand alone!”  The
noble-looking boy says that, holding his sword aloft and, yes, it's flashing in
the sun.</span></p>

<p class=Para03><span class=0Text><span lang=EN style='font-style:normal'>Are
you under the impression this is cool?  Aragorn-sama from the </span></span><span
lang=EN>Lord of the Rings</span><span class=0Text><span lang=EN
style='font-style:normal'> movies is cool when he does this.  You're just a
kid.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“My name is Teragon Omoia, and I'll be with
you to the end, Yugano Yuuki.”  He's trembling, but still manages to smile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I can't let myself be outdone by this
upstaging interloper.  With a breezy gesture, I flip my hair behind me so that
the wind can blow around my glossy strands.  “Oi, oi, what's this about
endings?  I am Summoned Hero Yuuki, the overpowered character with a one
hundred percent chance of success!  I'll definitely win this day!  Because the
sheer perversion of the desires I'm repressing to be pure, is something that
nobody from this world can possibly beat!  I'll show you the power of a girl
that's been corrupted by the Internet!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The boy is looking even more nervous than he
was before.  I point at the army before me with a commanding gesture, and toss
my head so my hair will blow nobly in the wind some more.  “My Angel!  This is
my command under our compact of purity!  Knock them all unconscious, but don't
kill them!”  I cup my hands together to emit a mighty energy blast.  “ETERNAL…
RAINBOW… SHIMMERING… LASER… THUNDER…”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>…anyway, that's how I ended up tightly bound
on a cart heading back to the Wicked Empire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=Para10><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=Para10><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>It's time to face up to some uncomfortable
possibilities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>One possibility is that since the Wicked
Empire already had our camp surrounded from the beginning, there was no Hero
anywhere who could overcome that disadvantage, and the Summoning Spell was
doing the equivalent of dividing by zero.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Or since no Hero had any chance of success,
the Summoning Spell kept searching until it happened upon a weird girl that
broke its evaluation system and wrongly registered a 100% probability of
victory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>But on the other hand, I'm still alive!  Even
if I turned out not to be a sufficiently overpowered character and was
shamefully captured after knocking only eight knights off their horses!  I'm on
my way to the Empire, and a sudden reversal of fortunes leading up to my
predestined success is a definite possibility!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I wish the person who tied me up had been more
experienced in shibari and had tied me in more interesting knots, so long as
I'm forced to live through this part.  The feel of real rope against my skin is
different from just seeing pictures of it.  I want to struggle and acquaint
myself with the sensation, but these boring knots are looped only around my
hands and feet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>There's a paper strip stuck firmly to my
forehead, applied by a sick-looking woman dressed in black.  When she did that
to me, the same seal appeared over my Angel's mouth as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>It's sunset before anyone gets around to
feeding me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I try to look grateful for my plate of food. 
It contains meat, which is probably a luxury in this primitive world.  The
bread looks freshly baked and without bugs in it.  The cheese is only slightly
stale.  I believe they must be trying to feed me well for army rations… but, comparing
this to the cuisine of Earth is pointless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I've held out well up until this point, but
the thought of never again eating dark chocolates with a vanilla caramel center
causes a single tear to run down my cheek.  Complex sweets are probably as far
beyond this world's technology level as carbon steel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Empire soldier who's feeding me sees my
tearful cheek, and smiles darkly.  Do you have that interest, soldier-san?  I
remember my 'pictures of crying boys' phase… oh, I was so much more innocent
then.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Thanks for feeding me, soldier-san.”  I let a
quaver into my voice.  “What's going to happen to me after this?  Hey,
soldier-san, would you tell me what happens after this?”  This young maiden
might cry mo~re if you tell her!  Would you like to see my cheeks wetted with
more tears, soldier-san?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The soldier chuckles evilly.  You're easy that
way, aren't you, soldier-san.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“The Wicked Vizier,” the soldier says, each
word spoken with slow relish, “has ordered the Summoned Hero and all her
companions brought before him, alive and mostly unhurt.”  He pauses.  “I expect
you'll be violated by him to rid you of your Angel… and then, sacrificed to a
Demon.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Hm.  I let a stammer into my voice.  “W-what
does being sacrificed to a Demon entail p-precisely?  Can you be more
s-specific?”  I blink my eyes repeatedly, as though I'm about to burst into
tears.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“You become the Demon's plaything and it
humiliates you in unimaginably horrific ways.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“T-thank you for telling me, soldier-san.”  I
make myself swallow hard.  “Do the Demons have t-t-tentacles?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The soldier stares blankly at me.  “What?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“It would be really s-scary if the Demons had
slimy tentacles and they used them to p-p-penetrate my -”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The soldier's face goes red.  He makes a
strangled sound and bolts from my cart, leaving my plate of food behind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>This world… really is a very innocent place,
isn't it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Great, now my Angel is emitting that

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>It's a gloomy day when my cart rolls into the
capital city of the Wicked Empire, which is dirty, covered in horse manure, and
essentially uninhabited compared to Tokyo.  The Wicked Palace is set with
crystal and gold that makes it gleam in the sun, but the pictures I've seen of
the Taj Mahal have it beat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>As we approach the palace, the unbearable odor
goes away, and I can once more smell myself thinking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Am I truly going to be violated?  Is today the
day my virginity will be torn away from me?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I want to be excited by the thought, but a
part of me is muttering realistic thoughts about it being painful, unexciting,
and probably a lifelong trauma.  Shut up, part of me.  Thinking that way is
probably increasing the chance that I'll be traumatized.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Maybe the Wicked Vizier will be enchanted by
this beautiful yet impure virgin.  Maybe he's the only one here who's twisted
enough to suit me.  We'll fall in lo~ve and do all sorts of perverse things to
each other, and together we'll overthrow the Wicked Emperor with one hundred
percent probability!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>…I wouldn't mind that, actually?  It's not how
I thought my week would go, but I am essentially okay with this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>All right, certain victory, here I come!  Try
number two!  Yosh!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Quit shrieking in that tinny voice, you
useless Angel.  My husband and I will be wise and benevolent co-rulers, I'm
sure.  This is for everyone's good.</span></p>

<p class=Para08><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I'm being bathed before I see the Wicked
Vizier!  This is a good sign which implies he may be attracted to my nubile
body.  I'm relieved that things are going just as planned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The bath is the size of a large living room,
with lukewarm, vaguely lemon-scented water.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The bath attendants are catgirl maidens. 
Their ears are cute, and the bodies beneath them are feminine and well-curved. 
But they're nearly nude for the bath, instead of wearing maid uniforms.  They
don't even have slave shackles on their wrists and ankles.  Also no collar or
bell, but then I think that element is somewhat worn by now.  I would rate
these catgirl maidens at 4 of 10.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Having someone else to wash my hair is nice,
though.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN> After I'm dried off, my plan to entice the
Wicked Vizier hits a roadblock.  There's no way for me to dress seductively!  I
can select from many sets of clothing, but all of them are similar.  I can wear
anything I want, so long as I want a floor-length white dress with long sleeves
and a neckline so high it's a chin-line.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Does the Wicked Vizier only want to do
perverse things to girls who appear pure?  That would be a devastating
setback!  If he doesn't enjoy even a hint of naughtiness, I'm done for!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I consider demanding to wear only the panties
and under-slip for the outfit, but these panties are something my grandmother
would wear, and besides, I might lose my nerve.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>In the end I just leave out the panties, like
in that phase I went through a few years back.  It's the physical proof I'll
provide for having an impure mind.</span></p>

<p class=Para08><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>This food is acceptable.</span></p>

<p class=Para08><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I'm brought into a small, windowless office
and chained to a massive chair facing a small throne.  The chair itself is
comfortable, but someone in this world needs to invent fur-lined handcuffs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>After checking my security, the guards depart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Wicked Vizier doesn't have a pointed beard
to stroke, and his hair is greying.  His bushy eyebrows and generally thin look
don't make up that critical deficit.  I will allow this person to pass as an
evil counselor, but only barely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“I trust your reception here has been to your
liking?”  The Wicked Vizier says this in a voice that is low and ominous, so my
rating of him goes up by one point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Meh, it was adequate.  I appreciated the
bath.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Good, good.”  The Wicked Vizier smiles. 
“Your noble companion, calling himself Taragon of Omoia, is in fine health as
well.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>There's a pause.  I'm waiting for the Wicked
Vizier to ominously say 'for now', but he doesn't.  “Well, thanks,” I reply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Yugano Yuuki - that is your name, correct?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I nod.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Tell me, Yugano Yuuki, why do you think I
commanded you to be brought here?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“You're going to violate me and then sacrifice
me to a Demon.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Wicked Vizier's eyebrows go up.  “This
prospect doesn't seem to alarm you.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Although it's possible the Great Summoning
Spell was mistaken, it's also possible that it wasn't.  It would be naive to
despair entirely after being told that I have a one hundred percent chance of
victory.  So I'm focusing on that hope; there's no reason to spend much time
considering the alternative.  “Mm,” I say, “I was hoping that I could seduce
you.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Wicked Vizier coughs.  “That's… quite
straightforward of you.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Either I have a one hundred percent chance of
succeeding or I don't.  Thus, there's no point beating around the bush.   “A
young maiden like me has no chance of concealing her intentions from you who
must be steeped in deception, cruelty, and fascinating perversions.”  I smile
winsomely at him.  I want to also lean forward and show off my cleavage, but
this stupid dress won't allow it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Wicked Vizier is keeping a neutral face. 
“What if it happens that you're not my type?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“I'll have no choice but to seduce the Demon
you sacrifice me to.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>A coughing sound comes from the Wicked
Vizier.  He clears his throat, then says, “I perceive that you are filled with
great hope and dynamism.  This is an admirable quality in a youth.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Thanks, future husband-sama!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Correct me if I'm mistaken, but doesn't that
Angel-sealing paper strip on your forehead imply that you formed an Angelic
contract?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Well, but I'm not a virgin because I have a
pure mind.  Rather, I'm a virgin because my desires are so twisted and perverse
that ordinary misbehavior doesn't appeal to me.”  I smile at him and wiggle my
eyebrows.  “Does that kind of girl appeal to you?  By the way, underneath this
dress you gave me, I'm not wearing any pa~nties.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Wicked Vizier's eyes drop lower before he
wrenches them back up to meet my smiling gaze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Do you want to che~ck?  Undoing my chains
first is unnecessary, I'm into that too.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Wicked Vizier takes a breath.  “Yugano
Yuuki, I appreciate that you're an inexperienced woman trying to entice a man
in order to save her life.  But for future consideration, you should remember
that there's a difference between seducing someone, and being as lewd as
possible in their direction.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Hm.  “We might be dealing with a conflict of
cultural assumptions.  Where I come from, every man has one desire so horrible
that he can't believe any girl would go along with it, and the key to seduction
is hinting that you might be open to having it done to you.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Just what kind of world did you inhabit
before you came here?!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I take a deep breath and straighten my back,
because the pride of Earth demands that my words do it justice.  “Thicker than
the air I breathed, I was surrounded by the Internet, the greatest creation of
my race!  A device of pure thought larger than countries, powered directly by
the life-force of its billions of wielders!  With a second's effort we could
speak to one another even on opposite ends of the world!  It embodied all of
our kind's knowledge—and also contained the sum of our every impure desire!  Unspeakable
fantasies encountering each other and building on one another, degenerating
ever further into the seething pits of madness!  The ultimate wisdom combined
with the ultimate depravity, constantly accompanying us and whispering into our
ears!  I'm exaggerating here, but only slightly… anyway, that's how I grew up.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Wicked Vizier is looking down at his
knees.  “Although it's too late now, I wonder if we've arrived at an
unnecessary extreme.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“What do you mean?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Wicked Vizier seems to regain his
composure.  “Did the former rebellion's mages have time to explain to you the
principle of the Great Summoning Spell, before we captured their camp?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I lean back and frown.  This is not going as I
expected—but, if my one hundred percent chance of victory lies along some other
path, I will quickly swerve and seize it!  “Just the fundamentals of the
basics.  For instance, it was explained to me that the Great Summoning is
possible once every three centuries.  Thinking about the possibilities on my
way to the capital, I imagined that a charge builds up between the worlds, and
the spell discharges it.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Those details are not important right now. 
Did the mages explain to you that the Great Summoning Spell selects the Hero
with the greatest probability of achieving a specified outcome?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I nod.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Only Angelic mages can perform the Great
Summoning, which is why we didn't capture the site and perform the ritual
ourselves.  Furthermore, it is impossible to suborn an Angelic mage because
their Angels won't assist them in deliberate misdeeds.  The rule of using the
Hero to overturn the world's greatest evil has a long tradition behind it, so a
spy can't persuade the rebellion otherwise.  Then I pose to you this riddle:
how can an outsider exert their own influence over the Hero Summoning and use
it to their purpose?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Oh dear.  That anomalous one-hundred-percent
probability now seems more ominous.  “You changed the Spell's operation?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“That's also impossible.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I shift in my seat.  I'm relieved, but…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Wicked Vizier continues.  “First, realize
that since the Summoning Spell selects the Hero most likely to reach a final
outcome, anything leading to that outcome becomes more likely.  If a Hero with
blue hair is more likely to overthrow the Wicked Emperor, then the Hero is
likely to have blue hair—unless a Hero with green hair is still more likely to
overthrow the Emperor.  The mages who cast the Great Summoning expected that
the most likely path to the Hero's victory would be an exceptionally skilled
person who could command armies and wield great Angelic power.  But if some
other path is more likely to overthrow the Emperor, an entirely different kind
of Hero might be brought forth instead.  Do you follow me so far, Summoned Hero
Yugano Yuuki?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I nod.  “That's logical.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“It follows that if anyone has the power to
bring about the fulfillment of the Summoning Spell's condition, they can make
the Summoning Spell work to their own demands.  My faction has obtained the
power to effect that the Hero overturns the Wicked Emperor; we have a
surprising means to achieve this, allowing you to succeed with ease verging on
certainty.  We committed to carry out that act if the Summoned Hero met certain
other conditions.  Thus, fulfilling those conditions became the most probable
path by which a Hero could overturn the Emperor.  This plan seems to have
worked; from meeting you, it's clear that the Summoning Spell brought forth the
Hero <span class=0Text>we</span> sought.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>My jaw drops.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>This…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>This is…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Well, maybe it's not quite as clever as the
plots in Death Note.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>It takes me some time to reorder my thoughts
as the imagined world realigns around me.  “Then, for what purpose did <span
class=0Text>you</span> bring me here, Wicked Vizier-san?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“There are several conditions, but they should
be straightforward for someone with the right origin.  If we made the
conditions too difficult, it might be easier for the Summoning Spell to fulfill
its conditions by bringing forth a traditional Hero instead.  Of course, we did
surround the Rebellion's camp and crush them after the Summoning completed, to
make it as hard as possible for any Hero to win except the one we specified. 
Indeed, the only reason we permitted that Rebellion to exist in the first place
is so that Angelic mages would perform the Summoning Spell.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“I… see.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Then, we delayed our attack for an extra hour
to allow you to contract with an Angel.  The Angels won't deal with people who
already intend to abuse them, so everyone involved had to believe it was for
holy purposes.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>A nervous feeling is beginning to creep along
my spine, and not just because my Angel's muffled shrieking has increased in
pitch.  “That was very proactive of you.  I can honestly say that I'm impressed
with your attention to detail.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Oh, we've had many years in which to plan for
this day.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“It shows, Wicked Vizier-san.  This is easily
in the top twenty percent of wicked plots I've ever heard of - no, it might
even make the top ten percent.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Why, thank you.”  The Vizier leans back in
his seat.  “I've ordered kindly treatment for your heroic companion Taragon. 
The Rebellion's leaders were imprisoned rather than executed, just in case you
had already formed an affection for one of them.  We've gone to some lengths to
ensure you won't bear us a deadly grudge.  And it goes without saying that,
unlike Angelic mages, we don't expect the Summoned Hero to work without
reward.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“R-really?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Vizier taps his fingers together.  “One of
the necessities our faction considered was making it certain that the terms of
the Summoning Spell would be fulfilled.  We don't know precisely how the Spell
interprets requests like 'the Hero will overturn the Wicked Emperor'.  If we
just remove the Emperor ourselves, can we properly say that it's the Hero
herself who overturned the Emperor?  This ambiguity can't be tolerated if it
has any chance of upsetting our plan.”  The Vizier now wears a satisfied smile,
his narrow eyes peer at me closely.  “Thus, we have planned to fulfill the
Spell's required outcome of 'the Hero overturns the Wicked Emperor' by your
directly replacing him.  Should you meet the other conditions, you will become
the next Wicked Empress and be able to fulfill all your dark desires from atop
the Wicked Throne.  Do you like the sound of that, Perverted Hero Yugano
Yuuki?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Sure!”</span></p>

<p class=Para10><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=Para10><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>To clarify my previous response, I should
emphasize that I have a number of practical and moral qualms about becoming a
Wicked Empress.  This didn't stop me from immediately voicing my assent as a
matter of ingenuity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Even after I said yes, the Wicked Vizier was
coy about what goals I am required to accomplish.  Apparently they'll be
revealed to me one at a time in a certain order?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Well, it doesn't matter!  Whatever mysterious
conditions I must fulfill to become Empress, my success is something that's
assured!  I am still the Summoned Hero with a one hundred percent probability
of victory, so I will take the Wicked Vizier's conditions and crush them one
after another!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The elaborate shenanigans played with the
Great Summoning Spell don't change this essential truth!  At least, I don't see
yet why they would!  So I have every reason to hope that my success is certain!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>…I'm a little more nervous than I was before,
though.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The first stage of the plan is for me to
assume a new identity:  I am to pose as the Wicked Vizier's daughter.  Before,
this daughter has always been secluded on a remote estate due to being a bit
touched, but now she has mostly recovered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>This is to excuse any mistakes I might make as
being caused by lingering brain damage.  Clever, isn't it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>My new alias is Kiri, Heiress of Rolan.  (My
supposed father's name is Irir of Rolan, but everyone just calls him the Wicked
Vizier.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>As for that Summoned Hero Yugano Yuuki—so far
as the world knows, she was violated and then sacrificed to a Demon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Now, you might worry that people would be
suspicious of the way in which the Summoned Hero is brought to the palace for
execution, and then there's announced an exotic-looking daughter of the Wicked
Vizier that nobody has ever heard about before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>But apparently the Wicked Vizier has been
telling everyone the story of poor little Kiri for years.  He exhibited child
actresses wearing veils, so they could stammer and whisper bizarre things.  He
spoke months earlier about his daughter's ongoing recovery and her impending
arrival.  Thus, everyone here already has a concept of 'the Wicked Vizier's
secluded daughter recovering from mental disorder, expected to appear soon',
existing as a distinct person from that Summoned Hero they just now heard
about.  If I'd been male, they would have finalized a different plan involving
a dead duke's long-lost son, and so on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>A catgirl maid helps me dye my hair a
fashionable green, and do it up in the exotic hairstyle that everyone
associates to 'Heiress Kiri'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I'm to wear a veil over my face, which also
serves to conceal the Demonic prayer-strip that seals my Angel.  The Vizier
says that after everyone knows this veil-wearing person as Kiri, I can show my
face beneath.  Then, if one of the soldiers who saw the Summoned Hero perceives
a similarity in Kiri, it's just a strange coincidence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The courtiers already know that shy little
Kiri-chan habitually wears a veil.  It will be wonderful if Kiri shows her face
for the first time!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>People who have time to plan are scary.</span></p>

<p class=Para08><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>It's another bright morning in the Wicked
Empire, and Daddy—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Please don't call me that.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Yes, Wicked Vizier-san.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>—and some armored guards are taking me across
the city, to a school for people who want to become Demonic sorcerers.  This is
the place where I am to accomplish my first goal and meet one of the key
'conditions'.  What am I to do here?  The Wicked Vizier says this will soon
become obvious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>There's a bit of a fuss as the Wicked Vizier
presents Kiri-chan for entry as a beginning student of diabolism.  I just nod
along and say “Tee-hee!”, since I'm still observing the people around me.  I'm
trying to learn the local customs quickly, but I'm far from confident in my
ability to pass.  For now, I'm not ready to drop Kiri-chan's protective
reputation of simplicity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Headmistress of the school seems
disturbed, and she asks the Vizier to step aside into another room.  Of course
I press my ear up against the door and listen in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“—can't believe you!  That you'd risk your
poor sick daughter like this!  That you'd endanger her very soul!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Vizier's low voice.  “Kiri-chan's oddities
seem to have given her some strange desires, so she may as well profit herself
from all she's had to endure.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Does she even know what a Demon is?!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“That's what you're here to educate her about,
isn't it?  I believe she'll do well here.  Consider that an order.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Won't you reconsider?  Have you no qualms
regarding this?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Are you confused about whom you're
addressing?  Our government is called the Wicked Empire, not the Righteous
Empire.  I take pride in having personally contributed to that.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>…this is possibly concerning?  I might be
quite nervous right now if I didn't know I had a one hundred percent chance of
victory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The 'classroom' I'm shown to isn't like
anything from an ordinary school; it feels like sitting in a cathedral or a
museum, a huge half-circular room in which a few seating cushions narrowly
surround a high dais, where a man waits to lecture us.  Nearly all of the other
students seem to be young boys or older men; there's only one other girl my age
and she seems to be shrinking from the others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Oh, and all the other students here are
wearing masks.  But my hairstyle is clearly visible anyway, so I've just kept
the veil.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>One person starts as they see my hairstyle,
and then they lean over and whisper to one of their neighbors.  Soon murmured
exchanges are flying around the room.  The unmasked lecturer, who isn't part of
this whispered conspiracy, just watches me with some puzzlement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Finally the lecturer claps his hands, which
quiets the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“I'll begin with the very basics,” says the
lecturer.  “The magic of the world is divided into Good magic aligned with
Angels and Evil magic aligned with Demons.  A good mage derives power from
contracting with an Angelic being, who lends power in exchange for a commitment
to purity.  With diabolical sorcerers like you'll try to become, the case is
more complex.  In the old days, the method for becoming a sorcerer was simple
but inconvenient.  You compacted with a mid-rank demon to serve you for twenty-four
years, and at the end of those years they'd take your soul.  It's surprising in
retrospect how many people went along with this, since it's trading temporary
power for eternal damnation.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Personally, I can't say I'm surprised. 
There's always someone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The lecturer continues.  “Naturally, sorcerers
resented the price they had to pay.  There were many attempts to dissolve
compacts, and the same number of tragic failures.  Yet, no matter how many
ideas fail, it only takes one successful idea to change the world.  As we all
know now, the legendary genius Fausticus found a clever method to obtain
Demonic power without losing one's soul.  I have reviewed this history in order
to emphasize that if the current way of obtaining Demonic power seems risky or
even horrifying, it is at least better than the alternative.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Um.  I'm going to have to eat a kitten, aren't
I?  Oh god, I'm going to have to eat a kitten.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The lecturer paces energetically upon the
dais.  “Consider the puzzle Fausticus faced! There were many rituals to invoke
Demons; the ritual to gain twenty-four years of power was just the most
commonly used.  Other innovators had focused on performing the standard bargain
for twenty-four years, and then trying to avert the price afterwards. 
Fausticus's first great insight was to look at other rituals besides the
standard one.  Today we all know where Fausticus found his solution, in the
details of a little-used ritual to invoke a Succubus visitation.  But consider
how much searching Fausticus must have done through obscure grimoires, how many
strange notions he must have considered and rejected, before happening on his
tremendous idea!  And remember that Fausticus knew he could try only once.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>My ears perk up at the word 'succubus'.  I
don't know yet where this is going, but it sounds promising.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“On the surface, Demonic bargains seem to have
a certain symmetry.  Once the ritual is invoked, the Demon must absolutely obey
the conditions, on pain of their own soul being lost.  A Succubus, once
summoned, must satisfy any lust of the invoker for a period of three days.  As
with any other bargain, for the Demon to fail at this would mean the Demon
losing their own soul to the ritualist.  In theory, if you asked for something
the Demon strongly preferred not to do, the current compact could be annulled,
and a new compact forged, by the consent of both parties.  Yet it proved
impossible to force a Demon to invoke this clause.  Fausticus's critical
insight was to realize that <span class=0Text>any</span> named Demon could be
summoned into the succubus ritual, not just Demons under the Sin of Lust.  And
we all know the clever use that Fausticus made of that.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I don't know, but I keep quiet.  Maybe it'll
become clear soon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“The systematization of Fausticus's method is
the basis of modern sorcery.  Unfortunately, there are two key limitations on
our power, which is the reason why Angelic mages can still face us as equals. 
The first limitation is that to summon an exceptional Demon through the
succubus ritual, the invoker must be an exceptional person.  Some of you are
virgins, so Demons will be very interested in you; it's purity that they are
most driven to ruin.”</span></p>

<p class=Para03><span class=0Text><span lang=EN style='font-style:normal'>A-</span></span><span
lang=EN>ha.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I almost raise my hand before remembering to
softly clap my hands instead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Yes, you in the veil?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Then would it be even better to make an
Angelic compact first?  Tee-hee!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The lecturer laughs.  “Oh, if somebody under
an Angelic compact was willing to make a diabolical bargain, there isn't a
Demon in Hell who wouldn't respond!  Ruining a holy virgin of the Angels would
be an overriding goal for them.  But that's not a tactic we can use to our own
advantage, since the Angels won't compact with someone who intends to abuse
them.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>It's a good thing people can't see how widely
I'm smiling.  The logic of the master plan is becoming clear to me.  There,
there, you poor little Angel screaming on my shoulder, you won't have to put up
with me much longer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The lecturer's smile vanishes.  “But remember,
to become a modern sorcerer, you must first summon a Pride Demon instead of a
Lust Demon in the succubus ritual, then demand a sex act so shameful that a
Demon under Pride would rather forge a new compact than go along with it.  And,
the succubus ritual can only demand that the Demon serve your sincere lusts. 
During the three-day period of the succubus ritual, you can't order the Demon
to attack an enemy soldier—unless that act specifically arouses your desires in
<span class=0Text>that</span> way.  Then, anybody who forces a Pride Demon to
agree to a new compact rather than carry out some perversion, must truly lust
for that perversion.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>A-ha-HA.  Truly, the right Hero has been
Summoned to this world.  Even if I hadn't been told the probability, I would
estimate my chance of failing this stage as zero.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The lecturer speaks quietly, seeming abashed. 
“So that is the embarrassing truth at the core of the modern system, and the
reason why you are all wearing masks in shame of showing your faces.  Anyone
who enslaves a Demon must be somebody who desired an act so degenerate that
even Demons wouldn't perform it.  You're here because you believe you have a
desire like that, but if you're wrong, the price will be your very souls.  Your
only gain will be three days of pleasure, and then you'll be sucked into Hell
at the end of your life… yes, veiled girl?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“I'm sorry if I'm naive,” I say, keeping my
voice soft.  “I don't want to be a bother, but I don't know a lot of things
other people know.  What's an example of an act so perverted that a Demon won't
do it?  Tee-hee.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The lecturer's cheeks flush red.  “That's, ah…
I mean… well, not in my own personal case of course, but… I mean, obviously
sorcerers don't talk about what they did to succeed… but, there's a rumor that
one perverted desire is to have somebody put their m-mouth on your you-know and
lick until, until it happens.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>There are gasps from around the room.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>…hey.  You people.  Are you messing with me? 
I mean, really?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>It's true that I've read about countries and
eras when asking for oral-genital contact was grounds for a divorce, or times
when it was called a criminal act.  But is this really how some cultures are
before they invent online pornography?  That's hard for me to accept even after
seeing it.  History books are one thing, but this is reality!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“But, you don't need to desire anything so
extreme,” the lecturer says.  “There's many Demons that can be subdued more
easily than that, so you don't have to go so far.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>What perversion could go <span class=0Text>less</span>
far than oral sex?  I can't even imagine!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The lecturer clears his throat.  “That is the
second great limitation of modern sorcery.  Higher-ranked demons, more steeped
in wickedness, are more perverse themselves.  Even if you have purity enough to
attract greater Demons in the ritual, you mustn't overreach the rank of Demon
you request.  Be conservative!  Consider the risk if your unspeakable desire
turns out to be speakable!  As much as we might dream of the power we could
gain by enslaving a Duke of Hell, the attempt would inevitably end with your
own soul being lost.  No mortal could desire anything awful enough to shock a Demon
so deeply steeped in wickedness… is something wrong, veiled girl?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>AHA HA HA HA HAHAHAH AHA—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“I'm fine,” I say.  “Tee-hee.”</span></p>

<p class=Para10><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I dive into the subject matter of Demonic
Sorcery with an enthusiasm that I've never shown to any Earthly scholarship. 
I'm sorry, my old teachers.  Even if I'd tried hard to learn your material, I
would not have acquired superpowers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Every morning guards convey me to the College
of Diabolism in the University of the Wicked City.  In the afternoon I return
to the Vizier's palace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The food at the palace remains acceptable. 
Massages from bathing attendants are a new luxury that I enjoy.  When they're
fully dressed in the local maid outfit, the rating of the catgirls rises to 6
out of 10.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>But there isn't much more to life here that I
expect to enjoy, even as a Wicked Empress?  Cultured people go to hear
musicians play, but it will be five hundred years before anyone here can play
trance electronica.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I wonder if this world contains little that an
Earth girl would want.  There's no amount of golden coin that can buy a
Playstation.  I would seriously consider selling my soul to regain the
Internet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Still, the fact is that I'm here to stay, and
being Wicked Empress is better than being a peasant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Why am I pondering this?  Because even if I'm
already told that I'll become Empress with one hundred percent probability,
staying on as Empress for a long time is a different question.  Similarly,
there's the question of whether the Wicked Vizier and his friends will try to
control the new Empress behind the scenes.  'If they place you in power, they
can remove you from power' is an obvious thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>So, if I decide to be an Empress after
all—then, I must gather advantages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Which returns the subject to the College of

<p class=Para08><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“The highest-ranked Demon that has ever been
forced into a modern compact,” says the woman lecturing us, “is a Baron of Hell
under Pride.  But was that the most difficult Demon ever subdued?  No, because
there are more difficult targets than Demons under Pride.  Being governed by
the Sin of Pride makes a Demon more likely to balk at perversions.  Thus,
binding a Greater Demon under Greed is more difficult than subduing a Baron
under Pride.  Since compacted Demons under other Sins are rarer, their powers
are in higher demand.  However,” the woman's cheeks are flaming, but she forces
herself to continue, “I warn you that to essay this, you must be so perverted
that people wouldn't acknowledge you as a human being.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Shy little Kiri is trembling at this, which is
how it looks when Yugano Yuuki is trying not to laugh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“There's one sorcerer who subdued a Greater
Demon of Envy.  After his death, his testament explained where to find his
notes.  The person who found those notes nearly burned them, but the method has
been passed down to the instructors here.”  The lecturing woman pauses. 
“Everyone in this room who thinks they can't endure this horrifying revelation
should leave now.  Before I, before I say it.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Two-thirds of the students get up and leave
the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Kiri-chan… won't you go too?  It's really not
a thing you should hear.  People sometimes become sick on hearing it.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Kiri-chan shakes her head behind the veil.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Then,” the woman swallows, “the truth is…
that man had a desire to put his thing in the, the other hole.  Not the mouth…
the other other hole.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>This produces not so much horror, as
puzzlement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“The hole you… poop from.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>There are various reactions to this, but
nobody faints.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Afterwards, the teacher congratulates
Kiri-chan on enduring the class.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>You.  All of you.  You all fail.  You nobles
of the Wicked Empire whose very souls depend on cultivating a twisted desire, I
assign you all an E-rank in perversion.  No, an F-rank.  I'll have to invent
new Roman letters after Z to describe you.  This must be what it's like to live
as a nuclear physicist, surrounded by people who can't do multiplication.</span></p>

<p class=Para08><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=Para03><span lang=EN>Clap.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Yes, Kiri-chan?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Has anyone ever forced a Demon into losing
their soul to a human?  Tee-hee.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“What do you mean?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Suppose that instead of making the modern
bargain, you refused to annull the succubus ritual and kept requiring the Demon
to do terrible things with you.  Could you push the Demon to a breaking point
where they just couldn't obey anymore, and collect their soul outright?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The scholar tutoring me flinches.  “Kiri-chan,
that's an awful question… no, I'm sorry, Kiri-chan, I didn't mean it that way!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Poor little Kiri-chan slowly lifts her head
back up, having shrunk away from this disapproval.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The scholar speaks on.  “Really, that's an
excellent question!  The answer is that nothing like that has ever happened in
history.  All Demons are accustomed to obeying horrifying orders from their
superiors.  We know perversions that Pride Demons would rather serve us than
perform.  It's not as if they gain nothing from agreeing to serve you.  By
serving under someone more degenerate than themselves, they'll increase in
corruption and rise in the ranks of Hell.  But if you offered them no
alternative to your demand, they'd just obey you the way they'd submit to a
superior Demon's orders.  And then you'd lose your own soul, because you
wouldn't have nullified the succubus ritual.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Then, what does it even mean for a human to
collect a Demon's soul?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Nobody knows.”</span></p>

<p class=Para08><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=Para03><span lang=EN>Clap.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Yes, Kiri-chan?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“What's the highest rank of Lust Demon that's
ever been captured?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“E-eep!  Nobody would ever try that!  Even if
it was a Least Demon under Lust, you'd lose your soul for certain!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“What exactly happens to a human who loses
their soul to a Demon under Lust?  Tee-hee.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Nobody knows, Kiri-chan.  It's not as if we
can ask them.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Does the Lust Demon do perverted things with
them forever after, or—”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Nobody knows, Kiri-chan!”</span></p>

<p class=Para08><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=Para03><span lang=EN>Clap.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Yes, Kiri-chan?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“I know no Demon higher than a Baron has been
subdued.  But, what higher ranks exist?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The woman tutoring me shows some relief that I
haven't asked a terrible question this time.  “The ranks are Least Demon,
Lesser Demon, Greater Demon, Higher Demon, Knight of Hell, Baron of Hell. 
Above the Barons are the Counts of Hell, and then the Seven Dukes.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Seven Dukes for Seven Sins?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“That's right, Kiri-chan.  For the Seven we
say, 'the Duke above Pride'.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Is there anyone above the Dukes?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Only the Devil.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“And is there any rumor of something more
powerful and wicked than the Devil?  Like, the First Darkness from before the
dawn of time, or anything like that?  And if so, would it be an entity we could
subdue by sufficient perversion, or would it be entirely alien to human
desire—”</span></p>

<p class=Para08><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=Para03><span lang=EN>Clap.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Yes, Kiri-chan?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Would more lustful people also be more
powerful as Angelic mages?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The lecturer looks puzzled. “Why in the world
would that be?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Be-because… it's a holier sacrifice to
repress a stronger temptation to sin?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Somebody in the class giggles, and the
lecturer smiles.  “No, Kiri-chan.  The Angels might still compact with someone
like that, but it's purity of motive that increases our enemies' power.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>It seems I misunderstood a certain idea <span
class=0Text>from the very beginning,</span> but thankfully that isn't important
any more.</span></p>

<p class=Para08><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>By the way, for an institution that's devoted
to making compacts with Demons, in the capital city of something called the
Wicked Empire, this school isn't very evil.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>People kindly treat that slightly touched girl
called Kiri-chan.  Well, I could pass that off as them currying favor with the
Wicked Vizier.  But to the extent I can see anything by keeping my eyes open,
it seems other students aren't being bullied either.  Senior students cheerfully
assist junior ones.  This must say something deep about human nature, but I
have no idea what.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Most of the so-called curriculum is wasted on
me, so it's the technical aspects of the craft that I study with the most
eagerness.  Using a ritual circle inscribed on stone.  Memorizing the
invocation to be spoken, the way the seven torches are arranged.  This part
seems straightforward to me.  I think I can carry out this ritual.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Then, there's only one last decision to be
made.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Should I summon the highest rank of Pride
Demon, the Duke above Pride?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Should I summon a Count under some other Sin?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Should I become the first person ever to
capture a Lust Demon?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Should I try to break a Demon outright with my
perverted demands, and become the first human to own a Demon's soul?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>O~r should I try to summon the Overlord of
Hell above the Seven Sins, Satan Lucifuge Asmodei Ahriman Moloch Melkor
Leviathan?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Let's list out the considerations pertaining
to this key life decision.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>First, it's possible that the Seven Dukes aren't
to be mentioned in the same breath as lower Demons.  There's some indication of
that in older grimoires, from when diabolists made different compacts.  Other
demons have risen and fallen in rank, but the Seven Dukes have stayed constant
for as long as anyone remembers.  From the standpoint of a would-be demon
catcher, there could be an unguessably large gap in difficulty between the
Count under Pride and the Duke above Pride.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Or another question:  A Greater Wrath Demon is
at least as resistant as a Baron under Pride.  How difficult then is a Count
under Wrath?  Maybe even I wouldn't be perverted enough?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Where does a Lust Demon stand relative to all
this?  Nobody knows, because nobody's ever caught a Lust Demon at all.  A
Knight under Lust could be equivalent to a teenage boy with Internet access! 
There's no way of knowing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>It's the same for revolting a Demon so much
that they just can't obey you, in order for you to obtain their soul outright. 
It's never been done, thus, nobody knows where it stands on to the difficulty
scale.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>In all cases, it's the same dilemma at the
core.  These incompetent perverts have explored the space of diabolism up to a
certain boundary.  As a competent pervert, it would be a waste for me to only
go a small step further.  But when it's all unknown space after that, how large
a leap should I try when failure means losing my soul?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>And finally, consider Satan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Technically, Satan is the Devil above Pride,
and Pride Demons are the easiest to catch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>But Satan is also the Devil above Lust.  A
Least Lust Demon is higher in perversion than a Baron under Pride. The Duke
above Lust must be far more perverted than anything a human of this world can
imagine, though that's not saying much.  Then, Satan should be more twisted
yet—but also prideful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I think if I hadn't been told my probability
of victory was one hundred percent, I would play it safe and settle for a Baron
under one of the other Sins.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>But Yugano Yuuki is the Summoned Hero with a
one hundred percent chance of victory!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Maybe!  I'm more worried about relying on that
now!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Trying to catch Satan might be pushing it too
far!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>It could upset the cosmic order or have
unknown consequences if I succeed!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>So I have to look myself in the mirror and
ask—did the Summoning Spell assign me a one hundred percent chance of victory
because I'm somebody wise enough to choose a safe course with margin for
error?  Or because I'm someone whose incredible corruption is more than equal
to the most difficult task?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>O~h, my answer to this dilemma will really
reveal my character, won't it?  What should I do~?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>This life-changing decision has now become an
urgent question for me!  Whatever my answer, I'd better decide soon!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Keeping my Angel by not being sinful with
myself—I can't bear it much longer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>About my decision:  I’ve decided to be
sensible and invoke a Count of Hell under a Sin other than Pride or Lust.  I
told the Vizier that, and asked him which Sin he recommended.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Yugano Yuuki… do you really think you can do
that?  No, are you certain you can do it?  To us, it’s all our plans at stake

this world shriek and faint when exposed to the concept of threesomes.  They
could experience actual heart failure if I explain something on the order of

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>A grave nod from the Wicked Vizier.  “Have the
scholars of diabolism answered all the questions that you have?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“They’ve told me all the answers that they

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The most important question I have is this:  ‘If
everyone in this culture is ludicrously innocent, does even their Hell reflect
that innocence under some law of souls?’</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>But that’s not something anyone here would
know.  To them, this state of affairs is natural and they’ve never questioned
it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Oh, and I didn’t wimp out completely.  I’m not
telling this to the Vizier, but I’m planning to test the Demon to see how it
responds to simpler perversions.  If it seems shocked, I won’t offer it an
alternative compact.  Instead I’ll try to break its obedience and take its soul
outright.  I’m guessing a Count is the highest level of Demon where I could do
that without cosmic repercussions?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Anyway, the Vizier advised me to choose a
Count of Wrath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>That question itself had been a test on my
part.  I’d already decided that a Demon of military force was most suitable to
support an Empress.  So I’m relieved the Vizier also said Wrath?  It means he’s
okay with me wanting to wield real power.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Unless the Vizier is planning to betray me in
an elaborate way that’s harder to understand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>That evening we went to the Vizier’s hidden
library, where he took out an old Grand Grimoire from before modern sorcery. 
From that tome I learned the name of AMON AESMA, serving beneath the Duke above
Wrath (called PUT SATANACHIA).  The nature of AMON AESMA is ill-timed vengeance
and righteous violence that defeats its own purpose.  A bit scary, but the
other Counts of Hell under Wrath sounded even worse?  His insignia is supposed
to indicate a claw mark over a ruined eye, but it looks like a poorly designed
logo for an Internet company.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>And now it’s time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>For a modern sorcerer to invoke a Count under
Wrath is absolutely unheard-of.  This is not a feat to associate with the
identity of ‘Kiri’.  Furthermore, the ritual requires me to speak my own name.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Therefore, the usual supervisors aren’t
allowed to watch this ritual.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>And the Vizier isn’t an experienced sorcerer
himself, so he can’t come either.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>In the end, I’ll be doing this alone.</span></p>

<p class=Para08><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Mid-night is approaching, the time exactly
between sunset and sunrise, that here they call the witching hour.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Ritual Room is a great stone chamber,
domed and windowless, lit only by seven torches that flame with seven colors of
smoke.  When I summon the Demon under Wrath, the red torch will flare up.  It
might even burn all its fuel and go out, since the rank of AMON AESMA is so
high.  That's how I'll know that I've succeeded, even before the Demon
manifests fully.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Upon the floor, a pentagram inside a circle
inside a pentagram.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>On the other side of the chamber is a door
that goes into a bedchamber, where I’ll be staying for up to seventy-two hours
after this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Slowly, my heart pounding faster, I strip off
my clothes until I am standing naked before the pentagram.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Then I don the clothes I had the Vizier’s
seamstresses make for me.  Stockings that go up to my mid-thigh, panties that
are lacy and impractical.  A short skirt that goes almost but not quite to the
stockings, creating my absolute territory.  A stiff corset, to constrain my
belly and uplift my breasts.  With this, I'm dressed to enter the pictures I've
browsed for so long.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>In this way I remind myself that I undertake
this endeavor not as a hero from another world, but as a girl of Earth who’s
been corrupted by the Internet.  Any trace of decency I might have acquired in
this dimension is something I should put behind me now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The last preliminary is a golden-inked prayer
strip that I press to my forehead.  The blood-scarlet prayer strip that’s
stayed there up until now, comes loose with a little ‘plop’.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I look at the Angel hovering over my shoulder,
who up until this time has only been able to wail.  I've kept him this long so
that I could have sanctity to sacrifice to a Demon, and that's a bit…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“I’m sorry,” I tell him.  “For everything.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Don’t do it,” he whispers.  It seems he’s now
grown close enough to my soul to speak to me.  “It’s not too late, Yugano
Yuuki.  You could make another choice<span class=0Text>.</span>”</span></p>

<p class=Para03><span lang=EN>I believe that what I am doing will be for the
good of all the people under the Wicked Empire.</span><span class=0Text><span
lang=EN style='font-style:normal'>  I send that thought to him, because I’m not
sure it’s safe to say aloud even here.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Don’t,” whispers the Angel.  That tiny,
bishounen face stares up at me like he’s watching the death of God.  He has a
look of hopelessness about him, like he knows he can’t talk me out of it. 
“You’ll lose your soul, and even if you succeed, you’ll lose your soul. 
There’s nothing good that can come of this for you.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I swallow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Then I stride to the middle of the pentagram
and speak.  “Ash.  Dust.  Desert.  Emptiness.  Death to fire, death to earth,
death to water, death to air.  In the center of all things there is a white
flower.  A drop of my blood falls upon the petals as a sign.  The book of law
contains protections for mortal beings.  I forfeit these protections.  I forfeit
these protections.  I forfeit these protections.  I open my heart to the gaze
of Hell.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>An actinic taste comes into the air, and the
lines on the floor flare up into black fire.  With those words spoken, there’s
no turning back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“My body will be under your dominion, your
soul will be mine if you refuse my lust.  A night, a day, a night, a day, a
night, a day.  Fading into sunset.  Ending as it began, on this witching hour. 
Yugano Yuuki, Yugano Yuuki, Yugano Yuuki.  I offer that soul as a payment.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>My heart is pounding wildly, the meaning of
what I’m doing is really dawning on me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I’m—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I’m about to—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>In just a few minutes—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>It’ll be time for me to finally lose my
vir-gi-ni-ty!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Appare, appare, appare.”  The tingling in the
air becomes more intense.  “This sanctified virgin speaks your name and invokes
you to come forth—”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Oh, why not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“—SATAN LUCIFUGE ASMODEI AHRIMAN MOLOCH MELKOR
LEVIATHAN!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>There’s a sound like a million tons of
shattering glass, and all seven of the torches flare hugely and then go out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Ah, the Devil is above all Seven Sins, so of
course it wouldn’t be just one of the torches that flare.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>As a consequence, this room really has gone
completely dark.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>There’s no seeing anything at all, like if the
Devil is standing right behind me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Well, I’m not going to just stand here in the
dark like an idiot.  Keeping calm, I stride towards the door to the bedroom.  I
keep a hand out as best I can, but I still have to grope a bit to find the
doorknob.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The bedroom has its own light, so as soon as
the door opens, I turn around.  In dim light I behold the Devil, gazing at me
with a cold expression that seems to travel straight down my spine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Uh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Um.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I’m not sure how long I spend staring at him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Compared to even an Angel, the Devil is…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“You’ll do,” I tell him.  My mouth is dry, I
cannot swallow.  “Now, come into my parlour.”</span></p>

<p class=Para10><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I usually feel good about my last-minute
impulse decisions, but in retrospect, that one was a bit… large?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>It could be literally the silliest decision
that anyone has ever made.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>If you consider the legendary errors, then
right after 'Don't invade Russia during the wintertime' would be 'Don't stake
your soul on defeating the Devil, but if you do, at least don't have it be a
pervertedness contest'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>But I can't help it—when I see the Devil in
front of me, I regret nothing.  His limbs are lithely muscled, and pale in the
dim light.  There's a white cloth about him, thin as a veil, wrapped like a
toga, obscuring everything and hiding nothing.  His face is indescribable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>After a timeless eternity, I don't know how
long, the Devil smiles, and steps forwards to approach the bedchamber where I
stand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“It's been a long time since any mortal dared
to treat with me.  To be summoned under <span class=0Text>this</span> ritual,
by a holy virgin offering up her flesh, her sanctity and her soul… in all of
eternity that's never happened.  I'll give you unimaginable pleasure as a
reward for that audacity.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>My mind is a bit fuzzy right now.  It could be
the smoke from the seven spent torches, or it could be the male form hammering
into my eyeballs.  Even so, I remember the words that I should say next.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Satan Lucifuge Asmodei Ahriman Moloch Melkor
Leviathan…”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Devil raises a single eyebrow.  “Yes?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Under the name of Yugano Yuuki I swear, I
swear, I swear, that if at any time you wish to refuse my lusts as unendurable,
you may say 'I accept your alternative compact' to annull this succubus ritual
and institute instead your oath—”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“You must be joking.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“—to lend me your power for the rest of my
mortal days, until the limitations of the book of law.  Nor yet shall you
receive my soul.  Your compensation will be to learn under me in order to gain
in corruption and…” <span class=0Text>he can't rise any further in the ranks of
Hell,</span> “and that's it.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Devil has let me speak all this without
further interruption.  When I'm done, he takes a step closer to me.  It feels
like I'm choking just from the air being so thick with his presence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“You have some nerve,” he murmurs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Well, I won't deny that.”  I try for a laugh,
but it comes out sounding shaky.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Are you just making life more interesting for
yourself, or do you really imagine that you can do this?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>My heart is beating far out of control, but I
manage to say, “Transform yourself into a girl.  As the Devil above Envy, you
can do that, right?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Devil gazes at me, then slowly smiles. 
“As you wish,” he murmurs, and—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>—sorry, my brain cut out for a while.  She's
not wearing any clothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>When I've recovered, I say, “Devil above
Greed, make me a cup.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Devil's female form hands me a golden
goblet fit to be the Grail.  The gold seems to shimmer below the surface in a
pattern that's not quite as beautiful as a fractal screensaver.  Okay, that
thought is a good sign, my brain is recovering from this exposure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I'm Yugano Yuuki, the girl who's been ruined
by the Internet.  The Devil is unimaginably beautiful as a man or a woman, I
can't deny.  But it remains to be determined how the depth of this world's Hell
stacks up against Earth's online forums.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>My voice is a bit unsteady, but I speak, and
it steadies as I go.  “So, you see how many girls are in this room?  Two.  You
see how many cups are in this room?  One.  I'm a kindly master who won't resort
to that if I don't have to, but with this, I've already won.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Devil's eyes become cooler.  Veils gather
about her once more, and he's transformed into male again.  “Beginning with
your victory declaration against me, the supreme evil?  You've gone beyond
audacity into the realm of delusion, mortal.  I've spent millennia steeped in
wickedness beyond your capacity to imagine.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Ha!  If one person spends a thousand years
thinking perverted thoughts, that's no better than a thousand people spending
one year thinking perverted thoughts!  I'm not facing you alone, for behind me
is the decadence of an entire planet!  Even if the race of Earth can't win at
anything else, we won't lose at degenerate pornography!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Devil steps close enough to me that I can
smell his breath, fragrant like spices.  From this close I can see more of the
human shape beneath his veils.  He lifts a hand up to my face and my knees go
weak as he slides a thumb into my mouth.  Oh, god, I'm sucking it.  Licking it
shamefully like the Internet has taught me.  All the repressed sexual energy of
these last three weeks is lighting a fire inside me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Devil withdraws his thumb.  “Interesting,”
he murmurs.  “Now that I've touched you and gained the measure of your sins,
girl from another world… you might have as much perversion inside you as the
governor I set over Lust.  Not enough to conquer me or any of my seven.  But
enough to make this encounter truly enjoyable for me.  You weren't nearly as
foolish as I thought—but still, I declare my own victory.  I'll have you endure
pleasures you've never imagined, and make your soul belong to me even before
these hours end.”</span></p>

<p class=Para03><span class=0Text><span lang=EN style='font-style:normal'>The
dismay inside me rises up, crashes against two protective thoughts:  </span></span><span
lang=EN>One hundred percent chance of victory </span><span class=0Text><span
lang=EN style='font-style:normal'>and </span></span><span lang=EN>the Devil can
lie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Certainly, I won't give up before three days
have passed.  I'll set my perversions against him to the very end.  If I fail,
it won't be with a single fantasy of mine left unfulfilled.  No, I'll do my
best to break through to a new level of twistedness if that's what it takes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I go over to the wide bed and sit down on it. 
The Devil remains standing, watching me with smoky eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>All my limbs are trembling with hope, despair,
and the torrent of heat pouring through me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I look at the Devil and ask myself—what will I
have from him first?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>This man of ultimate beauty, ultimate confidence,
with the strength of Hell and the supreme authority of wickedness—how does the
woman in me respond to that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Thinking this, I already know the answer that
rises up from my depths.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I reach out my trembling fingers and slowly
unroll my left leg's stocking, removing it to leave my foot bare.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Then, we might as well begin with the
basics,” I say.  “Now suckle on my toes, slave.”</span></p>

name="11_____The_meaning_of_probability_is__"></a><a name="_Toc441830902"><span
lang=EN>11.    The meaning of probability is—</span></a></h1>

<p class=Para10><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=Para10><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=Para10><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Let's pause at this critical juncture to
contemplate the nature of probability.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>What does it mean when the white mages say,
“The Summoning Spell determined that you have a one hundred percent chance of
victory?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Does it represent an absolute determination? 
One hundred point zero zero percent, total certainty?  Or does it just mean the
probability is closer to 100% than to 99%?  Does the Summoning Spell round to
the nearest 10%, in which case I could have a 5% chance of losing?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>When I considered that, I remembered that a
white mage spoke as if gradations as small as “two percent” could be
determined.  If they weren't just speaking figuratively, then at least the
probability is closer to one hundred percent than to ninety-eight percent.  But
an absolute certainty is probably impossible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Or a deeper thought:  In the end, every event
either happens or it doesn't.  Even if you say that a coin has a fifty percent
probability of landing on heads, in the end it either shows heads or shows
tails.  Then if the Spell looks into the future, how can the Spell determine
any probability other than zero percent or one hundred percent?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>One guess is that maybe this universe has
something analogous to quantum decisions that are irreducibly random.  These
tiny alternatives, by the butterfly effect, would be amplified into affecting
larger outcomes like 'Yugano Yuuki overturns the Wicked Emperor' or 'Yugano
Yuuki does not overturn the Wicked Emperor'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Then, the meaning of the Spell's estimate
would be that after accounting for tiny divergences and how they affect the
world, in nearly all the possibilities Yugano Yuuki overturns the Wicked
Emperor.  Not just nine possibilities out of ten or even nineteen times out of
twenty, but ninety-nine out of one hundred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>In that case my victories shouldn't be
obtained by the last inch of my fingernails.  If I was on the verge of losing
before a desperate effort, mightn't some small event like a falling pebble
perturb the outcome?  A narrow victory shouldn't be one that happens in
ninety-nine worlds out of one hundred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Realistically, there is nowhere I could have
ended up after my Summoning except in the office of the Wicked Vizier making
his offer.  Maybe the right falling pebble could have altered that, but the
vast majority of falling pebbles wouldn't.  If I'd wantonly committed suicide,
that could have prevented me from reaching the Vizier's office.  But that
choice would be uncharacteristic of me, and someone watching me from the
outside would call it unlikely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>So, looking back, my course up to the Vizier's
office seems overdetermined.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>If I win in more than ninety-nine out of one
hundred worlds, that's how <span class=0Text>every</span> flag event should
appear in retrospect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>This story of Yugano Yuuki doesn't belong to
the shounen genre—is what that implies.  I won't ever win at the last minute.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Of course, a further implication is that I
shouldn't do things based on random whims.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Was 'Yugano Yuuki will go for the big one and
summon the Devil himself' an overdetermined event?  Was it something that
anyone who knew me could have guessed?  To me, it feels like I didn't decide it
myself until the last minute.  Then, was my choice a fragile event that could
have been altered by a bird flying past me in the morning?  In the latter case,
by choosing on a last-minute whim, I might have departed the track of the
ninety-nine worlds and wandered into the uncertain open space of the hundredth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I myself have no way of knowing whether my
choice was overdetermined or a whim, except by seeing whether the consequence
is victory or failure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I wish I could say I worked that out in
advance, but the truth is I saw it afterwards.</span></p>

<p class=Para08><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The state I'm in when I emerge from the
sorcerer's bedchamber—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>There's a perversion called 'ruined orgasm'
that's part of the 'teasing and denial' fetish.  You slowly stimulate yourself
until you're almost ready to come, and then push yourself over the edge.  As
soon as you can't stop yourself from falling over that edge, you snatch your
hands away and feel the empty pulsations inside you, contractions without real
pleasure.  It's more of a torment assigned to submissives, than something that
people naturally enjoy.  I tried it once and, nope.  Raising all that tension,
all that anticipation, and then letting it drain away into frustration and
emptiness…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>That's how I feel when I stagger out of that
bedchamber <span class=0Text>with my virginity intact.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Devil trails after me, the ancient being
still looking stunned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>So.  On the one hand, nobody's ever pushed a
Demon into outright refusing an order and losing their soul.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Why?  Because Demons are accustomed to taking
orders from their superiors in Hell's hierarchy; they already have ancient
mental habits in place for obeying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>But there's one entity in Hell who's an
exception to that rule, isn't there?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>From my womanly desire to see a beautiful,
powerful man kneeling before me in subjugation, I treated the Devil as an 'M'
and told him to suckle on my toes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Devil gave me an amused look, as though to
convey 'fat chance'.</span></p>

<p class=Para03><span lang=EN>He didn't speak the words to accept my
alternative compact.  He just refused my lust.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I, Yugano Yuuki, am the woman to whom the
Devil lost his soul.  By the time either of us could have asked if we wanted
that to happen, the succubus ritual had already shattered around us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>This is what it's like to be on a one hundred
percent probable path to victory, I guess?  Regardless of my exact actions once
the ritual began, that flag would have tripped before three days had passed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>And, this is what it means to be trapped in a
self-fulfilling prophecy. Because <span class=0Text>nobody</span> would ever
have tried this if they hadn't been told they were <span class=0Text>certain</span>
to succeed.  I think that maybe if I'd been told eighty percent, I would have
tried for the Duke above Pride, and lost, which would have made the probability
nearly zero.  If I'd been told fifty percent, I would have tried for a Count
under Pride and won.  So in the end, the most self-consistent probability that
could be told to me was a one hundred percent chance of victory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>You white mages who peeked at the probability…
you made a weird event happen.  If any cosmic forces show up asking for an
explanation, I'm disclaiming all responsibility and passing them on to you.</span></p>

<p class=Para10><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Wicked Vizier seems to relax when he sees
me staggering down the halls.  Then he chokes and turns away.  “What are you
wearing?!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>It seems I forgot to change out of those
clothes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Well,” says the Wicked Vizier, still not
looking at me.  “I'm not disappointed to see that you changed your mind and
backed out.  You might feel ashamed of it, but I believe it shows wisdom to
wait and consider.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>It also seems he can't see the Devil behind
me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Actually… I didn't back out.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Wicked Vizier whirls on me, then chokes
again and averts his eyes.  “What?  Then what are you doing here?  Quick, go
back and complete the ritual!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“It's done.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“That fast—?!”  The Wicked Vizier seems to
steel himself, then he stares at me.  “No, I see faint signs of a halo about
you!  You still have your Angel, unsealed!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>YES.  YES I DO.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>After I recovered from the shock, I thought of
going right back into that bedchamber and finishing what we'd started, but— </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Devil pleaded with me.  He sounded like he
was strangling himself, but he pleaded with me.  If my Angel leaves me, he must
return to Heaven and report this situation to the factions there, and then the
Devil himself doesn't know what will happen after.  I asked my Angel, but he
didn't know either.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I'm NOT HAPPY with this situation, but I'm
keeping the Angel <span class=0Text>temporarily.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Wicked Vizier looks worried.  “Yugano
Yuuki, tell me the truth this time!  What happened?  If you've made an error
and damned yourself—”  The Vizier shakes his head.  “No!  No, that can't have
happened!  We wouldn't make you Empress then, and in that case, you never
should've been Summoned here to begin with!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Ah,” I say, “it seems a fluke event has
occurred.  Before I could have my so-called purity ruined, the Demon refused my
lust outright, and…”  I put a hand against my head.  “Do you know what a
human's supposed to do if she owns a Demon's soul?  How to make him obey me or
lend me power?  Right now he's just following me around.”  A thought occurs to
me, and I turn my head to address the Angel hovering over my shoulder.  “Do you
know, Angel?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Don't you dare say a word to her!” hisses the
Devil.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The little Angel has his hands over his face. 
“I'm not advising you about anything at this point, Yugano Yuuki.  Your life is
too strange.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Meanwhile, the Wicked Vizier is clutching his
head.  “That's—just what kind of world did you—but if you say it's so,
then—should we consult the sages?  No!  They can't be allowed to know!  But
then—gah!”  The Vizier spins around in a full circle, hands still fisted in his
hair.  “No, if it's like this, can you still wield supreme diabolical power?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>A thought occurs to me, and I turn to the
Devil.  “Hey you, make me some chocolate.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Devil snorts.  “Why should I?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Make me some chocolate, or my hand goes into
my panties and starts rubbing.”</span></p>

<p class=Para03><span class=0Text><span lang=EN style='font-style:normal'>Ignoring
the gargle from the Wicked Vizier, I smile at the Devil as he absorbs my
threat.  If I do </span></span><span lang=EN>that</span><span class=0Text><span
lang=EN style='font-style:normal'>, my Angel departs.  Returns to Heaven.  And
talks.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Devil's eyes flare.  “You…”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“You know, even when you're angry, you're not
actually as scary as a horror movie… no, wait, never mind, that's competitive.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Averting my eyes, I hand the chocolate back to
the Vizier.  “There, I figured out how to make my Demon do things for me.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“You invoked a Demon under Greed instead?” 
The Vizier looks puzzled.  He raises the chocolate to stare at it, then
sniffs.  “No… Gluttony?  What have you done <span class=0Text>now</span>,
Yugano Yuuki?!  How will the dread powers of Gluttony stabilize your reign as Empress?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“That's a bit of a complicated story…”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“You did it because you missed the food from
your previous world?!”  Now the Wicked Vizier is glaring at me.  “So far I've
refrained from criticizing your decision-making on grounds of your youth, but
this is unbelievably irresponsible!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Darn it.  I thought I'd keep this secret for
longer than that.  “Well, that's not it.  I suppose you could call it my
slothfulness?  I wasn't sure what your conspiracy meant me to do once I
finished binding a Demon?  But if I had to make a sincere effort this one time,
I at least wanted everything afterwards to be easy.  So I summoned Satan.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The chocolate drops from the Wicked Vizier's
fingers and he slumps to the side, but thanks to my alert reflexes I manage to
leap forward and catch the chocolate.</span></p>

<p class=Para08><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The next morning, after eating a passable
breakfast with the Devil standing behind me, the Wicked Vizier summons me into
a palace meeting-chamber.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Already sitting in the head chair of the table
when we arrive is a middle-aged man I don't recognize, clad all in black.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Summoned Hero Yuuki,” the Wicked Vizier says,
“you can show your face to this man; he's the final member of our conspiracy.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I flip over my veil and slide into a seat,
gazing in puzzlement at the black-clad man at the head of the table.  Should I
recognize this person?  There's something reminiscent about his face, but I'm
sure I've never met him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Wicked Vizier takes a seat himself.  “Both
of us thought it might be prudent not to tell you for a while about what's going
on.  However, after the events of last night, we've reconsidered that policy. 
I would say that I'm worried you might go to further extremes, if not for the
fact that I literally can't imagine how.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>That's a bit harsh, but also a bit fair. 
“Then, what am I to do next?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The man at the head of the table speaks. 
“Fundamentally, you need to master politics, management, and a skill we might
term 'discretion'.  My thought is to first introduce you at the Wicked Court
and let you have some fun there; you must learn to recognize false friends and
those who'd take advantage of you.  You should continue posing as 'Kiri of
Rolan' to accomplish that.  Afterwards, I'll place you in charge of a business
for a while, followed by a term as a regional judge.  Then we might have you
govern a province, in order to test your competence.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I frown, puzzled.  “I can see how that much is
prudent, given that I must become Wicked Empress as part of your plot to seize
control of the Summoning Spell…”  I look back and forth between the man and the
Wicked Vizier, both of them watching me.  “But, what else?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“The Vizier says that you seem unimpressed
with the luxuries of this Empire.  Why is that?  Were you already a princess in
your former world?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“I don't mean any offense by this.  But my
home world of Earth is older than this place, more mature.  Simply put, Earth
stands in the same relation to this world as an adult does to a child.  The
adult isn't always kinder or happier than the child, but the adult is more
sophisticated.  By my standards, a tall building should be a hundred stories
high.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Hm.  Then, does your sophisticated world
perhaps have more mature ideas about how to rule a country?  Or is the art
behind those huge buildings something you can teach?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I slowly nod.  I can't call myself an expert
on anything, but I know… that farmers should try rotating their crops, the idea
of a printing press with movable type, the concept of scientific investigation,
the goal of developing machines to improve production, the theory of evolution
and the concept of animal breeding, the core idea from economics that weird
retribution is visited upon governments that try to regulate prices away from
the balancing point of supply and demand… actually, by local standards I know a
number of important things, don't I?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The black-clad man speaks again.  “Marvelous. 
Well, I'll have you speak of your world's ways to me before I approve your
becoming Empress.  I won't set myself up as a skeptic of your world's wisdom,
but I need to know it's not just the purposeless taboos of a foreign land.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Devil is laughing to himself, though it
has a bitter sound.  Neither fact reassures me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Again, that all sounds very sensible…”  I
have an ominous feeling about this.  “But, you haven't answered the most
important questions.  For what purpose did you twist the Summoning Spell to
bring me here?  What other conditions must I carry out for you to make me
Empress?  And how do you mean to ensure that I overturn the Wicked Emperor?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The black-clad man smiles.  “Oh, you still
haven't recognized me, then? I guess you haven't handled much of this country's
coinage.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“You're the Wicked Emperor?!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“I am!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Then, you'll just step aside for me when the
time comes, ensuring that part of the plan succeeds with one hundred percent
probability?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Indeed!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“But then, the mysterious deed that you'll
require me to accomplish before that—”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“There isn't one!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I gasp.  “Then, the whole purpose of this plot
was just to obtain a candidate for the Empire's succession?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Yes, by—”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“By Summoning a woman with the wisdom of
another world who, as a perverted virgin, could also become an Empress that
wields supreme diabolical power!  That would stabilize the changes of her reign
against personally targeted forms of revolutionary activity, and also relieve
the civil government's need to treat with powerful diabolists in order to gain
protection from other powerful diabolists—”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Precisely!”  The Wicked Emperor interrupts
me.  “To that end, I even began calling myself the Wicked Emperor!  I spread
false rumors of corruption, so that every province thinks itself the only
righteous one in my Empire!  Have you noticed how even though everything here
is called 'wicked this' and 'wicked that', it's hard to spot any evil right in
front of you?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Not particularly, but I see it now!  It was
all to lure the senior Angelic mages into targeting you so that you could shape
the outcome of the Summoning Spell!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Yes!   Those tradition-bound greyheads
wouldn't go along with it when I first petitioned them all those decades ago! 
Even though there are some problems that can't be remedied just by
assassinating one evil overlord every three centuries!  All of this, all my
planning over these years, has been for the sake of my great plan to save this
world that is descending into chaos under the pressures of modern diabolism!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Well, that makes perfect sense, then!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“A plan to which you are the key, Yugano
Yuuki!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“I understand, and I'll go along with it!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“The fate of this world depends on you!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“I know!  I said I'll do it, so you can stop
persuading me!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I think the Emperor has been waiting a long
time to explain to someone about this plan.</span></p>

<p class=Para10><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=Para10><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=Para10><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Emperor insists on continuing to explain
for a long time, though after a while it turns into more of a briefing on the
Empire's state.  Eventually darkness falls, as it always does, and I head back
to my bedchamber.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I doubt I'll be able to sleep tonight. 
Yesterday, I was exhausted enough that I was able to fall asleep despite the
Devil standing silently next to my bed.  Tonight I can look forward to a long
time tossing and turning—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>No, that's silly, the Devil is above the Sin
of Sloth.  There's no insomnia in this world that would withstand his supreme
Sloth powers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I begin stripping off my clothes in
preparation for donning pajamas, aware that the Devil is also watching me, as
is the Angel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>To say that I feel unworthy of my fate is
putting it mildly.  I know so little that it horrifies me.  Other people from
Earth would do far better in my place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>And, I think I know what went wrong.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>In retrospect, the Emperor should have
committed himself to demand more otherworldly knowledge from the person he
Summoned, as his condition of setting that person on the throne.  But a person
from this world has no sense of where to place that threshold.  If the Summoned
Hero knows about the scientific method but only barely passed her calculus
class, is that a lot of knowledge or a little knowledge?  Nobody here knows the
difference!  Whereas in this world's concept of diabolism, 'she took the
Devil's soul' is understandable as the greatest possible win.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Since I have a one hundred percent chance of
victory, I expect that my paltry share of Earth's knowledge will amaze the
Emperor, and he'll readily confirm me for the throne.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>And once the Summoning Spell's conditions are
already met with one hundred percent probability, it won't try to summon anyone
better, will it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Or maybe, if a perverted virgin who knew more
science had been Summoned here, that more intelligent person wouldn't have
impulsively invoked Satan.  The Emperor couldn't have been impressed by their
superior knowledge to Yugano Yuuki, since I wouldn't have been here to
establish the comparison.  So the Emperor would have been less impressed in
total, and that person's success probability would have been slightly lower.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>So that's unfortunate, but by now it's too
late to change anything… I think?  I mean, it seems futile for me to imagine
that I can change who would have been Summoned when I'm already here?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Or rather, if I was the sort of person who'd
look over this situation and refuse to ascend as Empress, then someone else
would have been Summoned instead of me.  But since now I have to decide while
already being here, am I at fault in that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Is it even possible for me to decide, when
finding myself in this situation is tantamount to already being told my
decision?  Wouldn't that be akin to trying to alter the timeline in a time
travel story where there's only one timeline, implying some disaster that
forces my story back on track?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Concepts like these make my head hurt.  I want
to say that even the knowledge of Earth didn't say anything about this, but I'm
too ignorant to say even that.  If there's a genius theory that resolves all
these issues, I don't think I can invent it on my own.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>So in the end, I'll go with what my beliefs
say when prophecies and Summonings aren't involved:  I won't refuse to help
just because someone who isn't actually here could have helped more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Once my pajamas are on, I sit on my bed and
gaze at the face of the Devil who now follows behind me.  He seems content to
say little, perhaps because chattering would be beneath his dignity.  It's
still impossible to look at his beauty without desiring it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I wonder if becoming an Empress is the least
of my worries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Hey, Satan,” I say.  “You and I need to come
to some understanding.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Amusement flickers in the ancient gaze.  “The
Devil will always bargain, though the price may not be to your liking.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Who owns whose soul, again?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The smile vanishes from his face.  “You are arrogant. 
It's not only a sin, but a flaw.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Fine, so I'm arrogant.  You're also a tad
arrogant, which is how you ended up here.  We're two arrogant people, and
you're not in the superior position.  Now, can we talk about how to make our
time together be not so unpleasant?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“I'm listening, mortal.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Angel, I'd like you to listen too.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The small winged form turns his face to me. 
“Heaven always hears you, Yugano Yuuki, even if it doesn't always answer—”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Great!  First, it's clear that the end of a
mortal lifespan doesn't change the fact of a Demon owning the mortal's soul. 
Then, am I right in guessing that after I die I'll still own the Devil's soul?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Devil doesn't say anything.  Neither does
the Angel.  I think that's answer enough.  If I <span class=0Text>wasn't </span>going
to own him forever, I believe the Devil would correct me about that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“So the Devil and Yugano Yuuki are together
for eternity, then.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Again the silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Satan, remind me to explain to you about the
Prisoner's Dilemma sometime in the next million years.  You can probably make
things unpleasant for me, but over the course of eternity I can make them more
unpleasant for you.  Alternatively, we can ask ourselves about how to make each
other's lives <span class=0Text>nicer</span>.  But that has to be both of us. 
I won't keep my hand stretched out to you if you refuse to reach back.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Devil is looking at me.  I can't read his
gaze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“We could be friends, Satan.  We could just
not do the whole thing that isn't friendly.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Still the Devil doesn't speak.  I wonder if
the mode of thought I'm suggesting is too alien to the Devil, or if he's too
old now to take another path, or if it's a rule that only mortals can change
their natures.  If I talk to this entity for long enough, will I find a person
in there besides the idea of the Devil?  Or is that idea all that there is?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I sigh, exhaling my breath.  “Satan, if you
want us to be friendlier, you might need to speak more freely.  I don't mean
that as a threat, it's just part of how friends are with each other.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>When the Devil finally speaks it's slower than
anything I've heard from him.  “Then… what would you have me say?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“For one thing, talk with me more about what's
happening.  I don't think it will hurt you to let me learn things I'm bound to
discover eventually.  Like, did you lose your rank in Hell's hierarchy from
this?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“That's impossible.  I am the Devil above the
Seven Sins.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Then, what am I to that hierarchy?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Again the Devil speaks slowly.  “You are… a
contradiction to that hierarchy.  You're worthy to be called Yugano Yuuki above
the Sin of Lust, but no more than that.  It's impossible to call you Yugano
Yuuki above the Seven Sins.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“I think I have some grasp on Sloth.  'Yugano
Yuuki above the Sin of Lust' has a fine sound to it, so I'm not a stranger to
Pride.  I can see myself having fun with Gluttony, so long as 'food that
doesn't fill your belly' translates into 'chocolate without any calories'…”  I
trail off, because the Devil doesn't look impressed.  Well, my levels there are
admittedly lower than my score in Lust.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Angel speaks.  “Yugano Yuuki, the Sins
aren't something you should try to cultivate through diligence.  They're
weaknesses in the structure of a mortal spirit, not skills.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I sigh.  “I've been thinking this for a while
without saying it… according to my own world, lust isn't a sin in the first
place.  You can do ill things in the pursuit of sexual desire, but that's
something you could say of any human motivation, including love or charity.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Angel gazes at me pityingly.  “Has it
occurred to you that your world might not be an entirely righteous one?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I look down at my hands.  I can't think of
anything to say to that.  The gap that separates my way of thinking from this
Angel's way of thinking is just too large.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I wonder if there's a view on the six other
Sins that makes them also not be evil?  The Sin of Greed… the obvious thought
to an Earth girl is 'the code of an honest capitalist who only tries to gain
wealth through trades that benefit both sides', or maybe something like
'seizing opportunities'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>But if you consider the way that the
perversion of the Internet embodies the darkest depths of Lust that this world
finds horrifying, even aspects like the desire to experience nonconsent… even
so, you blink at it and there's nothing malicious about a woman tormenting her
chaste husband with the sight of her cuckolding him, so long as everyone is
getting off.  You can sink far into the depths of the Sin as it's usually
conceived, while avoiding every bit of real harm.  If the same is true of the
other Sins, they shouldn't need to be whitewashed or made into something
abstract.  In all the parts that I do understand, this world's concept of 'sin'
seems to heavily overlap my culture's concept of 'pretty much okay'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>After a while, I shake my head.  “Leaving all
that aside, this Yugano Yuuki above the not-actually-a-sin of Lust has a
certain problem.  Devil, Angel, one of you needs to think of a way for me to
relieve the urges running through this nubile young body.  It builds up, you
know?  And thinking about how it's not allowed makes it worse.  You've got
maybe three days left before I snap, and that's if the Devil wraps himself in a
blanket and wears a paper bag over his head.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Angel has a sad look.  “Angels never
bargain, Yugano Yuuki.  I think it will be better if I stay by your side and
continue to watch over you, but only you can choose that.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Please.”  The Devil whispers the word, again
sounding like he's choking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I am so not spending my mortal lifetime this
way.  “I'm asking one of you to <span class=0Text>think of a loophole</span>.  Like,
that gold-robed mage said that I mustn't sully myself with the <span
class=0Text>touch</span> of a <span class=0Text>man</span>, so can the Devil
become a woman and do me with a cucumber?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Angel makes a horrified sound.  “That… but
that's still…”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Then how about if it's a genderless monster
with tentacles?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Yugano Yuuki, the compact requires you to be
a virgin of unsullied flesh—”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“What if the Devil does it to me in my
dreams?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Angel is huddled inside his wings.  “But…
but I'm supposed to protect your dreams from temptation…”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“You've been doing what?!  Those are <span
class=0Text>my</span> dreams and meddling in them without permission is
something that my world considers unrighteous.  Do you see my sincerity,
Angel?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Yes…”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Then will you go on constraining my dreams
after I've revoked my consent for you to do so?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“That's forbidden to me.”  The little Angel
looks worried.  “But, you're making an unwise decision, Yugano Yuuki!  The
Devil is connected to your soul.  Who knows what terrible visions he might
visit on you?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“I suppose if he visits any visions <span
class=0Text>too</span> terrible, we'll revisit that issue of protection.  But,
I can handle a fair amount of terrible.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Angel's eyes widen.  “As a virgin of the
Angels, you can't agree to—”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Agreement won't be an issue.  In my dreams,
the Devil's going to restrain me so all I can do is struggle while he, in his
form as a tentacled monstrosity, does things that even <span class=0Text>I</span>
wouldn't willingly ask for but secretly want deep down.  I'm not <span
class=0Text>agreeing</span> with the Devil doing that.  I'm just <span
class=0Text>predicting</span> what awful fate will befall me now that you're
not protecting my dreams.  Now, when this still-virgin maiden dreams helplessly
of being violated by something that's definitely not the touch of a man, is
that going to break our bond?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Angel seems frozen.  I'll take that as
approval.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>…wait, what did I just say?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Devil is chuckling darkly.  “Ah, the
creativity of a mortal soul.  I suppose it's possible that we'll get along
somewhat, Yugano Yuuki above the Sin of Lust.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I nod at the Devil.  “And will you be willing
to do what I say during the daytime, if you know that you can punish me for my
insolence at night?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“I will agree to no such bargain as a compact…
but, I might find it not too disagreeable to conduct myself in that fashion.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Seriously, what are these words coming from my
mouth?!</span></p>

<p class=Para03><span class=0Text><span lang=EN style='font-style:normal'>Well,
I'd better not let myself think about that.  I can't allow my most precious
night to be canceled </span></span><span lang=EN>again</span><span class=0Text><span
lang=EN style='font-style:normal'>.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I lie down in the bed, turning on my side so I
don't see the Devil watching, and wrapping the sheets around myself.  “There's
no way I'm going to fall asleep naturally in this state of waiting, so feel
free to invoke the powers of Sloth on me.”  I snuggle into the blankets,
resisting the temptation to press the cloth between my legs.  “And to avoid the
possibility of confusion, I'll ask this outright: Did I understand correctly
that since I'm above the Devil, I'll eventually become the supreme figure of
Hell?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“If you became more evil than I, there would
be no contradiction in the hierarchy.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>To be honest, that strikes me as…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>…incredibly awesome!  But I refrain from
saying that aloud, in case it might hurt the Devil's feelings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I wonder if owning someone's soul would
interact with romantic attraction, in either direction?  If my life is already
this messed up, I wouldn't mind going further.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Maybe I'll have gathered more information on
that possibility after tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Good night, Angel.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Angel's voice is sad again.  “I don't
think it will be.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Good night, Satan Lucifuge Asmodei Ahriman
Moloch Melkor Leviathan.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>“Good night, Yugano Yuuki.  Sweet dreams.”</span></p>
