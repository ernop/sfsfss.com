When the Abebaios block had been removed from human minds, people began to make
decisions faster, and often better. It had been the mental stutter. When it was
understood what it was, and that it had no useful function, it was removed by
simple childhood metasurgery. </span></p>

Fixico had just invented a manus module. Freddy was a Nyctalops, and the
modules were characteristic of these people. The people had then divided
themselves—according to their natures and inclinations—into the Auroreans, the
Hemerobians, and the Nyctalops; or the Dawners who had their most active hours
from 4 A.M. till Noon, the Day-Flies who obtained from Noon to 8 P.M., and the
Night-Seers whose civilization thrived from 8 P.M. to 4 A.M. The cultures,
inventions, markets, and activities of these three folk were a little
different. As a Nyctalops, Freddy had just begun his working day at 8 P.M. on a
slow Tuesday night. </span></p>

rented an office and had it furnished. This took one minute, negotiation,
selection, and installation being almost instantaneous. Then he invented the

caught on. It was an attractive module. The flow of orders began within thirty
seconds. By ten minutes after eight every important person had one of the new
manus modules, and the trend had been set. The module began to sell in the
millions. It was one of the most interesting fads of the night, or at least the
early part of the night. </span></p>

It was wonderful. All of Ildy’s marriages were. There was the wonderful
floodlighted scenery. The recirculated water of the famous falls was tinted
gold; the immediate rocks had been done by Rambles; and the hills had been
contoured by Spall. The beach was a perfect copy of that at Merevale, and the
popular drink that first part of the night was blue absinthe. </span></p>

scenery—whether seen for the first time or revisited after an interval—is
striking for the sudden intense view of it. It is not meant to be lingered
over. Food, selected and prepared instantly, is eaten with swift enjoyment: and
blue absinthe lasts no longer than its own novelty. Loving, for Ildefonsa and
her paramours, was quick and consuming; and repetition would have been
pointless to her. Besides Ildefonsa and Freddy had taken only the one-hour
luxury honeymoon. </span></p>

wished to continue the relationship, but Ildefonsa glanced at a trend
indicator. The manus module would hold its popularity for only the first third
of the night. Already it had been discarded by people who mattered. And Freddy
Fixico was not one of the regular successes. He enjoyed a full career only
about one night a week. </span></p>

assembled runners and a competent staff out of the corner of his mouth. Helpers
stripped the panhandler rags off him and wrapped him in a tycoon toga. He sent
one runner to pay back twentyfold the young couple who had advanced him a

A thoughtful man named Maxwell Mouser had just produced a work of actinic
philosophy. It took him seven minutes to write it. To write works of philosophy
one used the flexible outlines and the idea indexes; one set the activator for
such a wordage in each subsection; an adept would use the paradox feed-in, and
the striking analogy blender; one calibrated the particular-slant and the
personality-signature. It had to come out a good work, for excellence had
become the automatic minimum for such productions. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“I
will scatter a few nuts on the frosting,” said Maxwell, and he pushed the lever
for that. This sifted handfuls of words like chthonic and heuristic and
prozymeides through the thing so that nobody could doubt it was a work of
philosophy. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>Maxwell
Mouser sent the work out to publishers, and received it back each time in about
three minutes. An analysis of it and reason for rejection was always
given—mostly that the thing had been done before and better. Maxwell received
it back ten times in thirty minutes, and was discouraged. Then there was a
break. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>Ladion’s
work had become a hit within the last ten minutes, and it was now recognized
that Mouser’s monograph was both an answer and a supplement to it. It was
accepted and published in less than a minute after this break. The reviews of
the first five minutes were cautious ones; then real enthusiasm was shown. This
was truly one of the greatest works of philosophy to appear during the early
and medium hours of the night. There were those who said it might be one of the
enduring works and even have a hold-over appeal to the Dawners the next
morning. </span></p>

Maxwell Mouser and Ildefonsa Impala went honeymooning to Musicbox Mountain, a
resort. It was wonderful. The peaks were done with green snow by Dunbar and
Fittle. (Back at Money Market, Basil Bagelbaker was putting together his third
and greatest fortune of the night, which might surpass in magnitude even his
fourth fortune of the Thursday before.) The chalets were Switzier than the real
Swiss and had live goats in every room. (And Stanley Skuldugger was emerging as
the top actor-imago of the middle hours of the night.) The popular drink for
that middle part of the night was Glotzenglubber, Eve Cheese and Rhine wine
over pink ice. (And back in the city, the leading Nyctalops were taking their
midnight break at the Toppers’ Club.) </span></p>

course it was wonderful, as were all of Ildefonsa’s— But she had never been
really up on philosophy, so she had scheduled only the special thirty-five
minute honeymoon. She looked at the trend indicator to be sure. She found that
her current husband had been obsoleted, and his opus was now referred to
sneeringly as Mouser’s Mouse. They went back to the city and were divorced in

Stanley Skuldugger had become the most meteoric actor-imago for a week.
Naturally he became very rich, and Ildefonsa Impala went to see him about 3 A.M.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“I
had him first!” rang the mocking voice of Judy Skuldugger as she skipped
through her divorce in Small Claims Court. And Ildefonsa and Stanley-boy went
off honeymooning. It is always fun to finish up a period with an actor-imago
who is the hottest property in the business. There is something so adolescent
and boorish about them. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>Besides,
there was the publicity, and Ildefonsa liked that. The rumor-mills ground.
Would it last ten minutes? Thirty? An hour? Would it be one of those rare
Nyctalops marriages that lasted through the rest of the night and into the
daylight off-hours? Would it even last into the next night as some had been
known to do? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>Actually
it lasted nearly forty minutes, which was almost to the end of the period. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>It
had been a slow Tuesday night. A few hundred new products had run their course
on the markets. There had been a score of dramatic hits, three-minute and
five-minute capsule dramas, and several of the six-minute long-play affairs. <i>Night
Street Nine</i>—a solidly sordid offering—seemed to be in as the drama of the
night unless there should be a late hit. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>Hundred-storied
buildings had been erected, occupied, obsoleted, and demolished again to make
room for more contemporary structures. Only the mediocre would use a building
that had been left over from the Day-Flies or the Dawners, or even the
Nyctalops of the night before. The city was rebuilt pretty completely at least
three times during an eight-hour period. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>The
Period drew near its end. Basil Bagelbaker, the richest man in the world, the
reigning president of the Toppers’ Club, was enjoying himself with his cronies.
His fourth fortune of the night was a paper pyramid that had risen to
incredible heights; but Basil laughed to himself as he savored the manipulation
it was founded on. <br>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“Get
out of here, you dirty bum!” they told Basil savagely. They tore the tycoon’s
toga off him and then tossed him his seedy panhandler’s rags with a three-man
sneer. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“All

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“All

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“Pitch
the busted bum out!” howled Overcall and Burnbanner and the other cronies. “Wait,
Basil,” said Overcall. “Turn in the President’s Crosier before we kick you
downstairs. After all, you’ll have it several times again tomorrow night.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>The
Period was over. The Nyctalops drifted off to sleep clinics or leisure-hour
hideouts to pass their ebb time. The Auroreans, the Dawners, took over the
vital stuff. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>Now
