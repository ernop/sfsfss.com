A. Lafferty knows a lot about the history and customs of odd ethnic groups on
our planet, as he’s shown in his novel FOURTH MANSIONS and in any number of his
short stories: there are unknown peoples among us, he likes to say, who have
talents we might not expect. For instance, the people of the Travertine
islands, which float in the sky—there’s one of those islands called
Stutzamutza, and its people are worth visiting. Especially if you want to build
a 400-foot-high pagoda of pink marble. Or even if you don’t.</span></p>

deep-chested). He had only a little shoulder jacket above, and a folded drape
below. On his feet he had the</span><i><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>

Hermes-sandals, made of buckskin apparently: a silly affectation. He was darkly
burnt in skin and hair, but the roots of his hair and of his skin indicated
that he was blond in both. He was golden-bearded, but the beard (and in fact
the whole man) was covered with chalk-dust or rock-dust. The man was sweaty, and
he smelled. His was a composite smell of limestone and edged bronze and goats
and clover and honey and ozone and lentils and sour milk and dung and strong
cheese.</span></p>

this super-whiteness as a basis that makes all the other colors stand out with
such clarity. There cannot be anywhere a bluer sky than, for most of the hours

fields, where there are fields, nor more silvery water (plates IV and V). The
waterfalls are absolute rainbows, especially Final Falls, when it flows clear

these people do wonderful things with the bagpipes) and lyric harps and tabors,

limestone, marble, and dolomite for equal amounts of soil, be it the poorest
clay or sand. They filled certain crevices with this soil and got vegetation to
begin. And, in a few thousand years, they built countless verdant terraces,
knolls and valleys. Grapes, olives and clover are now grown in profusion. Wine
and oil and honey gladden the deep hearts of the people. The wonderful
blue-green clover (see plate XX) is grazed by the bees and the goats. There are
two separate species of goats, the meadow and pasture goat kept for its milk
and cheese and mohair, and the larger and wilder mountain goat hunted on the
white crags and eaten for its flavor-some randy meat. Woven mohair and dressed
buckskin are used for the Stutzamutza clothing. The people are not voluminously
clothed, in spite of the fact that it becomes quite chilly on the days when the
elevation suddenly increases.</span></p>

water on Stutzamutza is its changeableness. A lake is sometimes formed in a single
day, and it may be emptied out in one day again by mere tipping. The rain is
prodigious sometimes, when it is decided to come into that aspect. To shoot the
rapids on the sudden swollen rivers is a delight. Sometimes ice will form all
over Stutzamutza in a very few minutes. The people delight in this sudden ice,
all except the little under-equipped guest. The beauty of it is stupendous; so
is its cold. They shear the ice off in great sheets and masses and blocks, and

certain clouds preserve their identities and appear again and again; and that
some clouds are more solid than others.</p>

<p class=q>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=q style='text-indent:36.0pt'>“Later, when I took meteorology and
weather courses at the university, I had a class-mate who held a series of
seemingly insane beliefs. At the heart of these was the theory that certain
apparent clouds are not vapor masses at all but are floating stone islands in
the sky. He believed that there were some thirty of these islands, most of them
composed of limestone, but some of them of basalt, or sand-stone, even of
shale. He said that one, at least, of them was composed of pot-stone or
soap-stone.</p>

<p class=q>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=q style='text-indent:36.0pt'>“This class-mate said that these floating
islands were sometimes large, one of them being at least five miles long: that
they were intelligently navigated to follow the best camouflage, the limestone
islands usually traveling with masses of white fleecy clouds, the basalt
islands traveling with dark thunder-heads, and so on. He believed that these
islands sometimes came to rest on earth, that each of them had its own several
nests in unfrequented regions. And he believed that the floating islands were peopled.</p>

<p class=q>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=q style='text-indent:36.0pt'>“We had considerable fun with Mad Anthony
Tummley our eccentric class-mate. His ideas, we told each other, were quite
insane. And, indeed, Anthony himself was finally institutionalized. It was a
sad case, but one that could hardly be discussed without laughter.</p>

<p class=q>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=q style='text-indent:36.0pt'>“But later, after more than fifty years
in the weather profession, I have come to the conclusion that Anthony Tummley
was right in every respect. Several of us veteran weathermen share this
knowledge now, but we have developed a sort of code for the thing, not daring
to admit it openly, even to ourselves. Whales in the Sky’ is the code-name for
this study, and we pretend to keep it on a humorous basis.</p>

<p class=q>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=q style='text-indent:36.0pt'>“Some thirty of these floating stone
islands are continuously over our own country (there may be more than a hundred
of them in the world). They are tracked on radar; they are sighted again and
again in their slightly changed forms (some of them, now and then, seem to
sluff off small masses of stone and deposit it somehow on earth); they are known,
they are named.</p>

<p class=q>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=q style='text-indent:36.0pt'>“They are even visited by some persons of
odd character: always a peculiar combination of simplicity, acceptance,
intelligence and strange rapport. There are persons and families in rural
situations who employ these peopled islands to carry messages and goods for
them. In rural and swampland Louisiana, there was once some wonder that the
people did not more avail themselves of the Intercostal Canal barges to carry
their supplies, and their products to market. ‘How are the barges better than
the stone islands that we have always used?’ these people ask. ‘They aren’t on
a much more regular schedule, they aren’t much faster, and they won’t give you
anything like the same amount of service in exchange for a hundredweight of
rice. Besides that, the stone-island people are our friends, and some of them
have intermarried with us Cajuns.’ There are other regions where the same easy
cooperation obtains.</p>

<p class=q>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=q style='text-indent:36.0pt'>“Many of the stone-island people are well
known along certain almost regular routes. These people are all of a powerful
and rather coarse beauty. They are good-natured and hearty. They actually
traffic in stone, trading amazing tonnages of top grade building stone for
grain and other simple provisions.</p>

<p class=q>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=q style='text-indent:36.0pt'>“There is no scientific explanation at
all of how these things can be, how the stone islands are able to float in the
sky. But that they do so is the open secret of perhaps a million persons.</p>

<p class=q>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=q style='text-indent:36.0pt'>“Really, I am now too wealthy to be put
in a mad-house (though I made my money in a rather mad traffic which would not
be generally believed). I am too old to be laughed at openly: I will merely be

stone, all of you! Come see it in the color photography (plates I to CXXIX) if
you are not able to come yourself. This wonderful structure gives the answers
to hundreds of questions, if you will just open your eyes and your ears.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“Of ancient megalithic structures
it has sometimes been asked how a hundred or more of one hundred ton blocks of
stone could have been piled up, and fitted so carefully that even a knife-blade
could not be inserted between the blocks. It’s easy. You usually don’t set a
hundred one hundred ton blocks, unless for a certain ornamentation. You set one
ten thousand ton block, and the joinings are merely simulated. In the Pink
Pagoda I have had set blocks as heavy as three hundred thousand tons of pink
limestone (see plate XXI).</span></p>

in place. They split off what block is wanted at that location (and, believe
me, they are some splitters); then they withdraw the island a little bit and
leave the block in place.</span></p>

did I get the one hundred and fifty thousand ton main capstone in place four
hundred and fifty feet in the air? With ramps? Oh stop it, you’ll scare the
cuckoos. The stone pillars and turrets all around and below it are like
three-dimensional lace-work, and that main capstone had to go on last. It wasn’t
done by rocking it up on ramps, even if there had been a place for the ramps.
It was all done on one Saturday afternoon, and here are the sequence pictures
showing just how it was done. It was done by using a floating island, and by
detaching pieces of that island as it was floated into place. I tell you that
there is no other way that a one hundred and five pound girl can assemble a
thirty million ton Pink Pagoda in six hours. She has got to have a floating
island, with a north cliff of pink limestone, and she has got to be very good
friends with the people on that island.</span></p>
