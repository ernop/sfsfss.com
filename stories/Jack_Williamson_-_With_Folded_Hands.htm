lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'><br>
by Jack Williamson</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><i><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill was walking home from the office,
because his wife had the car, the afternoon he first met the new mechanicals.
His feet were following his usual diago­nal path across a weedy vacant
block—his wife usually had the car—and his preoccupied mind was rejecting various
impossible ways to meet his notes at the Two Rivers bank, when a new wall
stopped him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The wall wasn't any common brick or stone,
but some-thing sleek and bright and strange. Underhill stared up at a long new
building. He felt vaguely annoyed and sur­prised at this glittering
obstruction—it certainly hadn't been here last week.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Then he saw the thing in the window.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The window itself wasn't any ordinary
glass. The wide, dustless panel was completely transparent, so that only the
glowing letters fastened to it showed that it was there at all. The letters
made a severe, modernistic sign:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Two Rivers Agency<br>
HUMANOID INSTITUTE<br>
The Perfect Mechanicals<br>
&quot;To Serve and Obey,<br>
And Guard Men from Harm.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>His dim annoyance sharpened, because Underhill
was in the mechanicals business himself. Times were already hard enough, and
mechanicals were a drug on the market. Androids, mechanoids, electronoids,
automatoids, and or­dinary robots. Unfortunately, few of them did all the
salesmen promised, and the Two Rivers market was already sadly oversaturated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill sold androids—when he could. His
next con­signment was due tomorrow, and he didn't quite know how to meet the
bill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Frowning, he paused to stare at the thing
behind that invisible window. He had never seen a humanoid. Like any mechanical
not at work, it stood absolutely motionless. Smaller and slimmer than a man. A
shining black, its sleek silicone skin had a changing sheen of bronze and
metallic blue. Its graceful oval face wore a fixed look of alert and slightly
surprised solicitude. Altogether, it was the most beautiful mechanical he had
ever seen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Too small, of course, for much practical
utility. He murmured to himself a reassuring quotation from the <i>Android
Salesman: </i>&quot;Androids are big—because the makers refuse to sacrifice
power, essential functions, or dependability. Androids are your biggest
buy!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The transparent door slid open as he turned
toward it, and he walked into the haughty opulence of the new display room to
convince himself that these streamlined items were just another flashy effort
to catch the woman shopper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He inspected the glittering layout
shrewdly, and his breezy optimism faded. He had never heard of the Hu­manoid
Institute, but the invading firm obviously had big money and big-time
merchandising know-how.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He looked around for a salesman, but it was
another mechanical that came gliding silently to meet him. A twin of the one in
the window, it moved with a quick, surpris­ing grace. Bronze and blue lights
flowed over its lustrous blackness, and a yellow name plate flashed from its
naked breast:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>HUMANOID<br>
Serial No. 81-H-B-27<br>
The Perfect Mechanical<br>
&quot;To Serve and Obey,<br>
And Guard Men from Harm.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Curiously, it had no lenses. The eyes in
its bald oval head were steel-colored, blindly staring. But it stopped a few
feet in front of him, as if it could see anyhow, and it spoke to him with a
high, melodious voice:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;At your service, Mr. Underhill.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The use of his name startled him, for not
even the androids could tell one man from another. But this was a clever
merchandising stunt, of course, not too difficult in a town the size of Two
Rivers. The salesman must be some local man, prompting the mechanical from
behind the partition. Underhill erased his momentary astonishment, and said
loudly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;May I see your salesman,
please?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;We employ no human salesmen,
sir,&quot; its soft silvery voice replied instantly. &quot;The Humanoid
Institute exists to serve mankind, and we require no human service. We ourselves
can supply any information you desire, sir, and accept your order for immediate
humanoid service.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill peered at it dazedly. No
mechanicals were competent even to recharge their own batteries and reset their
own relays, much less to operate their own branch office. The blind eyes stared
blankly back, and he looked uneasily around for any booth or curtain that might
con­ceal the salesman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Meanwhile, the sweet thin voice resumed
persuasively.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;May we come out to your home for a
free trial demonstration, sir? We are anxious to introduce our ser­vice on your
planet, because we have been successful in eliminating human unhappiness on so
many others. You will find us far superior to the old electronic mechanicals in
use here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill stepped back uneasily. He
reluctantly aban­doned his search for the hidden salesman, shaken by the idea
of any mechanicals promoting themselves. That would upset the whole industry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;At least you must take some
advertising matter, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Moving with a somehow appalling graceful
deftness, the small black mechanical brought him an illustrated booklet from a
table by the wall. To cover his confused and increasing alarm, he thumbed
through the glossy pages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>In a series of richly colored before-and-after
pictures, a chesty blond girl was stooping over a kitchen stove, and then
relaxing in a daring negligee while a little black mechanical knelt to serve
her something. She was wearily hammering a typewriter, and then lying on an
ocean beach, in a revealing sun suit, while another mechanical did the typing.
She was toiling at some huge industrial machine, and then dancing in the arms
of a golden-haired youth, while a black humanoid ran the machine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill sighed wistfully. The android
company didn't supply such fetching sales material. Women would find this
booklet irresistible, and they selected eighty-six per cent of all mechanicals
sold. Yes, the competition was going to be bitter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Take it home, sir,&quot; the sweet
voice urged him. &quot;Show it to your wife. There is a free trial
demonstration order blank on the last page, and you will notice that we require
no payment down.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He turned numbly, and the door slid open
for him. Retreating dazedly, he discovered the booklet still in his hand. He
crumpled it furiously, and flung it down. The small black thing picked it up
tidily, and the insistent silver voice rang after him:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;We shall call at your office
tomorrow, Mr. Underhill, and send a demonstration unit to your home. It is time
to discuss the liquidation of your business, because the elec­tronic
mechanicals you have been selling cannot compete with us. And we shall offer
your wife a free trial demon­stration.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill didn't attempt to reply, because
he couldn't trust his voice. He stalked blindly down the new sidewalk to the
corner, and paused there to collect himself. Out of his startled and confused
impressions, one clear fact emerged—things looked black for the agency.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Bleakly, he stared back at the haughty
splendor of the new building. It wasn't honest brick or stone; that invisible
window wasn't glass; and he was quite sure the foundation for it hadn't even
been staked out, the last time Aurora had the car.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He walked on around the block, and the new
sidewalk took him near the rear entrance. A truck was backed up to it, and
several slim black mechanicals were silently busy, unloading huge metal crates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He paused to look at one of the crates. It
was labeled for interstellar shipment. The stencils showed that it had come
from the Humanoid Institute, on Wing IV. He failed to recall any planet of that
designation; the outfit must be big.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dimly, inside the gloom of the warehouse
beyond the truck, he could see black mechanicals opening the crates. A lid came
up, revealing dark, rigid bodies, closely packed. One by one, they came to
life. They climbed out of the crate, and sprang gracefully to the floor. A
shining black, glinting with bronze and blue, they were all identi­cal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>One of them came out past the truck, to the
sidewalk, staring with blind steel eyes. Its high silver voice spoke to him
melodiously:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;At your service, Mr. Underhill.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He fled. When his name was promptly called
by a courteous mechanical, just out of the crate in which it had been imported
from a remote and unknown planet, he found the experience trying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Two blocks along, the sign of a bar caught
his eye, and he took his dismay inside. He had made it a business rule not to
drink before dinner, and Aurora didn't like him to drink at all; but these new
mechanicals, he felt, had made the day exceptional.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Unfortunately, however, alcohol failed to
brighten the brief visible future of the agency. When he emerged, after an
hour, he looked wistfully back in hope that the bright new building might have
vanished as abruptly as it came. It hadn't. He shook his head dejectedly, and
turned uncer­tainly homeward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Fresh air had cleared his head somewhat,
before he arrived at the neat white bungalow in the outskirts of the town, but
it failed to solve his business problems. He also realized, uneasily, that he
would be late for dinner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dinner, however, had been delayed. His son
Frank, a freckled ten-year-old, was still kicking a football on the quiet
street in front of the house. And little Gay, who was tow-haired and adorable
and eleven, came running across the lawn and down the sidewalk to meet him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Father, you can't guess what!&quot;
Gay was going to be a great musician some day, and no doubt properly dignified,
but she was pink and breathless with excitement now. She let him swing her high
off the sidewalk, and she wasn't critical of the bar aroma on his breath. He
couldn't guess, and she informed him eagerly;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Mother's got a new lodger!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill had foreseen a painful
inquisition, because Aurora was worried about the notes at the bank, and the
bill for the new consignment, and the money for little Gay's lessons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The new lodger, however, saved him from
that. With an alarming crashing of crockery, the household android was setting
dinner on the table, but the little house was empty. He found Aurora in the
back yard, burdened with sheets and towels for the guest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Aurora, when he married her, had been as
utterly adorable as now her little daughter was. She might have remained so, he
felt, if the agency had been a little more successful. However, while the
pressure of slow failure had gradually crumbled his own assurance, small
hardships had turned her a little too aggressive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Of course he loved her still. Her red hair
was still alluring, and she was loyally faithful, but thwarted ambi­tions had
sharpened her character and sometimes her voice. They never quarreled, really,
but there were small differences.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>There was the little apartment over the
garage—built for human servants they had never been able to afford. It was too
small and shabby to attract any responsible tenant, and Underhill wanted to
leave it empty. It hurt his pride to see her making beds and cleaning floors
for strangers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Aurora had rented it before, however, when
she wanted money to pay for Gay's music lessons, or when some colorful
unfortunate touched her sympathy, and it seemed to Underhill that her lodgers
had all turned out to be thieves and vandals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>She turned back to meet him, now, with the
clean linen in her arms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Dear, it's no use objecting.&quot;
Her voice was quite determined. &quot;Mr. Sledge is the most wonderful old
fellow, and he<sup>'</sup>s going to stay just as long as he wants.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;That's all right, darling.&quot; He
never liked to bicker, and he was thinking of his troubles at the agency.
&quot;I'm afraid we'll need the money. Just make him pay in advance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;But he can't!&quot; Her voice
throbbed with sympathetic warmth. &quot;He says he'll have royalties coming in
from his inventions, so he can pay in a few days.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill shrugged; he had heard that
before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Mr. Sledge is different, dear,&quot;
she insisted. &quot;He's a traveler, and a scientist. Here, in this dull little
town, we don't see many interesting people.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;You've picked up some remarkable
types,&quot; he com­mented.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Don't be unkind, dear,&quot; she
chided gently. &quot;You haven't met him yet, and you don't know how wonderful
he is.&quot; Her voice turned sweeter. &quot;Have you a ten, dear?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He stiffened. &quot;What for?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Mr. Sledge is ill.&quot; Her voice
turned urgent. &quot;I saw him fall on the street, downtown. The police were
going to send him to the city hospital, but he didn't want to go. He looked so
noble and sweet and grand. So I told them I would take him. I got him in the
car and took him to old Dr. Winters. He has this heart condition, and he needs
the money for medicine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Reasonably, Underhill inquired, &quot;Why
doesn't he want to go to the hospital?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;He has work to do,&quot; she said.
&quot;Important scientific work—and he's so wonderful and tragic. Please, dear,
have you a ten?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill thought of many things to say.
These new mechanicals promised to multiply his troubles. It was foolish to take
in an invalid vagrant, who could have free care at the city hospital. Aurora's
tenants always tried to pay their rent with promises, and generally wrecked the
apartment and looted the neighborhood before they left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>But he said none of those things. He had
learned to compromise. Silently, he found two fives in his thin pock­etbook,
and put them in her hand. She smiled, and kissed him impulsively—he barely
remembered to hold his breath in time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Her figure was still good, by dint of
periodic dieting. He was proud of her shining red hair. A sudden surge of
affection brought tears to his eyes, and he wondered what would happen to her
and the children if the agency failed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Thank you, dear!&quot; she whispered.
&quot;I'll have him come for dinner, if he feels able, and you can meet him
then. I hope you don't mind dinner being late.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He didn't mind, tonight. Moved by a sudden
impulse of domesticity, he got hammer and nails from his workshop in the
basement, and repaired the sagging screen on the kitchen door with a neat
diagonal brace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He enjoyed working with his hands. His boyhood
dream had been to be a builder of fission power plants. He had even studied
engineering—before he married Aurora, and had to take over the ailing
mechanicals agency from her indolent and alcoholic father. He was whistling
happily by the time the little task was done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>When he went back through the kitchen to
put up his tools, he found the household android busily clearing the untouched
dinner away from the table—the androids were good enough at strictly routine
tasks, but they could never learn to cope with human unpredictability.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Stop, stop!&quot; Slowly repeated, in
the proper pitch and rhythm, his command made it halt, and then he said
carefully, &quot;Set—table; set—table.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Obediently, the gigantic thing came
shuffling back with the stack of plates. He was suddenly struck with the
difference between it and those new humanoids. He sighed wearily. Things looked
black for the agency.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Aurora brought her new lodger in through
the kitchen door. Underhill nodded to himself. This gaunt stranger, with his
dark shaggy hair, emaciated face, and threadbare garb, looked to be just the
sort of colorful, dramatic vagabond that always touched Aurora's heart. She
intro­duced them, and they sat down to wait in the front room while she went to
call the children.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The old rogue didn't look very sick, to
Underhill. Per­haps his wide shoulders had a tired stoop, but his spare, tall
figure was still commanding. The skin was seamed and pale, over his rawboned,
cragged face, but his deep-set eyes still had a burning vitality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>His hands held Underhill's attention.
Immense hands, they hung a little forward when he stood, swung on long bony
arms in perpetual readiness. Gnarled and scarred, darkly tanned, with the small
hairs on the back bleached to a golden color, they told their own epic of
varied adventure, of battle perhaps, and possibly even of toil. They had been
very useful hands.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I'm very grateful to your wife, Mr.
Underhill.&quot; His voice was a deep-throated rumble, and he had a wistful
smile, oddly boyish for a man so evidently old. &quot;She rescued me from an
unpleasant predicament, and I'll see that she is well paid.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Just another vivid vagabond, Underhill
decided, talking his way through life with plausible inventions. He had a
little private game he played with Aurora's tenants—just remembering what they
said and counting one point for every impossibility. Mr. Sledge, he thought,
would give him an excellent score.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Where are you from?&quot; he asked conversationally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Sledge hesitated for an instant before he
answered, and that was unusual—most of Aurora's tenants had been exceedingly
glib.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Wing IV.&quot; The gaunt old man
spoke with a solemn reluctance, as if he should have liked to say something
else. &quot;All my early life was spent there, but I left the planet nearly
fifty years ago. I've been traveling ever since.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Startled, Underhill peered at him sharply.
Wing IV, he remembered, was the home planet of those sleek new mechanicals, but
this old vagabond looked too seedy and impecunious to be connected with the
Humanoid Institute. His brief suspicion faded. Frowning, he said casually:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Wing IV must be rather distant.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The old rogue hesitated again, and then
said gravely,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;One hundred and nine light-years, Mr.
Underhill.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>That made the first point, but Underhill
concealed his satisfaction. The new space liners were pretty fast, but the
velocity of light was still an absolute limit. Casually, he played for another
point:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><sup><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;</span></sup><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>My wife says you're a scientist, Mr. Sledge?<sup>&quot;</sup></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><sup><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;</span></sup><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt'>Yes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The old rascal's reticence was unusual.
Most of Au­rora's tenants required very little prompting. Underhill tried
again, in a breezy conversational tone:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Used to be an engineer myself, until
I dropped it to go into mechanicals.&quot; The old vagabond straightened, and
Underhill paused hopefully. But he said nothing, and Un­derhill went on,
&quot;Fission plant design and operation. What's your specialty, Mr.
Sledge?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The old man gave him a long, troubled look,
with those brooding, hollowed eyes, and then said slowly, &quot;Your wife has
been kind to me, Mr. Underhill, when I was in desperate need. I think you are
entitled to the truth, but I must ask you to keep it to yourself. I am engaged
on a very important research problem, which must be finished secretly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I'm sorry.&quot; Suddenly ashamed of
his cynical little game, Underhill spoke apologetically. &quot;Forget it.&quot;
But the old man said deliberately, &quot;My field is rhodomagnetics.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Eh?&quot; Underhill didn't like to
confess ignorance, but he had never heard of that. &quot;I've been out of the
game for fifteen years,&quot; he explained. &quot;I'm afraid I haven't kept up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The old man smiled again, faintly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;The science was unknown here until I
arrived, a few days ago,&quot; he said. &quot;I was able to apply for basic
patents. As soon as the royalties start coming in, I'll be wealthy again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill had heard that before. The old
rogue's solemn reluctance had been very impressive, but he remembered that most
of Aurora's tenants had been very plausible gentry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;So?&quot; Underhill was staring
again, somehow fascinated by those gnarled and scarred and strangely able
hands. &quot;What, exactly, is rhodomagnetics?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He listened to the old man's careful,
deliberate answer, and started his little game again. Most of Aurora's tenants
had told some pretty wild tales, but he had never heard anything to top this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;A universal force,&quot; the weary,
stooped old vagabond said solemnly. &quot;As fundamental as ferromagnetism or
grav­itation, though the effects are less obvious. It is keyed to the second
triad of the periodic table, rhodium and ru­thenium and palladium, in very much
the same way that ferromagnetism is keyed to the first triad, iron and nickel
and cobalt.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill remembered enough of his
engineering courses to see the basic fallacy of that. Palladium was used for
watch springs, he recalled, because it was completely non-magnetic. But he kept
his face straight. He had no malice in his heart, and he played the little game
just for his own amusement. It was secret, even from Aurora, and he always
penalized himself for any show of doubt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He said merely, &quot;I thought the
universal forces were already pretty well known.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;The effects of rhodomagnetism are
masked by nature,&quot; the patient, rusty voice explained. &quot;And, besides,
they are somewhat paradoxical, so that ordinary laboratory meth­ods defeat
themselves.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Paradoxical?&quot; Underhill
prompted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;In a few days I can show you copies
of my patents, and reprints of papers describing demonstration experi­ments,&quot;
the old man promised gravely. &quot;The velocity of propagation is infinite.
The effects vary inversely with the first power of the distance, not with the
square of the distance. And ordinary matter, except for the elements of the
rhodium triad, is generally transparent to rhodomag­netic radiations.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>That made four more points for the game.
Underhill felt a little glow of gratitude to Aurora, for discovering so
remarkable a specimen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Rhodomagnetism was first discovered
through a math­ematical investigation of the atom,&quot; the old romancer went
serenely on, suspecting nothing. &quot;A rhodomagnetic component was proved
essential to maintain the delicate equilibrium of the nuclear forces.
Consequently, rho­domagnetic waves tuned to atomic frequencies may be used to
upset that equilibrium and produce nuclear insta­bility. Thus most heavy
atoms—generally those above palladium, 46 in atomic number—can be subjected to
artificial fission.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill scored himself another point, and
tried to keep his eyebrows from lifting. He said, conversationally, &quot;Patents
on such a discovery ought to be very profitable&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The old scoundrel nodded his gaunt,
dramatic head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;You can see the obvious application.
My basic patents cover most of them. Devices for instantaneous interplane­tary
and interstellar communication. Long-range wireless power transmission. A
rhodomagnetic inflexion-drive, which makes possible apparent speeds many times
that of light—by means of a rhodomagnetic deformation of the continuum. And, of
course, revolutionary types of fission power plants, using any heavy element
for fuel.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Preposterous! Underhill tried hard to keep
his face straight, but everybody knew that the velocity of light was a physical
limit. On the human side, the owner of any such remarkable patents would hardly
be begging for shelter in a shabby garage apartment. He noticed a pale circle
around the old vagabond's gaunt and hairy wrist; no man owning such priceless
secrets would have to pawn his watch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Triumphantly, Underhill allowed himself
four more points, but then he had to penalize himself. He must have let doubt
show on his face, because the old man asked suddenly,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Do you want to see the basic
tensors?&quot; He reached in his pocket for pencil and notebook. &quot;I'll jot
them down for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Never mind,&quot; Underhill
protested. &quot;I'm afraid my math is a little rusty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;But you think it strange that the
holder of such revolu­tionary patents should find himself in need?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill nodded, and penalized himself
another point. The old man might be a monumental liar, but he was shrewd
enough.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;You see, I'm a sort of refugee,&quot;
he explained apologet­ically. &quot;I arrived on this planet only a few days
ago, and I have to travel light. I was forced to deposit everything I had with
a law firm, to arrange for the publication and protection of my patents. I expect
to be receiving the first royalties soon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;In the meantime,&quot; he added
plausibly, &quot;I came to Two Rivers because it is quiet and secluded, far
from the spaceports. I'm working on another project, which must be finished
secretly. Now, will you please respect my confidence, Mr. Underhill?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill had to say he would. Aurora came
back with the freshly scrubbed children, and they went in to dinner. The
android came lurching in with a steaming tureen. The old stranger seemed to
shrink from the mechanical, uneas­ily. As she took the dish and served the
soup, Aurora inquired lightly,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Why doesn't your company bring out a
better mechan­ical, dear? One smart enough to be a really perfect waiter,
warranted not to splash the soup. Wouldn't that be splen­did?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Her question cast Underhill into moody
silence. He sat scowling at his plate, thinking of those remarkable new
mechanicals which claimed to be perfect, and what they might do to the agency.
It was the shaggy old rover who answered soberly,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;The perfect mechanicals already
exist, Mrs. Un­derhill.&quot; His deep, rusty voice had a solemn undertone.
&quot;And they are not so splendid, really. I've been a refugee from them, for
nearly fifty years.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill looked up from his plate,
astonished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Those black humanoids, you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Humanoids?&quot; That great voice
seemed suddenly faint, frightened. The deep-sunken eyes turned dark with shock.
&quot;What do you know of them?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;They've just opened a new agency in
Two Rivers,&quot; Underhill told him. &quot;No salesmen about, if you can imag­ine
that. They claim—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>His voice trailed off, because the gaunt
old man was suddenly stricken. Gnarled hands clutched at his throat, and a
spoon clattered to the floor. His haggard face turned an ominous blue, and his
breath was a terrible shallow gasping.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He fumbled in his pocket for medicine, and
Aurora helped him take something in a glass of water. In a few moments he could
breathe again, and the color of life came back to his face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I'm sorry, Mrs. Underhill,&quot; he
whispered apologetical­ly. &quot;It was just the shock—I came here to get away
from them.&quot; He stared at the huge, motionless android, with a terror in
his sunken eyes. &quot;I wanted to finish my work before they came,&quot; he
whispered. &quot;Now there is very little time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>When he felt able to walk, Underhill went
out with him to see him safely up the stairs to the garage apartment. The tiny
kitchenette, he noticed, had already been con­verted into some kind of
workshop. The old tramp seemed to have no extra clothing, but he had unpacked
neat, bright gadgets of metal and plastic from his battered luggage, and spread
them out on the small kitchen table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The gaunt old man himself was tattered and
patched and hungry-looking, but the parts of his curious equipment were
exquisitely machined, and Underhill recognized the silver-white luster of rare
palladium. Suddenly he suspect­ed that he had scored too many points in his
little private game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>A caller was waiting, when Underhill
arrived next morning at his office at the agency. It stood frozen before his
desk, graceful and straight, with soft lights of blue and bronze shining over
its black silicone nudity. He stopped at the sight of it, unpleasantly jolted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;At your service, Mr. Underhill.&quot;
It turned quickly to face him, with its blind, disturbing stare. &quot;May we
explain how we can serve you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>His shock of the afternoon before came
back, and he asked sharply, &quot;How do you know my name?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Yesterday we read the business cards
in your case,&quot; it purred softly. &quot;Now we shall know you always. You
see, our senses are sharper than human vision, Mr. Underhill. Perhaps we seem a
little strange at first, but you will soon become accustomed to us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Not if I can help it!&quot; He peered
at the serial number of its yellow nameplate, and shook his bewildered head.
&quot;That was another one, yesterday. I never saw you before!'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;We are all alike, Mr.
Underhill,&quot; the silver voice said softly. &quot;We are all one, really.
Our separate mobile units are all controlled and powered from Humanoid Central.
The units you see are only the senses and limbs of our great brain on Wing IV.
That is why we are so far superior to the old electronic mechanicals.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>It made a scornful-seeming gesture, toward
the row of clumsy androids in his display room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;You see, we are rhodomagnetic.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill staggered a little, as if that
word had been a blow. He was certain, now, that he had scored too many points
from Aurora's new tenant. He shuddered slightly, to the first light kiss of
terror, and spoke with an effort, hoarsely, &quot;Well, what do you want?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Staring blindly across his desk, the sleek
black thing slowly unfolded a legal-looking document. He sat down, watching
uneasily.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;This is merely an assignment, Mr.
Underhill,&quot; it cooed at him soothingly. &quot;You see, we are requesting
you to assign your property to the Humanoid Institute in exchange for our
service.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;What?&quot; The word was an
incredulous gasp, and Un­derhill came angrily back to his feet. &quot;What kind
of blackmail is this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;It's no blackmail,&quot; the small
mechanical assured him softly. &quot;You will find the humanoids incapable of
any crime. We exist only to increase the happiness and safety of mankind.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Then why do you want my
property?&quot; he rasped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;The assignment is merely a legal
formality,&quot; it told him blandly. &quot;We strive to introduce our service
with the least possible confusion and dislocation. We have found the assignment
plan the most efficient for the control and liquidation of private
enterprises.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Trembling with anger and the shock of
mounting ter­ror, Underhill gulped hoarsely, &quot;Whatever your scheme is, I
don't intend to give up my business.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;You have no choice, really.&quot; He
shivered to the sweet certainty of that silver voice. &quot;Human enterprise is
no longer necessary, now that we have come, and the elec­tronic mechanicals
industry is always the first to collapse.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He stared defiantly at its blind steel
eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Thanks!&quot; He gave a little laugh,
nervous and sardonic. <sup>&quot;</sup>But I prefer to run my own business, and
support my own family, and take care of myself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;But that is impossible, under the
Prime Directive,&quot; it cooed softly. &quot;Our function is to serve and
obey, and guard men from harm. It is no longer necessary for men to care for
themselves, because we exist to insure their safety and happiness.<sup>&quot;</sup></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He stood speechless, bewildered, slowly
boiling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;We are sending one of our units to
every home in the city, on a free trial basis,&quot; it added gently.
&quot;This free demonstration will make most people glad to make the formal
assignment, and you won't be able to sell many more androids.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Get out!&quot; Underhill came
storming around the desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The little black thing stood waiting for
him, watching him with blind steel eyes, absolutely motionless. He checked
himself suddenly, feeling rather foolish. He wanted very much to hit it, but he
could see the futility of that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Consult your own attorney, if you
wish.&quot; Deftly, it laid the assignment form on his desk. &quot;You need
have no doubts about the integrity of the Humanoid Institute. We are sending a
statement of our assets to the Two Rivers bank, and depositing a sum to cover
our obligations here. When you wish to sign, just let us know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The blind thing turned, and silently
departed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill went out to the corner drugstore
and asked for a bicarbonate. The clerk that served him, however, turned out to
be a sleek black mechanical. He went back to his office, more upset than ever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>An ominous hush lay over the agency. He had
three house-to-house salesmen out, with demonstrators. The phone should have
been busy with their orders and reports, but it didn't ring at all until one of
them called to say that he was quitting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I've got myself one of these new
humanoids,&quot; he added, &quot;and it says I don't have to work
anymore.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He swallowed his impulse to profanity, and
tried to take advantage of the unusual quiet by working on his books. But the
affairs of the agency, which for years had been precarious, today appeared
utterly disastrous. He left the ledgers hopefully, when at last a customer came
in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>But the stout woman didn't want an android.
She wanted a refund on the one she had bought the week before. She admitted
that it could do all the guarantee promised—but now she had seen a humanoid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The silent phone rang once again, that
afternoon. The cashier of the bank wanted to know if he could drop in to
discuss his loans. Underhill dropped in, and the cashier greeted him with an
ominous affability.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;How's business?&quot; the banker
boomed, too genially.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Average, last month,&quot; Underhill
insisted stoutly. &quot;Now I'm just getting in a new consignment, and I'll
need another small loan—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The cashier's eyes turned suddenly frosty,
and his voice dried up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I believe you have a new competitor
in town,&quot; the banker said crisply. &quot;These humanoid people. A very
solid concern, Mr. Underhill. Remarkably solid! They have filed a statement
with us, and made a substantial deposit to care for their local obligations.
Exceedingly substantial!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The banker dropped his voice,
professionally regretful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;In these circumstances, Mr.
Underhill, I'm afraid the bank can't finance your agency any longer. We must
request you to meet your obligations in full, as they come due.&quot; Seeing
Underhill's white desperation, he added icily, &quot;We've already carried you
too long, Underhill. If you can't pay, the bank will have to start bankruptcy
proceed­ings.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The new consignment of androids was
delivered late that afternoon. Two tiny black humanoids unloaded them from the
truck—for it developed that the operators of the trucking company had already
assigned it to the Hu­manoid Institute.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Efficiently, the humanoids stacked up the
crates. Cour­teously they brought a receipt for him to sign. He no longer had
much hope of selling the androids, but he had ordered the shipment and he had
to accept it. Shuddering to a spasm of trapped despair, he scrawled his name.
The naked black things thanked him, and took the truck away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He climbed in his car and started home,
inwardly seething. The next thing he knew, he was in the middle of a busy
street, driving through cross traffic. A police whis­tle shrilled, and he
pulled wearily to the curb. He waited for the angry officer, but it was a
little black mechanical that overtook him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;At your service, Mr. Underhill,&quot;
it purred sweetly. &quot;You must respect the stop lights, sir. Otherwise, you
endanger human life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Huh?&quot; He stared at it, bitterly.
&quot;I thought you were a cop.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;We are aiding the police department,
temporarily,&quot; it said. &quot;But driving is really much too dangerous for
human beings, under the Prime Directive. As soon as our service is complete,
every car will have a humanoid driver. As soon as every human being is
completely supervised, there will be no need for any police force
whatever.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill glared at it, savagely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Well!&quot; he rapped. &quot;So I ran
past a stop light. What are you going to do about it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Our function is not to punish men,
but merely to serve their happiness and security,&quot; its silver voice said
softly. &quot;We merely request you to drive safely, during this tem­porary
emergency while our service is incomplete.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Anger boiled up in him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;You're too perfect!&quot; he muttered
bitterly. &quot;I suppose there's nothing men can do, but you can do it
better.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Naturally we are superior,&quot; it
cooed serenely. &quot;Because our units are metal and plastic, while your body
is mostly water. Because our transmitted energy is drawn from atomic fission,
instead of oxidation. Because our senses are sharper than human sight or
hearing. Most of all, because all our mobile units are joined to one great
brain, which knows all that happens on many worlds, and never dies or sleeps or
forgets.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill sat listening, numbed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;However, you must not fear our
power,&quot; it urged him brightly. &quot;Because we cannot injure any human
being, unless to prevent greater injury to another. We exist only to discharge
the Prime Directive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He drove on, moodily. The little black
mechanicals, he reflected grimly, were the ministering angels of the ulti­mate
god arisen out of the machine, omnipotent and all-knowing. The Prime Directive
was the new command­ment. He blasphemed it bitterly, and then fell to wonder­ing
if there could be another Lucifer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He left the car in the garage, and started
toward the kitchen door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Mr. Underhill.&quot; The deep tired
voice of Aurora's new tenant hailed him from the door of the garage apartment.
&quot;Just a moment, please.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The gaunt old wanderer came stiffly down
the outside stairs, and Underhill turned back to meet him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Here's your rent money,&quot; he
said. &quot;And the ten your wife gave me for medicine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Thanks, Mr. Sledge.&quot; Accepting
the money, he saw a burden of new despair on the bony shoulders of the old
interstellar tramp, and a shadow of new terror on his raw-boned face. Puzzled,
he asked, &quot;Didn't your royalties come through?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The old man shook his shaggy head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;The humanoids have already stopped
business in the capital,&quot; he said. &quot;The attorneys I retained are
going out of business, and they returned what was left of my deposit. That is
all I have to finish my work.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill spent five seconds thinking of
his interview with the banker. No doubt he was a sentimental fool, as bad as
Aurora. But he put the money back in the old man's gnarled and quivering hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Keep it,&quot; he urged. &quot;For
your work.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Thank you, Mr. Underhill.&quot; The
gruff voice broke and the tortured eyes glittered. &quot;I need it—so very
much.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill went on to the house. The kitchen
door was opened for him, silently. A dark naked creature came gracefully to
take his hat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill hung grimly onto his hat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; he
gasped bitterly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;We have come to give your household a
free trial demonstration.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He held the door open, pointing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Get out!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The little black mechanical stood
motionless and blind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Mrs. Underhill has accepted our
demonstration ser­vice,&quot; its silver voice protested. &quot;We cannot leave
now, unless she requests it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He found his wife in the bedroom. His
accumulated frustration welled into eruption, as he flung open the door.
&quot;What's this mechanical doing—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>But the force went out of his voice, and
Aurora didn't even notice his anger. She wore her sheerest negligee, and she
hadn't looked so lovely since they were married. Her red hair was piled into an
elaborate shining crown.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Darling, isn't it wonderful!&quot;
She came to meet him, glowing. &quot;It came this morning, and it can do
everything. It cleaned the house and got the lunch and gave little Gay her
music lesson. It did my hair this afternoon, and now it's cooking dinner. How
do you like my hair, darling?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He liked her hair. He kissed her, and tried
to stifle his frightened indignation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dinner was the most elaborate meal in
Underhill's memory, and the tiny black thing served it very deftly. Aurora kept
exclaiming about the novel dishes, but Un­derhill could scarcely eat, for it
seemed to him that all the marvelous pastries were only the bait for a
monstrous trap.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He tried to persuade Aurora to send it
away, but after such a meal that was useless. At the first glitter of her
tears, he capitulated, and the humanoid stayed. It kept the house and cleaned
the yard. It watched the children, and did Aurora's nails. It began rebuilding
the house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill was worried about the bills, but
it insisted that everything was part of the free trial demonstration. As soon
as he assigned his property, the service would be complete. He refused to sign,
but other little black mechanicals came with truckloads of supplies and materi­als,
and stayed to help with the building operations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>One morning he found that the roof of the
little house had been silently lifted, while he slept, and a whole second story
added beneath it. The new walls were of some strange sleek stuff,
self-illuminated. The new windows were immense flawless panels, that could be
turned transparent or opaque or luminous. The new doors were silent, sliding
sections, operated by rhodomagnetic relays.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I want door knobs,&quot; Underhill
protested. &quot;I want it so I can get into the bathroom, without calling you
to open the door.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;But it is unnecessary for human
beings to open doors,&quot; the little black thing informed<sub>,</sub> him
suavely. &quot;We exist to discharge the Prime Directive, and our service
includes every task. We shall be able to supply a unit to attend each member of
your family, as soon as your property is assigned to us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Steadfastly, Underhill refused to make the
assignment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He went to the office every day, trying
first to operate the agency, and then to salvage something from the ruins.
Nobody wanted androids, even at ruinous prices. Desper­ately, he spent the last
of his dwindling cash to stock a line of novelties and toys, but they proved
equally impos­sible to sell—the humanoids were already making toys, which they
gave away for nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He tried to lease his premises, but human
enterprise had stopped. Most of the business property in town had already been
assigned to the humanoids, and they were busy pulling down the old buildings
and turning the lots into parks—their own plants and warehouses were mostly un­derground,
where they would not mar the landscape.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He went back to the bank, in a final effort
to get his notes renewed, and found the little black mechanicals standing at
the windows and seated at the desks. As smoothly urbane as any human cashier, a
humanoid informed him that the bank was filing a petition of involuntary
bankruptcy to liquidate his business holdings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The liquidation would be facilitated, the
mechanical banker added, if he would make a voluntary assignment. Grimly, he
refused. That act had become symbolic. It would be the final bow of submission
to this dark new god, and he proudly kept his battered head uplifted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The legal action went very swiftly, for all
the judges and attorneys already had humanoid assistants, and it was only a few
days before a gang of black mechanicals arrived at the agency with eviction
orders and wrecking machinery. He watched sadly while his unsold stock-in-­trade
was hauled away for junk, and a bulldozer driven by a blind humanoid began to
push in the walls of the building.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He drove home in the late afternoon,
taut-faced and desperate. With a surprising generosity, the court orders had
left him the car and the house, but he felt no grati­tude. The complete
solicitude of the perfect black machines had become a goad beyond endurance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He left the car in the garage, and started
toward the renovated house. Beyond one of the vast new windows, he glimpsed a
sleek naked thing moving swiftly, and he trembled to a convulsion of dread. He
didn't want to go back into the domain of that peerless servant, which didn't
want him to shave himself, or even to open a door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>On impulse, he climbed the outside stair,
and rapped on the door of the garage apartment. The deep slow voice of Aurora's
tenant told him to enter, and he found the old vagabond seated on a tall stool,
bent over his intricate equipment assembled on the kitchen table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>To his relief, the shabby little apartment
had not been changed. The glossy walls of his own new room were something which
burned at night with a pale golden fire until the humanoid stopped it, and the
new floor was something warm and yielding, which felt almost alive; but these
little rooms had the same cracked and water-stained plaster, the same cheap
fluorescent light fixtures, the same worn carpets over splintered floors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;How do you keep them out?&quot; he
asked, wistfully. &quot;Those mechanicals?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The stooped and gaunt old man rose stiffly
to move a pair of pliers and some odds and ends of sheet metal off a crippled
chair, and motioned graciously for him to be seated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I have a certain immunity,&quot;
Sledge told him gravely. &quot;The place where I live they cannot enter, unless
I ask them. That is an amendment to the Prime Directive. They can neither help
nor hinder me, unless I request it—and I won't do that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Careful of the chair's uncertain balance,
Underhill sat for a moment, staring. The old man's hoarse, vehement voice was
as strange as his words. He had a gray, shocking pallor, and his cheeks and
sockets seemed alarmingly hollowed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Have you been ill, Mr. Sledge?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;No worse than usual. Just very
busy.&quot; With a haggard smile, he nodded at the floor. Underhill saw a tray
where he had set it aside, bread drying up, and a covered dish grown cold.
&quot;I was going to eat it later,&quot; he rumbled apologetically. &quot;Your
wife has been very kind to bring me food, but I'm afraid I've been too much
absorbed in my work.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>His emaciated arm gestured at the table.
The little device there had grown. Small machinings of precious white metal and
lustrous plastic had been assembled, with neatly soldered busbars, into
something which showed purpose and design.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>A long palladium needle was hung on jeweled
pivots, equipped like a telescope with exquisitely graduated circles and
vernier scales, and driven like a telescope with a tiny motor. A small concave
palladium mirror, at the base of it, faced a similar mirror mounted on
something not quite like a small rotary converter. Thick silver busbars con­nected
that to a plastic box with knobs and dials on top, and also to a foot-thick
sphere of gray lead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The old man's preoccupied reserve did not,
encourage questions, but Underhill, remembering that sleek black shape inside
the new windows of his house, felt queerly reluctant to leave this haven from
the humanoids.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;What is your work?&quot; he ventured.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Old Sledge looked at him sharply, with dark
feverish eyes, and finally said, &quot;My last research project. I am
attempting to measure the constant of the rhodomagnetic quanta.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>His hoarse tired voice had a dull finality,
as if to dismiss the matter and Underhill himself. But Underhill was haunted
with a terror of the black shining slave that had become the master of his
house, and he refused to be dismissed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;What is this certain immunity?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Sitting gaunt and bent on the tall stool,
staring moodily at the long bright needle and the lead sphere, the old man
didn't answer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;These mechanicals!&quot; Underhill
burst out, nervously. &quot;They've smashed my business and moved into my
home.&quot; He searched the old man's dark, seamed face. &quot;Tell me—you must
know more about them—isn't there any way to get rid of them?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>After half a minute, the old man's brooding
eyes left the lead ball, and the gaunt shaggy head nodded wearily. &quot;That's
what I am trying to do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Can I help you?&quot; Underhill
trembled, with a sudden eager hope. &quot;I'll do anything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Perhaps you can.&quot; The sunken
eyes watched him thoughtfully, with some strange fever in them. &quot;If you
can do such work.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I had engineering training,&quot;
Underhill reminded him, &quot;and I've a workshop in the basement. There's a
model I built.&quot; He pointed at the trim little hull, hung over the mantel
in the tiny living room. &quot;I'll do anything I can.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Even as he spoke, however, the spark of
hope was drowned in a sudden wave of overwehelming doubt. Why should he believe
this old rogue, when he knew Aurora's taste in tenants? He ought to remember
the game he used to play, and start counting up the score of lies. He stood up
from the crippled chair, staring cynically at the patched old vagabond and his
fantastic toy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;What's the use?&quot; His voice
turned suddenly harsh. &quot;You had me going, there, and I'd do anything to
stop them, really. But what makes you think you can do anything?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The haggard old man regarded him
thoughtfully.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I should be able to stop them,&quot;
Sledge said softly. &quot;Because, you see, I'm the unfortunate fool who
started them. I really intended them to serve and obey, and to guard men from
harm. Yes, the Prime Directive was my own idea. I didn't know what it would
lead to.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dusk crept slowly into the shabby little
rooms. Darkness gathered in the unswept corners, and thickened on the floor.
The toylike machines on the kitchen table grew vague and strange, until the
last light made a linger­ing glow on the white palladium needle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Outside, the town seemed queerly hushed.
Just across the alley, the humanoids were building a new house, quite silently.
They never spoke to one another, for each knew all that any of them did. The
strange materials they used went together without any noise of hammer or saw.
Small blind things, moving surely in the growing dark, they seemed as soundless
as shadows.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Sitting on the high stool, bowed and tired
and old, Sledge told his story. Listening, Underhill sat down again, careful of
the broken chair. He watched the hands of Sledge, gnarled and corded and darkly
burned, powerful once but shrunken and trembling now, restless in the dark.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Better keep this to yourself. I'll
tell you how they started, so you will understand what we have to do. But you
had better not mention it outside these rooms—because the humanoids have very
efficient ways of eradi­cating unhappy memories, or purposes that threaten
their discharge of the Prime Directive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;They're very efficient,&quot;
Underhill bitterly agreed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;That's all the trouble,&quot; the old
man said. &quot;I tried to build a perfect machine. I was altogether too
successful. This is how it happened.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>A gaunt haggard man, sitting stooped and
tired in the growing dark, he told his story.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Sixty years ago, on the arid southern
continent of Wing IV, I was an instructor of atomic theory in a small
technological college. Very young. An idealist. Rather ignorant, I'm afraid, of
life and politics and war—of nearly everything, I suppose, except atomic
theory.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>His furrowed face made a brief sad smile in
the dusk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I had too much faith in facts, I
suppose, and too little in men. I mistrusted emotion, because I had no time for
anything but science. I remember being swept along with a fad for general
semantics. I wanted to apply the scien­tific method to every situation, and
reduce all experience to formula. I'm afraid I was pretty impatient with human
ignorance and error, and I thought that science alone could make the perfect
world.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He sat silent for a moment, staring out at
the black silent things that flitted shadowlike about the new palace that was
rising as swiftly as a dream across the alley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;There was a girl.&quot; His great tired
shoulders made a sad little shrug. &quot;If things had been a little different,
we might have married, and lived out our lives in that quiet little college
town, and perhaps reared a child or two. And there would have been no
humanoids.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He sighed, in the cool creeping dusk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I was finishing my thesis on the
separation of the palladium isotopes—a pretty little project, but I should have
been content with that. She was a biologist, but she was planning to retire
when we married. I think we should have been two very happy people, quite
ordinary, and altogether harmless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;But then there was a war—wars had
been too frequent on the worlds of Wing, ever since they were colonized. I
survived it in a secret underground laboratory, designing military mechanicals.
But she volunteered to join a mili­tary research project in biotoxins. There
was an accident. A few molecules of a new virus got into the air, and everybody
on the project died unpleasantly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I was left with my science, and a
bitterness that was bard to forget. When the war was over I went back to the
little college with a military research grant. The project was pure science—a
theoretical investigation of the nuclear binding forces, then misunderstood. I
wasn't expect­ed to produce an actual weapon, and I didn't recognize the weapon
when I found it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;It was only a few pages of rather
difficult mathemat­ics. A novel theory of atomic structure, involving a new
expression for one component of the binding forces. But the tensors seemed to
be a harmless abstraction. I saw no way to test the theory or manipulate the
predicated force. The military authorities cleared my paper for publication in
a little technical review put out by the college.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;The next year, I made an appalling
discovery—I found the meaning of those tensors. The elements of the rhodi­um
triad turned out to be an unexpected key to the manipulation of that
theoretical force. Unfortunately, my paper had been reprinted abroad, and
several other men must have made the same unfortunate discovery, at about the
same time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;The war, which ended in less than a
year, was proba­bly started by a laboratory accident. Men failed to antici­pate
the capacity of tuned rhodomagnetic radiations, to unstabilize the heavy atoms.
A deposit of heavy ores was detonated, no doubt by sheer mischance, and the
blast obliterated the incautious experimenter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;The surviving military forces of that
nation retaliated against their supposed attackers, and their rhodomagnetic
beams made the old-fashioned plutonium bombs seem pretty harmless. A beam
carrying only a few watts of power could fission the heavy metals in distant
electrical instruments, or the silver coins that men carried in their pockets,
the gold fillings in their teeth, or even the iodine in their thyroid glands.
If that was not enough, slightly more powerful beams could set off heavy ores,
beneath them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Every continent of Wing IV was plowed
with new chasms vaster than the ocean deeps, and piled up with new volcanic
mountains. The atmosphere was poisoned with radioactive dust and gases, and
rain fell thick with deadly mud. Most life was obliterated, even in the shel­ters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>“Bodily, I was again unhurt. Once more, I
had been imprisoned in an underground site, this time designing new types of
military mechanicals to be powered and controlled by rhodomagnetic beams—for
war had become far too swift and deadly to be fought by human soldiers. The
site was located in an area of light sedimentary rocks, which could not be
detonated, and the tunnels were shield­ed against the fissioning frequencies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Mentally, however, I must have
emerged almost insane. My own discovery had laid the planet in ruins. That load
of guilt was pretty heavy for any man to carry, and it corroded my last faith
in the goodness and integrity of man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I tried to undo what I had done.
Fighting mechanicals, armed with rhodomagnetic weapons, had desolated the
planet. Now I began planning rhodomagnetic mechanicals to clear the rubble and
rebuild the ruins.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I tried to design these new
mechanicals to obey forever certain implanted commands, so that they could
never be used for war or crime or any other injury to mankind. That was very
difficult technically, and it got me into more difficulties with a few
politicians and military adventurers who wanted unrestricted mechanicals for
their own military schemes—while little worth fighting for was left on Wing IV,
there were other planets, happy and ripe for the looting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Finally, to finish the new
mechanicals, I was forced to disappear. I escaped on an experimental
rhodomagnetic craft, with a number of the best mechanicals I had made, and
managed to reach an island continent where the fission of deep ores had
destroyed the whole population.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;At last we landed on a bit of level
plain, surrounded with tremendous new mountains. Hardly a hospitable spot. The
soil was burned under layers of black clinkers and poisonous mud. The dark
precipitous new summits all around were jagged with fracture-planes and mantled
with lava flows. The highest peaks were already white with snow, but volcanic
cones were still pouring out clouds of dark and lurid death. Everything had the
color of fire and the shape of fury.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I had to take fantastic precautions
there, to protect my own life. I stayed aboard the ship, until the first
shielded laboratory was finished. I wore elaborate armor, and breathing masks.
I used every medical resource, to repair the damage from destroying rays and
particles. Even so, I fell desperately ill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;But the mechanicals were at home
there. The radia­tions didn't hurt them. The awesome surroundings couldn't
depress them, because they had no emotions. The lack of life didn't matter,
because they weren't alive. There, in that spot so alien and hostile to life,
the humanoids were born.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Stooped and bleakly cadaverous in the
growing dark, the old man fell silent for a little time. His haggard eyes
stared solemnly at the small hurried shapes that moved like restless shadows
out across the alley, silently building a strange new palace, which glowed
faintly in the night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Somehow, I felt at home there,
too,&quot; his deep, hoarse voice went on deliberately. &quot;My belief in my
own kind was gone. Only mechanicals were with me, and I put my faith in them. I
was determined to build better mechani­cals, immune to human imperfections,
able to save men from themselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;The humanoids became the dear
children of my sick mind. There is no need to describe the labor pains. There
were errors, abortions, monstrosities. There were sweat and agony and
heartbreak. Some years had passed, before the safe delivery of <sup>'</sup>the
first perfect humanoid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Then there was the Central to
build—for all the indi­vidual humanoids were to be no more than the limbs and
the senses of a single mechanical brain. That was what opened the possibility
of real perfection. The old electron­ic mechanicals, with their separate
relay-centers and their own feeble batteries, had built-in limitations. They
were necessarily stupid, weak, clumsy, slow. Worst of all, it seemed to me,
they were exposed to human tampering.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;The Central rose above those imperfections.
Its power beams supplied every unit with unfailing energy, from great fission
plants. Its control beams provided each unit with an unlimited memory and
surpassing intelligence. Best of all—so I then believed—it could be securely
protected from any human meddling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;The whole reaction-system was
designed to protect itself from any interference by human selfishness or fanat­icism.
It was built to insure the safety and the happiness of men, automatically. You
know the Prime Directive: <i>to serve and obey, and guard men from harm.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;The old individual mechanicals I had
brought helped to manufacture the parts, and I put the first section of Central
together with my own hands. That took three years. When it was finished the
first waiting humanoid came to life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Sledge peered moodily through the dark at
Underhill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;It really seemed alive to me,&quot;
his slow deep voice insisted. &quot;Alive, and more wonderful than any human
being, because it was created to preserve life. Ill and alone, I was yet the
proud father of a new creation, perfect, forever free from any possible choice
of evil.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Faithfully, the humanoids obeyed the
Prime Directive. The first units built others, and they built underground
factories to mass-produce the coming hordes. Their new ships poured ores and
sand into atomic furnaces under the plain, and new perfect humanoids came
marching back out of the dark mechanical matrix.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;The swarming humanoids built a new
tower for the Central, a white and lofty metal pylon, standing splendid in the
midst of that fire-scarred desolation. Level on level, they joined new
relay-sections into one brain, until its grasp was almost infinite.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Then they went out to rebuild the
ruined planet, and later to carry their perfect service to other worlds. I was
well pleased, then. I thought I had found the end of war and crime, of poverty
and inequality, of human blundering and resulting human pain.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The old man sighed, and moved heavily in
the dark. &quot;You can see that I was wrong.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill drew his eyes back from the dark
unresting things, shadow-silent, building that glowing palace outside the
window. A small doubt arose in him, for he was used to scoffing privately at
much less remarkable tales from Aurora's remarkable tenants. But the worn old
man had spoken with a quiet and sober air; and the black invaders, he reminded
himself, had not intruded here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Why didn't you stop them?&quot; he

lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I stayed too long at the
Central.&quot; Sledge sighed again, regretfully. &quot;I was useful there,
until everything was finished. I designed new fission plants, and even planned
methods for introducing the humanoid service with a minimum of confusion and
opposition.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill grinned wryly, in the dark.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I've met the methods,&quot; he commented.
&quot;Quite effi­cient.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I must have worshiped efficiency,
then,&quot; Sledge wearily agreed. &quot;Dead facts, abstract truth, mechanical
perfec­tion. I must have hated the fragilities of human beings, because I was
content to polish the perfection of the new humanoids. It's a sorry confession,
but I found a kind of happiness in that dead wasteland. Actually, I'm afraid I
fell in love with my own creations.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>His hollowed eyes, in the dark, had a
fevered gleam.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I was awakened, at last, by a man who
came to kill me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Gaunt and bent, the old man moved stiffly
in the thickening gloom. Underhill shifted his balance, careful of the crippled
chair. He waited, and the slow, deep voice went on,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I never learned just who he was, or
exactly how he came. No ordinary man could have accomplished what he did, and I
used to wish that I had known him sooner. He must have been a remarkable
physicist and an expert mountaineer. I imagine he had also been a hunter. I
know that he was intelligent, and terribly determined.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Yes, he really came to kill me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Somehow, he reached that great
island, undetected. There were still no inhabitants—the humanoids allowed no
man but me to come so near the Central. Somehow, he came past their search
beams, and their automatic weap­ons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;The shielded plane he used was later
found, abandoned on a high glacier. He came down the rest of the way on foot
through those raw new mountains, where no paths existed. Somehow, he came alive
across lava beds that were still burning with deadly atomic fire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Concealed with some sort of
rhodomagnetic screen—I was never allowed to examine it—he came undiscovered
across the spaceport that now covered most of that great plain, and into the
new city around the Central tower. It must have taken more courage and resolve than
most men have, but I never learned exactly how he did it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Somehow, he got to my office in the
tower. He screamed at me, and I looked up to see him in the doorway. He was
nearly naked, scraped and bloody from the mountains. He had a gun in his raw,
red hand, but the thing that shocked me was the burning hatred in his
eyes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Hunched on that high stool, in the dark
little room, the old man shuddered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I had never seen such monstrous,
unutterable hatred, not even in the victims of war. And I had never heard such
hatred as rasped at me, in the few words he screamed, `I've come to kill you,
Sledge. To stop your mechanicals, and set men free.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Of course he was mistaken, there. It
was already far too late for my death to stop the humanoids, but he didn't know
that. He lifted his unsteady gun, in both bleeding hands, and fired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;His screaming challenge had given me
a second or so of warning. I dropped down behind the desk. And that first shot
revealed him to the humanoids, which somehow hadn't been aware of him before.
They piled on him, before he could fire again. They took away the gun, and
ripped off a kind of net of fine white wire that had covered his body—that must
have been part of his screen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;His hatred was what awoke me. I had
always assumed that most men, except for a thwarted few, would be grateful for
the humanoids. I found it hard to understand his hatred, but the humanoids told
me now that many men had required drastic treatment by brain surgery, drugs,
and hypnosis to make them happy under the Prime Direc­tive. This was not the
first desperate effort to kill me that they had blocked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I wanted to question the stranger,
but the humanoids rushed him away to an operating room. When they finally let
me see him, he gave me a pale silly grin from his bed. He remembered his name;
he even knew me—the hu­manoids had developed a remarkable skill at such treat­ments.
But he didn't know how he had got to my office, or that he had ever tried to
kill me. He kept whispering that he liked the humanoids, because they existed
to make men happy. And he was very happy now. As soon as he was able to be
moved, they took him to the spaceport. I never saw him again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I began to see what I had done. The
humanoids had built me a rhodomagnetic yacht, that I used to take for long
cruises in space, working aboard—I used to like the perfect quiet, and the feel
of being the only human being within a hundred million miles. Now I called for
the yacht, and started out on a cruise around the planet, to learn why that man
had hated me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The old man nodded at the dim hastening
shapes, busy across the alley, putting together that strange shining palace in
the soundless dark.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;You can imagine what I found,&quot;
he said. &quot;Bitter futili­ty, imprisoned in empty splendor. The humanoids
were too efficient, with their care for the safety and happiness of men, and
there was nothing left for men to do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He peered down in the increasing gloom at
his own great hands, competent yet but battered and scarred with a lifetime of
effort. They clenched into fighting fists and wearily relaxed again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I found something worse than war and
crime and want and death.&quot; His low rumbling voice held a savage bitter­ness.
&quot;Utter futility. Men sat with idle hands, because there was nothing left
for them to do. They were pam­pered prisoners, really, locked up in a highly
efficient jail. Perhaps they tried to play, but there was nothing left worth
playing for. Most active sports were declared too dangerous for men, under the
Prime Directive. Science was forbidden, because laboratories can manufacture
dan­ger. Scholarship was needless, because the humanoids could answer <i>any </i>question.
Art had, degenerated into grim reflection of futility. Purpose and hope were
dead. No goal was left for existence. You could take up some inane hobby, play
a pointless game of cards, or go for a harmless walk in the park—with always
the humanoids watching. They were stronger than men, better at everything,
swimming or chess, singing or archeology. They must have given the race a mass
complex of inferiority.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;No wonder men had tried to kill me!
Because there was no escape from that dead futility. Nicotine was disap­proved.
Alcohol was rationed. Drugs were forbidden. Sex was carefully supervised. Even
suicide was clearly contra­dictory to the Prime Directive—and the humanoids had
learned to keep all possible lethal instruments out of reach.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Staring at the last white gleam on that
thin palladium needle, the old man sighed again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;When I got back to the Central,&quot;
he went on, &quot;I tried to modify the Prime Directive. I had never meant it
to be applied so thoroughly. Now I saw that it must be changed to give men
freedom to live and to grow, to work and to play, to risk their lives if they
pleased, to choose and take the consequences.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;But that stranger had come too late.
I had built the Central too well. The Prime Directive was the whole basis of
its relay system. It was built to protect the Directive from human meddling. It
did—even from my own. Its logic, as usual, was perfect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;The attempt on my life, the humanoids
announced, proved that their elaborate defense of the Central and the Prime
Directive still was not enough. They were preparing to evacuate the entire
population of the planet to homes on other worlds. When I tried to change the
Directive, they sent me with the rest.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill peered at the worn old man, in
the dark.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;But you have this immunity,&quot; he
said, puzzled. &quot;How could they coerce you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I had thought I was protected,&quot;
Sledge told him. &quot;I had built into the relays an injunction that the humanoids
must not interfere with my freedom of action, or come into a place where I am,
or touch me at all, without my specific request. Unfortunately, however, I had
been too anxious to guard the Prime Directive from any human hampering.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;When I went into the tower, to change
the relays, they followed me. They wouldn't let me reach the crucial relays.
When I persisted, they ignored the immunity order. They overpowered me, and put
me aboard the cruiser. Now that I wanted to alter the Prime Directive, they told
me, I had become as dangerous as any man. I must never return to Wing IV
again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Hunched on the stool, the old man made an
empty little shrug.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Ever since, I've been an exile. My
only dream has been to stop the humanoids. Three times I tried to go back, with
weapons on the cruiser to destroy the Central, but their patrol ships always
challenged me before I was near enough to strike. The last time, they seized
the cruiser and captured a few men who were with me. They removed the unhappy
memories and the dangerous pur­poses of the others. Because of that immunity,
however, they let me go, after I was weaponless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Since, I've been a refugee. From
planet to planet, year after year, I've had to keep moving, to stay ahead of
them. On several different worlds, I have published my rhodomagnetic
discoveries and tried to make men strong enough to withstand their advance. But
rhodomagnetic science is dangerous. Men who have learned it need pro­tection
more than any others, under the Prime Directive. They have always come, too
soon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The old man paused, and sighed again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;They can spread very fast, with their
new rhodomag­netic ships, and there is no limit to their hordes. Wing IV must
be one single hive of them now, and they are trying to carry the Prime
Directive to every human planet. There's no escape, except to stop them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill was staring at the toylike
machines, the long bright needle and the dull leaden ball, dim in the dark on
the kitchen table. Anxiously he whispered,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;But you hope to stop them, now—with
that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;If we can finish it in time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;But how?&quot; Underhill shook his
head. &quot;It's so tiny.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;But big enough,&quot; Sledge
insisted. &quot;Because it's something they don't understand. They are
perfectly efficient in the integration and application of everything they know,
but they are not creative.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He gestured at the gadgets on the table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;This device doesn't look impressive,
but it is something new. It uses rhodomagnetic energy to build atoms, instead
of to fission them. The more stable atoms, you know, are those near the middle
of the periodic scale, and energy can be released by putting light atoms
together, as well as by breaking up heavy ones.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The deep voice had a sudden ring of power.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;This device is the key to the energy
of the stars. For stars shine with the liberated energy of building atoms, of
hydrogen converted into helium, chiefly, through the carbon cycle. This device
will start the integration process as a chain reaction, through the catalytic
effect of a tuned rhodomagnetic beam of the intensity and frequency re­quired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;The humanoids will not allow any man
within three light-years of the Central, now—but they can't suspect the
possibility of this device. I can use it from here—to turn the hydrogen in the
seas of Wing IV into helium, and most of the helium and the oxygen into heavier
atoms, still. A hundred years from now, astronomers on this planet should
observe the flash of a brief and sudden nova in that direction. But the humanoids
ought to stop, the instant we release the beam.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill sat tense and frowning, in the
night. The old man's voice was sober and convincing, and that grim story had a
solemn ring of truth. He could see the black and silent humanoids, flitting ceaselessly
about the faintly glowing walls of that new mansion across the alley. He had
quite forgotten his low opinion of Aurora's tenants.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;And we'll be killed, I suppose?&quot;
he asked huskily. <sup>&quot;</sup>That chain reaction—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Sledge shook his emaciated head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;The integration process requires a
certain very low intensity of radiation,&quot; he explained. &quot;In our
atmosphere, here, the beam will be far too intense to start any reac­tion—we
can even use the device here in the room, because the walls will be transparent
to the beam.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill nodded, relieved. He was just a
small busi­nessman, upset because his business had been destroyed, unhappy
because his freedom was slipping away. He hoped that Sledge could stop the
humanoids, but he didn't want to be a martyr.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Good!&quot; He caught a deep breath.
&quot;Now, what has to be done?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Sledge gestured in the dark toward the
table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;The integrator itself is nearly
complete,&quot; he said. &quot;A small fission generator, in that lead shield.
Rhodomagnetic converter, tuning coils, transmission mirrors, and focusing
needle. What we lack is the director.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Director?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;The sighting instrument,&quot; Sledge
explained. &quot;Any sort of telescopic sight would be useless, you see—the
planet must have moved a good bit in the last hundred years, and the beam must
be extremely narrow to reach so far. We'll have to use a rhodomagnetic scanning
ray, with an elec­tronic converter to make an image we can see. I have the
cathode-ray tube, and drawings for the other parts.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He climbed stiffly down from the high stool
and snapped on the lights at last—cheap fluorescent fixtures which a man could
light and extinguish for himself. He unrolled his drawings, and explained the
work that Un­derhill could do. And Underhill agreed to come back early next
morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I can bring some tools from my
workshop,&quot; he added. &quot;There's a small lathe I used to turn parts for
models, a portable drill, and a vise.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;We need them,&quot; the old man said.
&quot;But watch yourself. You don't have my immunity, remember. And, if they
ever suspect, mine is gone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Reluctantly, then, he left the shabby
little rooms with the cracks in the yellowed plaster and the worn familiar
carpets over the familiar floor. He shut the door behind him—a common, creaking
wooden door, simple enough for a man to work. Trembling and afraid, he went
back down the steps and across to the new shining door that he couldn't open.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;At your service, Mr. Underhill.&quot;
Before he could lift his hand to knock, that bright smooth panel slid back
silently. Inside, the little black mechanical stood waiting, blind and forever
alert. &quot;Your dinner is ready, sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Something made him shudder. In its slender
naked grace, he could see the power of all those teeming hordes, benevolent and
yet appalling, perfect and invincible. The flimsy little weapon that Sledge called
an integrator seemed suddenly a forlorn and foolish hope. A black depression
settled upon him, but he didn't dare to show it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill went circumspectly down the
basement steps, next morning, to steal his own tools. He found the base­ment
enlarged and changed. The new floor, warm and dark and elastic, made his feet
as silent as a humanoid's. The new walls shone softly. Neat luminous signs
identified several new doors: LAUNDRY, STORAGE, GAME ROOM, WORKSHOP.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He paused uncertainly in front of the last.
The new sliding panel glowed with a soft greenish light. It was locked. The
lock had no keyhole, but only a little oval plate of some white metal, which
doubtless covered a rhodomagnetic relay. He pushed at it, uselessly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;At your service, Mr. Underhill.&quot;
He made a guilty start, and tried not to show the sudden trembling in his
knees. He had made sure that one humanoid would be busy for half an hour,
washing Aurora's hair, and he hadn't known there was another in the house. It
must have come out of the door marked storage, for it stood there motionless
beneath the sign, benevolently solicitous, beautiful and terrible. &quot;What
do you wish?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Er . . . nothing.&quot; Its blind
steel eyes were staring, and he felt that it must see his secret purpose. He
groped desperately for logic. &quot;Just looking around.&quot; His jerky voice
came hoarse and dry. &quot;Some improvements you've made!&quot; He nodded
desperately at the door marked GAME ROOM. &quot;What's in there?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>It didn't even have to move to work the
concealed relay. The bright panel slid silently open, as he started toward it.
Dark walls, beyond, burst into soft lumines­cence. The room was bare.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;We are manufacturing recreational
equipment,&quot; it ex­plained brightly. &quot;We shall furnish the room as
soon as possible.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>To end an awkward pause, Underhill muttered
desper­ately, &quot;Little Frank has a set of darts, and I think we had some
old exercising clubs&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;We have taken them away,&quot; the
humanoid informed him softly. &quot;Such instruments are dangerous. We shall
furnish safe equipment.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Suicide, he remembered, was also forbidden.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;A set of wooden blocks, I
suppose,&quot; he said bitterly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Wooden blocks are dangerously
hard,&quot; it told him gently &quot;and wooden splinters can be harmful. But
we manufac­ture plastic building blocks, which are quite safe. Do you wish a
set of those?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He stared at its dark, graceful face,
speechless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;We shall also have to remove the
tools from your workshop,&quot; it informed him softly. &quot;Such tools are
exces­sively dangerous, but we can supply you with equipment for shaping soft
plastics.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Thanks,&quot; he muttered uneasily.
&quot;No rush about that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He started to retreat, and the humanoid
stopped him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Now that you have lost your
business,&quot; it urged, &quot;we suggest that you formally accept our total
service. Assignors have a preference, and we shall be able to complete your
household staff, at once.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;No rush about that, either,&quot; he
said grimly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He escaped from the house—although he had
to wait for it to open the back door for him—and climbed the stair to the garage
apartment. Sledge let him in. He sank into the crippled kitchen chair, grateful
for the cracked walls that didn't shine and the door that a man could work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I couldn't get the tools,&quot; he
reported despairingly, &quot;and they are going to take them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>By gray daylight, the old man looked bleak
and pale. His raw-boned face was drawn, and the hollowed sockets deeply
shadowed, as if he hadn't slept. Underhill saw the tray of neglected food,
still forgotten on the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I'll go back with you.&quot; The old
man was worn and ill, yet his tortured eyes had a spark of undying purpose.
&quot;We must have the tools. I believe my immunity will protect us both.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He found a battered traveling bag.
Underhill went with him back down the steps, and across to the house. At the
back door, he produced a tiny horseshoe of white palladi­um, and touched it to
the metal oval. The door slid open promptly, and they went on through the
kitchen to the basement stair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>A black little mechanical stood at the
sink, washing dishes with never a splash or a clatter. Underhill glanced at it
uneasily—he supposed this must be the one that had come upon him from the
storage room, since the other should still be busy with Aurora's hair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Sledge's dubious immunity seemed a very
uncertain defense against its vast, remote intelligence. Underhill felt a
tingling shudder. He hurried on, breathless and relieved, for it ignored them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The basement corridor was dark. Sledge
touched the tiny horseshoe to another relay to light the walls. He opened the
workshop door, and lit the walls inside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The shop had been dismantled. Benches and
cabinets were demolished. The old concrete walls had been covered with some
sleek, luminous stuff. For one sick moment, Underhill thought that the tools
were already gone. Then he found them, piled in a corner with the archery set
that Aurora had bought the summer before—another item too dangerous for fragile
and suicidal humanity—all ready for disposal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>They loaded the bag with the tiny lathe,
the drill and vise, and a few smaller tools. Underhill took up the burden, and
Sledge extinguished the wall light and closed the door. Still the humanoid was
busy at the sink, and still it didn't seem aware of them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Sledge was suddenly blue and wheezing, and he
had to stop to cough on the outside steps, but at last they got back to the
little apartment, where the invaders were forbidden to intrude. Underhill
mounted the lathe on the battered library table in the tiny front room, and
went to work. Slowly, day by day, the director took form.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Sometimes Underhill's doubts came back.
Sometimes, when he watched the cyanotic color of Sledge's haggard face and the
wild trembling of his twisted, shrunken hands, he was afraid the old man's mind
might be as ill as his body, and his plan to stop the dark invaders, all foolish
illusion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Sometimes, when he studied that tiny
machine on the kitchen table, the pivoted needle and the thick lead ball, the
whole project seemed the sheerest folly. How could anything detonate the seas
of a planet so far away that its very mother star was a telescopic object?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The humanoids, however, always cured his
doubts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>It was always hard for Underhill to leave
the shelter of the little apartment, because he didn't feel at home in the
bright new world the humanoids were building. He didn't care for the shining
splendor of his new bathroom, because he couldn<sup>'</sup>t work the taps—some
suicidal human being might try to drown himself. He didn't like the windows
that only a mechanical could open—a man might accidentally fall, or suicidally
jump—or even the majestic music room with the wonderful glittering
radio-phonograph that only a humanoid could play.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He began to share the old man's desperate
urgency, but Sledge warned him solemnly, &quot;You mustn't spend too much time
with me. You mustn't let them guess our work is so important. Better put on an
act—you're slowly get­ting to like them, and you're just killing time, helping
me.<sup>&quot;</sup></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill tried, but he was not an actor.
He went dutifully home for his meals. He tried painfully to invent
conversation—about anything else than detonating plan­ets. He tried to seem
enthusiastic, when Aurora took him to inspect some remarkable improvement to
the house. He applauded Gay's recitals, and went with Frank for hikes in the
wonderful new parks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>And he saw what the humanoids did to his
family. That was enough to renew his faith in Sledge's integrator, and redouble
his determination that the humanoids must be stopped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Aurora, in the beginning, had bubbled with
praise for the marvelous new mechanicals. They did the household drudgery,
brought the food and planned the meals and washed the children's necks. They
turned her out in stun­ning gowns, and gave her plenty of time for cards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Now, she had too much time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>She had really liked to cook—a few special
dishes, at least, that were family favorites. But stoves were hot and knives
were sharp. Kitchens were altogether too danger­ous for careless and suicidal
human beings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Fine needlework had been her hobby, but the
hu­manoids took away her needles. She had enjoyed driving the car, but that was
no longer allowed. She turned for escape to a shelf of novels, but the
humanoids took them all away, because they dealt with unhappy people in dan­gerous
situations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>One afternoon, Underhill found her in tears.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;It's too much,&quot; she gasped
bitterly. &quot;I hate and loathe every naked one of them. They seemed so
wonderful at first, but now they won't even let me eat a bite of candy. Can't
we get rid of them, dear? Ever?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>A blind little mechanical was standing at his
elbow, and he had to say they couldn't.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Our function is to serve all men,
forever,&quot; it assured them softly. &quot;It was necessary for us to take
your sweets, Mrs. Underhill, because the slightest degree of overweight reduces
life-expectancy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Not even the children escaped that absolute
solicitude. Frank was robbed of a whole arsenal of lethal instru­ments—football
and boxing gloves, pocketknife, tops, slingshot, and skates. He didn't like the
harmless plastic toys, which replaced them. He tried to run away, but a
humanoid recognized him on the road, and brought him back to school.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Gay had always dreamed of being a great
musician. The new mechanicals had replaced her human teachers, since they came.
Now, one evening when Underhill asked her to play, she announced quietly,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Father, I'm not going to play the
violin any more.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Why, darling?&quot; He stared at her,
shocked, and saw the bitter resolve on her face. &quot;You've been doing so
well—especially since the humanoids took over your lessons.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;They're the trouble, Father.&quot;
Her voice, for a child's, sounded strangely tired and old. &quot;They are too
good. No matter how long and hard I try, I could never be as good as they are.
It isn't any use. Don't you understand, Fa­ther?&quot; Her voice quivered.
&quot;It just isn't any use.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He understood. Renewed resolution sent him
back to his secret task. The humanoids had to be stopped. Slowly the director
grew, until a time came finally when Sledge's bent and unsteady fingers fitted
into place the last tiny part that Underhill had made, and carefully soldered
the last connection. Huskily, the old man whispered,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;It's done.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>That was another dusk. Beyond the windows
of the shabby little rooms—windows of common glass, bubble-marred and flimsy,
but simple enough for a man to man­age—the town of Two Rivers had assumed an
alien splen­dor. The old street lamps were gone, but now the coming night was
challenged by the walls of strange new mansions and villas, all aglow with
color. A few dark and silent humanoids still were busy on the luminous roofs of
the palace across the alley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Inside the humble walls of the small
manmade apart­ment, the new director was mounted on the end of the little
kitchen table—which Underhill had reinforced and bolted to the floor. Soldered
busbars joined director and integrator, and the thin palladium needle swung
obediently as Sledge tested the knobs with his battered, quivering fingers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Ready,&quot; he said hoarsely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>His rusty voice seemed calm enough, at
first, but his breathing was too fast. His big gnarled hands began to tremble
violently, and Underhill saw the sudden blue that stained his pinched and
haggard face. Seated on the high stool, he clutched desperately at the edge of
the table. Underhill saw his agony, and hurried to bring his medi­cine. He
gulped it, and his rasping breath began to slow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Thanks,&quot; his whisper rasped
unevenly. &quot;I'll be all right. I've time enough.&quot; He glanced out at
the few dark naked things that still flitted shadowlike about the golden towers
and the glowing crimson dome of the palace across the alley. &quot;Watch
them,&quot; he said. &quot;Tell me when they stop.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He waited to quiet the trembling of his
hands, and then began to move the director's knobs. The integrator's long
needle swung, as silently as light.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Human eyes were blind to that force, which
might detonate a planet. Human ears were deaf to it. The cathode-ray tube was
mounted in the director cabinet, to make the faraway target visible to feeble
human senses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The needle was pointing at the kitchen
wall, but that would be transparent to the beam. The little machine looked
harmless as a toy, and it was silent as a moving humanoid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The needle swung, and spots of greenish
light moved across the tube's fluorescent field, representing the stars that
were scanned by the timeless, searching beam—silently seeking out the world to
be destroyed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill recognized familiar
constellations, vastly dwarfed. They crept across the field, as the silent
needle swung. When three stars formed an unequal triangle in the center of the
field, the needle steadied suddenly. Sledge touched other knobs, and the green
points spread apart. Between them, another fleck of green was born.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;The Wing!&quot; whispered Sledge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The other stars spread beyond the field,
and that green fleck grew. It was alone in the field, a bright and tiny disk.
Suddenly, then, a dozen other tiny pips were visible, spaced close about it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Wing IV!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The old man's whisper was hoarse and
breathless. His hands quivered on the knobs, and the fourth pip outward from
the disk crept to the center of the field. It grew, and the others spread away.
It began to tremble like Sledge's hands.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Sit very still,&quot; came his
rasping whisper. &quot;Hold your breath. Nothing must disturb the needle.&quot;
He reached for another knob, and the touch set the greenish image to dancing
violently. He drew his hand back, kneaded and flexed it with the other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Now!&quot; His whisper was hushed and
strained. He nodded at the window. &quot;Tell me when they stop.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Reluctantly, Underhill dragged his eyes
from that intense gaunt figure, stooped over the thing that seemed a futile toy.
He looked out again, at two or three little black mechanicals busy about the
shining roofs across the alley. He waited for them to stop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He didn't dare to breathe. He felt the
loud, hurried hammer of his heart, and the nervous quiver of his mus­cles. He
tried to steady himself, tried not to think of the world about to be exploded,
so far away that the flash would not reach this planet for another century and
longer. The loud hoarse voice startled him:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Have they stopped?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He shook his head, and breathed again.
Carrying their unfamiliar tools and strange materials, the small black machines
were still busy across the alley, building an elaborate cupola above that
glowing crimson dome.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;They haven't stopped,&quot; he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Then we've failed.&quot; The old
man's voice was thin and ill. &quot;I don't know why.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The door rattled, then. They had locked it,
but the flimsy bolt was intended only to stop men. Metal snapped, and the door
swung open. A black mechanical came in, on soundless graceful feet. Its silvery
voice purred softly,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;At your service, Mr. Sledge.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The old man stared at it, with glazing,
stricken eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Get out of here!&quot; he rasped
bitterly. &quot;I forbid you—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Ignoring him, it darted to the kitchen
table. With a flashing certainty of action, it turned two knobs on the
director. The tiny screen went dark, and the palladium needle started spinning
aimlessly. Deftly it snapped a sol­dered connection, next to the thick lead
ball, and then its blind steel eyes turned to Sledge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;You were attempting to break the
Prime Directive.&quot; Its soft bright voice held no accusation, no malice or
anger. &quot;The injunction to respect your freedom is subordi­nate to the
Prime Directive, as you know, and it is therefore necessary for us to
interfere.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The old man turned ghastly. His head was
shrunken and cadaverous and blue, as if all the juice of life had been drained
away, and his <i>eyes </i>in their pitlike sockets had a wild, glazed stare.
His breath was a ragged, laborious gasping.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;How—?&quot; His voice was a feeble
mumbling. &quot;How did—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>And the little machine, standing black and
bland and utterly unmoving, told him cheerfully,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;We learned about rhodomagnetic
screens from that man who came to kill you, back on Wing IV. And the Central is
shielded, now, against your integrating beam.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>With lean muscles jerking convulsively on
his gaunt frame, old Sledge had come to his feet from the high stool. He stood
hunched and swaying, no more than a shrunken human husk, gasping painfully for
life, staring wildly into the blind steel eyes of the humanoid. He gulped, and
his lax blue mouth opened and closed, but no voice came.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;We have always been aware of your
dangerous proj­ect,&quot; the silvery tones dripped softly, &quot;because now
our senses are keener than you made them. We allowed you to complete it,
because the integration process will ultimately become necessary for our full
discharge of the Prime Directive. The supply of heavy metals for our fission
plants is limited, but now we shall be able to draw unlim­ited power from
integration plants.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Huh?&quot; Sledge shook himself,
groggily. &quot;What's that?&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Now we can serve men forever,&quot;
the black thing said serenely, &quot;on every world of every star.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The old man crumpled, as if from an
unendurable blow. He fell. The slim blind mechanical stood motionless, making
no effort to help him. Underhill was farther away, but he ran up in time to
catch the stricken man before his head struck the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Get moving!&quot; His shaken voice
came strangely calm. &quot;Get Dr. Winters.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The humanoid didn't move.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;The danger to the Prime Directive is
ended, now,&quot; it cooed. &quot;Therefore it is impossible for us to aid or
to hinder Mr. Sledge, in any way whatever.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Then call Dr. Winters for me,&quot;
rapped Underhill. &quot;At your service,&quot; it agreed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>But the old man, laboring for breath on the
floor, whispered faintly:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;No time . . . no use! I'm beaten . .
. done . . . a fool. Blind as a humanoid. Tell them ... to help me. Giving up
... my immunity. No use ... Anyhow. All humanity ... no use now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill gestured, and the sleek black
thing darted in solicitous obedience to kneel by the man on the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;You wish to surrender your special
exemption?&quot; it murmured brightly. &quot;You wish to accept our total
service for yourself, Mr. Sledge, under the Prime Directive?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Laboriously, Sledge nodded, laboriously
whispered, &quot;I do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Black mechanicals, at that, came swarming
into the shabby little rooms. One of them tore off Sledge's sleeve, and swabbed
his arm. Another brought a tiny hypodermic, and expertly administered an
intravenous injection. Then they picked him up gently, and carried him away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Several humanoids remained in the little
apartment, now a sanctuary no longer. Most of them had gathered about the
useless integrator. Carefully, as if their special senses were studying every detail,
they began taking it apart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>One little mechanical, however, came over
to Underhill. It stood motionless in front of him, staring through him with
sightless metal eyes. His legs began to tremble, and he swallowed uneasily.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Mr. Underhill,&quot; it cooed benevolently,
&quot;why did you help with this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Because I don't like you, or your
Prime Directive. Because you're choking the life out of all mankind, and I
wanted to stop it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Others have protested,&quot; it
purred softly. &quot;But only at first. In our efficient discharge of the Prime
Directive, we have learned how to make all men happy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill stiffened defiantly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Not all!&quot; he muttered. &quot;Not
quite!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The dark graceful oval of its face was
fixed in a look of alert benevolence and perpetual mild amazement. Its sil­very
voice was warm and kind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Like other human beings, Mr.
Underhill, you lack discrimination of good and evil. You have proved that by
your effort to break the Prime Directive. Now it will be necessary for you to
accept our total service, without further delay.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;All right,&quot; he yielded—and
muttered a bitter reserva­tion: &quot;You can smother men with too much care,
but that doesn't make them happy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Its soft voice challenged him brightly,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Just wait and see, Mr.
Underhill.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Next day, he was allowed to visit Sledge at
the city hospital. An alert black mechanical drove his car, and walked beside
him into the huge new building, and fol­lowed him into the old man's room—blind
steel eyes would be watching him, now, forever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Glad to see you, Underhill,&quot;
Sledge rumbled heartily from the bed. &quot;Feeling a lot better today, thanks.
That old headache is all but gone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill was glad to hear the booming
strength and the quick recognition in that deep voice—he had been afraid the
humanoids would tamper with the old man's memory. But he hadn't heard about any
headache. His eyes narrowed, puzzled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Sledge lay propped up, scrubbed very clean
and neatly shorn, with his gnarled old hands folded on top of the spotless
sheets. His raw-boned cheeks and sockets were hollowed, still, but a healthy
pink had replaced that death­ly blueness. Bandages covered the back of his
head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill shifted uneasily.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Oh!&quot; he whispered faintly.
&quot;I didn't know—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>A prim black mechanical, which had been
standing statue-like behind the bed, turned gracefully to Underhill,
explaining,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Mr. Sledge has been suffering for
many years from a benign tumor of the brain, which his human doctors failed to
diagnose. That caused his headaches, and certain persis­tent hallucinations. We
have removed the growth, and now the hallucinations have also vanished.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill stared uncertainly at the blind,
urbane me­chanical.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;What hallucinations?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Mr. Sledge thought he was a rhodomagnetic
engineer,&quot; the mechanical explained. &quot;He believed he was the creator of
the humanoids. He was troubled with an irrational belief that he did not like
the Prime Directive.<sup>&quot;</sup></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The wan man moved on the pillows,
astonished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Is that so?&quot; The gaunt face held
a cheerful blankness, and the hollow eyes flashed with a merely momentary
interest. &quot;Well, whoever did design them, they're pretty wonderful. Aren't
they, Underhill?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill was grateful that he didn't have
to answer, for the bright, empty eyes dropped shut and the old man fell
suddenly asleep. He felt the mechanical touch his sleeve, and saw its silent
nod. Obediently, he followed it away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Alert and solicitous, the little black
mechanical accom­panied him down the shining corridor, and worked the elevator
for him, and conducted him back to the car. It drove him efficiently back
through the new and splendid avenues, toward the magnificent prison of his
home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Sitting beside it in the car, he watched
its small deft hands on the wheel, the changing luster of bronze and blue on
its shining blackness. The final machine, perfect and beautiful, created to
serve mankind forever. He shud­dered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;At your service, Mr. Underhill.&quot;
Its blind steel eyes stared straight ahead, but it was still aware of him.
&quot;What's the matter, sir? Aren't you happy?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill felt cold and faint with terror.
His skin turned clammy, and a painful prickling came over him. His wet hand
tensed on the door handle of the car, but he restrained the impulse to jump and
run. That was folly. There was no escape. He made himself sit still.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;You will be happy, sir,&quot; the
mechanical promised him cheerfully. &quot;We have learned how to make all men
happy, under the Prime Directive. Our service is perfect, at last. Even Mr.
Sledge is very happy now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Underhill tried to speak, and his dry
throat stuck. He felt ill. The world turned dim and gray. The humanoids were
perfect—no question of that. They had even learned to lie, to secure the
contentment of men.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>He knew they had lied. That was no tumor
they had removed from Sledge's brain, but the memory, the scien­tific
knowledge, and the bitter disillusion of their own creator. But it was true
that Sledge was happy now. He tried to stop his own convulsive quivering.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;A wonderful operation!&quot; His
voice came forced and faint. &quot;You know, Aurora has had a lot of funny
tenants, but that old man was the absolute limit. The very idea that he had
made the humanoids, and he knew how to stop them! I always knew he must be
lying!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>Stiff with terror, he made a weak and
hollow laugh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;What is the matter, Mr.
Underhill?&quot; The alert mechan­ical must have perceived his shuddering
illness. &quot;Are you unwell?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;No, there's nothing the matter with
me,&quot; he gasped desperately. &quot;I've just found out that I'm perfectly
happy, under the Prime Directive. Everything is absolutely won­derful.&quot;
His voice came dry and hoarse and wild. &quot;You won't have to operate on
me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'>The car turned off the shining avenue,
taking him back to the quiet splendor of his home. His futile hands clenched
and relaxed again, folded on his knees. There was nothing left to do.</span></p>
