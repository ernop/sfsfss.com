let the towns go dry-shod in their sunshine, and let the farmers enjoy their
needed rain. As a general thing, that has always been the<b> </b>real as well
as the ideal case. There are records to confirm this. Cities do have (from the
viewpoint of cities) more pleasant weather than do the countrysides: milder in
summer, milder in winter also, dryer most times, and more sunny and more smiling
than country places. This is because, in the cities, there are greater numbers
of minds working for fine weather. The people of a town, by their desires and
sympathies, can literally hold an umbrella over a town and protect it from
inclement weather. But in the country there is need for great falls of rain and
for, ah, sometimes showers of proteid matter also.”</span></p>

the furniture of the Church from the beginning,” George Drakos commented. They
have always been effective, but perhaps they were more effective when the

been broken by the fervent prayers of the peoples.”</span></p>

Barnaby said. “But I will doubt the efficacy of this weather-making
pseudo-science that has been shoveled into tender children’s minds by certain
mentors. And I doubt the efficacy of the little fetish magic that the children
themselves contribute to it.”</span></p>

a form of prayer,” Cris said. “And both prayer and fetish magic have scientific

heaven, and even in the form of bread and fish from heaven.” ,</span></p>

man. And they defer to each other. One of them will give a listless
presentation on the evening that the other one gives a passionate show: and the
sense of the situation goes out to the people. With a good-weather feel in the
