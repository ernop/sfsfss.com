<p>s we look back at the century that&rsquo;s just ended,
it&rsquo;s obvious that Australian writer Greg Egan was one of the
big new names to emerge in SF in the nineties, and is probably one of
the most significant talents to enter the field in the last several
decades. Already one of the most widely known of all Australian genre
writers, Egan may well be the best new
&ldquo;hard-science&rdquo; writer to enter the field since Greg
Bear, and he is still growing in range, power, and sophistication. In
the last few years, he has become a frequent contributor to <em>Interzone</em>
and <em>Asimov&rsquo;s Science Fiction,</em> and has
made sales as well to <em>Pulphouse, Analog, Aurealis, Eidolon,</em>
and elsewhere; many of his stories have also appeared in various Best
of the Year series, and he was on the Hugo Final Ballot in 1995 for his
story &ldquo;Cocoon,&rdquo; which won the Ditmar Award and the
Asimov&rsquo;s Readers Award. He won the Hugo Award in 1999 for his
novella &ldquo;Oceanic.&rdquo; His first novel, <em>Quarantine,</em>
appeared in 1992; his second novel, <em>Permutation City,</em>
won the John W. Campbell Me&shy;morial Award in 1994. His other
books include the novels <em>Distress, Diaspora,</em> and <em>Teranesia,</em>
and three collections of his short fiction, <em>Axiomatic,
Luminous,</em> and <em>Our Lady of Chernobyl.</em>
His most recent book is the novel <em>Schild&rsquo;s
Lad&shy;der,</em> and he is at work on a new novel. He has a
website at http://www. netspace.netau/^gregegan/.</p>

<p>Egan has pictured galaxy-spanning civilizations in stories
such as &ldquo;Bor&shy;der Guards&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Riding the Crocodile.&rdquo; Here he sweeps us along
with scientists who are willing to go to enormous lengths (including
changing their species!) and travel across the galaxy in order to
investigate a scientific mystery&mdash;one that inimical forces
don&rsquo;t want them to solve.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>1</p>

<p>An ingot of metallic hydrogen gleamed in the starlight, a
narrow cylin&shy;der half a meter long with a mass of about a
kilogram. To the naked eye it was a dense, solid object, but its
lattice of tiny nuclei immersed in an insub&shy;stantial fog of
electrons was one part matter to two hundred trillion parts empty
space. A short distance away was a second ingot, apparently identical
to the first, but composed of antihydrogen.</p>

<p>A sequence of finely tuned gamma rays flooded into both
cylinders. The protons that absorbed them in the first ingot spat out
positrons and were transformed into neutrons, breaking their bonds to
the electron cloud that glued them in place. In the second ingot,
antiprotons became antineutrons.</p>

<p>A further sequence of pulses herded the neutrons together and
forged them into clusters; the antineutrons were similarly rearranged.
Both kinds of cluster were unstable, but in order to fall apart they
first had to pass through a quantum state that would have strongly
absorbed a component of the gamma rays constantly raining down on them.
Left to themselves, the probability of their being in this state would
have increased rapidly, but each time they measurably failed to absorb
the gamma rays, the probability fell back to zero. The quantum Zeno
effect endlessly reset the clock, holding the decay in check.</p>

<p>The next series of pulses began shifting the clusters into the
space that had separated the original ingots. First neutrons, then
antineutrons, were sculpted together in alternating layers. Though the
clusters were ultimately unstable, while they persisted they were
inert, sequestering their constitu&shy;ents and preventing them
from annihilating their counterparts. The end point of this process of
nuclear sculpting was a sliver of compressed matter and antimatter,
sandwiched together into a needle one micron wide.</p>

<p>The gamma ray lasers shut down, the Zeno effect withdrew its
prohibi&shy;tions. For the time it took a beam of light to cross a
neutron, the needle sat motionless in space. Then it began to burn, and
it began to move.</p>

<p>The needle was structured like a meticulously crafted
firework, and its outer layers ignited first. No external casing could
have channeled this blast, but the pattern of tensions woven into the
needle&rsquo;s construction favored one direction for the debris to
be expelled. Particles streamed backward; the needle moved forward. The
shock of acceleration could not have been borne by anything built from
atomic-scale matter, but the pressure bearing down on the core of the
needle prolonged its life, delaying the inevitable.</p>

<p>Layer after layer burned itself away, blasting the dwindling
remnant for&shy;ward ever faster. By the time the needle had shrunk
to a tenth of its original size it was moving at ninety-eight percent
of light-speed; to a bystander this could scarcely have been improved
upon, but from the needle&rsquo;s perspective there was still room
to slash its journey&rsquo;s duration by orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>When just one thousandth of the needle remained, its time,
compared to the neighboring stars, was passing two thousand times more
slowly. Still the layers kept burning, the protective clusters
unraveling as the pressure on them was released. The needle could only
reach close enough to light-speed to slow down time as much as it
required if it could sacrifice a large enough proportion of its
remaining mass. The core of the needle could survive only for a few
trillionths of a second, while its journey would take two hundred
million seconds as judged by the stars. The proportions had been
carefully matched, though: out of the two kilograms of matter and
antimatter that had been woven together at the launch, only a few
million neutrons were needed as the final payload.</p>

<p>By one measure, seven years passed. For the needle, its last
trillionths of a second unwound, its final layers of fuel blew away,
and at the moment its core was ready to explode it reached its
destination, plunging from the near-vacuum of space straight into the
heart of a star.</p>

<p>Even here, the density of matter was insufficient to stabilize
the core, yet far too high to allow it to pass unhindered. The core was
torn apart. But it did not go quietly, and the shock waves it carved
through the fusing plasma endured for a million kilometers: all the way
through to the cooler outer layers on the opposite side of the star.
These shock waves were shaped by the payload that had formed them, and
though the initial pattern imprinted on them by the disintegrating
cluster of neutrons was enlarged and blurred by its journey, on an
atomic scale it remained sharply defined. Like a mold stamped into the
seething plasma it encouraged ionized molecular fragments to slip into
the troughs and furrows that matched their shape, and then brought them
together to react in ways that the plasma&rsquo;s random collisions
would never have allowed. In effect, the shock waves formed a web of
catalysts, carefully laid out in both time and space, briefly
transforming a small corner of the star into a chemical factory
operating on a nanometer scale.</p>

<p>The products of this factory sprayed out of the star, riding
the last traces of the shock wave&rsquo;s momentum: a few nanograms
of elaborate, carbon-rich molecules, sheathed in a protective fullerene
weave. Traveling at seven hun&shy;dred kilometers per second, a
fraction below the velocity needed to escape from the star completely,
they climbed out of its gravity well, slowing as they ascended.</p>

<p>Four years passed, but the molecules were stable against the
ravages of space. By the time they&rsquo;d traveled a billion
kilometers they had almost come to a halt, and they would have fallen
back to die in the fires of the star that had forged them if their
journey had not been timed so that the star&rsquo;s third planet, a
gas giant, was waiting to urge them forward. As they fell toward it,
the giant&rsquo;s third moon moved across their path. Eleven years
after the nee&shy;dle&rsquo;s launch, its molecular offspring
rained down onto the methane snow.</p>

<p>The tiny heat of their impact was not enough to damage them,
but it melted a microscopic puddle in the snow. Surrounded by food, the
molecu&shy;lar seeds began to grow. Within hours, the area was
teeming with nanomachines, some mining the snow and the minerals
beneath it, others assembling the bounty into an intricate structure, a
rectangular panel a couple of meters wide.</p>

<p>From across the light-years, an elaborate sequence of gamma
ray pulses fell upon the panel. These pulses were the
needle&rsquo;s true payload, the passen&shy;gers for whom it
had merely prepared the way, transmitted in its wake four years after
its launch. The panel decoded and stored the data, and the army of
nanomachines set to work again, this time following a far more
elaborate blueprint. The miners were forced to look farther afield to
find all the ele&shy;ments that were needed, while the assemblers
labored to reach their goal through a sequence of intermediate stages,
carefully designed to protect the final product from the vagaries of
the local chemistry and climate.</p>

<p>After three months&rsquo; work, two small fusion-powered
spacecraft sat in the snow. Each one held a single occupant, waking for
the first time in their freshly minted bodies, yet endowed with
memories of an earlier life.</p>

<p>Joan switched on her communications console. Anne appeared on
the screen, three short pairs of arms folded across her thorax in a
posture of calm repose. They had both worn virtual bodies with the same
anatomy before, but this was the first time they had become Noudah in
the flesh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here. Everything worked,&rdquo;
Joan marveled. The language she spoke was not her own, but the
structure of her new brain and body made it second nature.</p>

<p>Anne said, &ldquo;Now comes the hard part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Joan looked out from the
spacecraft&rsquo;s cockpit. In the distance, a fissured blue-gray
plateau of water ice rose above the snow. Nearby, the nanomachines were
busy disassembling the gamma ray receiver. When they had erased all
traces of their handiwork they would wander off into the snow and
catalyze their own destruction.</p>

<p>Joan had visited dozens of planet-bound cultures in the past,
taking on different bodies and languages as necessary, but those
cultures had all been plugged into the Amalgam, the metacivilization
that spanned the galactic disk. However far from home she&rsquo;d
been, the means to return to familiar places had always been close at
hand. The Noudah had only just mastered interplanetary flight, and they
had no idea that the Amalgam existed. The closest node in the
Amalgam&rsquo;s network was seven light-years away, and even that
was out of bounds to her and Anne now: they had agreed not to risk
disclosing its location to the Noudah, so any transmission they sent
could be directed only to a decoy node that they&rsquo;d set up
more than twenty light-years away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be worth it,&rdquo; Joan said.</p>

<p>Anne&rsquo;s Noudah face was immobile, but chromatophores
sent a wave of violet and gold sweeping across her skin in an
expression of cautious op&shy;timism. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
see.&rdquo; She tipped her head to the left, a gesture preceding a
friendly departure.</p>

<p>Joan tipped her own head in response, as if she&rsquo;d
been doing so all her life. &ldquo;Be careful, my
friend,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne&rsquo;s ship ascended so high on its chemical
thrusters that it shrank to a speck before igniting its fusion engine
and streaking away in a blaze of light. Joan felt a pang of loneliness;
there was no predicting when they would be reunited.</p>

<p>Her ship&rsquo;s software was primitive; the whole machine
had been scru&shy;pulously matched to the Noudah&rsquo;s level
of technology. Joan knew how to fly it herself if necessary, and on a
whim she switched off the autopilot and manually activated the ascent
thrusters. The control panel was crowded, but having six hands helped.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>The world the Noudah called home was the closest of the
system&rsquo;s five planets to their sun. The average temperature
was one hundred and twenty degrees Celsius, but the high atmospheric
pressure allowed liquid water to exist across the entire surface. The
chemistry and dynamics of the plan&shy;et&rsquo;s crust had led
to a relatively flat terrain, with a patchwork of dozens of
disconnected seas but no globe-spanning ocean. From space, these seas
appeared as silvery mirrors, bordered by a violet and brown tarnish of
veg&shy;etation.</p>

<p>The Noudah were already leaving their most electromagnetically
pro&shy;miscuous phase of communications behind, but the
short-lived oasis of Amalgam-level technology on Baneth, the gas
giant&rsquo;s moon, had had no trouble eavesdropping on their
chatter and preparing an updated cultural briefing which had been
spliced into Joan&rsquo;s brain.</p>

<p>The planet was still divided into the same eleven political
units as it had been fourteen years before, the time of the last
broadcasts that had reached the node before Joan&rsquo;s departure.
Tira and Ghahar, the two dominant na&shy;tions in terms of
territory, economic activity, and military power, also
oc&shy;cupied the vast majority of significant Niah archaeological
sites.</p>

<p>Joan had expected that they&rsquo;d be noticed as soon as
they left Baneth&mdash;the exhaust from their fusion engines glowed
like the sun&mdash;but their departure had triggered no obvious
response, and now that they were coasting they&rsquo;d be far
harder to spot. As Anne drew closer to the homeworld, she sent a
message to Tira&rsquo;s traffic control center. Joan tuned in to
the exchange.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I come in peace from another star,&rdquo; Anne
said. &ldquo;I seek permission to land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a delay of several seconds more than the light-speed
lag, then a terse response. &ldquo;Please identify yourself and
state your location.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne transmitted her coordinates and flight plan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We confirm your location, please identify
yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Anne. I come from another
star.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a long pause, then a different voice answered.
&ldquo;If you are from Ghahar, please explain your
intentions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not from Ghahar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I believe that? Show yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken the same shape as your people,
in the hope of living among you for a while.&rdquo; Anne opened a
video channel and showed them her un&shy;remarkable Noudah face.
&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s a signal being transmitted from these
coordinates that might persuade you that I&rsquo;m telling the
truth.&rdquo; She gave the location of the decoy node, twenty
light-years away, and specified a fre&shy;quency. The signal coming
from the node contained an image of the very same face.</p>

<p>This time, the silence stretched out for several minutes. It
would take a while for the Tirans to confirm the true distance of the
radio source.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not have permission to land. Please enter
this orbit, and we will rendezvous and board your ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Parameters for the orbit came through on the data channel.
Anne said, &ldquo;As you wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Minutes later, Joan&rsquo;s instruments picked up three
fusion ships being launched from Tiran bases. When Anne reached the
prescribed orbit, Joan listened anxiously to the instructions the
Tirans issued. Their tone sounded wary, but they were entitled to treat
this stranger with caution, all the more so if they believed
Anne&rsquo;s claim.</p>

<p>Joan was accustomed to a very different kind of reception, but
then the members of the Amalgam had spent hundreds of millennia
establishing a framework of trust. They also benefited from a milieu in
which most kinds of force had been rendered ineffectual; when everyone
had backups of themselves scattered around the galaxy, it required a
vastly disproportion&shy;ate effort to inconvenience someone, let
alone kill them. By any reasonable measure, honesty and cooperation
yielded far richer rewards than subter&shy;fuge and slaughter.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, each individual culture had its roots in a
biological heritage that gave rise to behavior governed more by ancient
urges than contempo&shy;rary realities, and even when they mastered
the technology to choose their own nature, the precise set of traits
they preserved was up to them. In the worst case, a species still
saddled with inappropriate drives but empowered by advanced technology
could wreak havoc. The Noudah deserved to be treated with courtesy and
respect, but they did not yet belong in the Amalgam.</p>

<p>The Tirans&rsquo; own exchanges were not on open channels,
so once they had entered Anne&rsquo;s ship Joan could only guess at
what was happening. She waited until two of the ships had returned to
the surface, then sent her own message to Ghahar&rsquo;s traffic
control.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I come in peace from another star. I seek
permission to land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>The Ghahari allowed Joan to fly her ship straight down to the
surface. She wasn&rsquo;t sure if this was because they were more
trusting, or if they were afraid that the Tirans might try to interfere
if she lingered in orbit.</p>

<p>The landing site was a bare plain of chocolate-colored sand.
The air shimmered in the heat, the distortions intensified by the
thickness of the atmosphere, making the horizon waver as if seen
through molten glass. Joan waited in the cockpit as three trucks
approached; they all came to a halt some twenty meters away. A voice
over the radio instructed her to leave the ship; she complied, and
after she&rsquo;d stood in the open for a minute, a lone Noudah
left one of the trucks and walked toward her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Pirit,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Welcome to Ghahar.&rdquo; Her gestures were courteous
but restrained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Joan. Thank you for your
hospitality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your impersonation of our biology is
impeccable.&rdquo; There was a trace of skepticism in
Pirit&rsquo;s tone; Joan had pointed the Ghahari to her own
portrait being broadcast from the decoy node, but she had to admit that
in the con&shy;text her lack of exotic technology and traits would
make it harder to accept the implications of that transmission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my culture, it&rsquo;s a matter of courtesy
to imitate one&rsquo;s hosts as closely as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pirit hesitated, as if pondering whether to debate the merits
of such a custom, but then rather than quibbling over the niceties of
interspecies eti&shy;quette she chose to confront the real issue
head-on. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a Tiran spy, or a defector, the
sooner you admit that the better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very sensible advice, but
I&rsquo;m neither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Noudah wore no clothing as such, but Pirit had a belt with
a number of pouches. She took a handheld scanner from one and ran it
over Joan&rsquo;s body. Joan&rsquo;s briefing suggested that it
was probably only checking for metal, volatile explosives, and
radiation; the technology to image her body or search for pathogens
would not be so portable. In any case, she was a healthy, unarmed
Noudah down to the molecular level.</p>

<p>Pirit escorted her to one of the trucks, and invited her to
recline in a section at the back. Another Noudah drove while Pirit
watched over Joan. They soon arrived at a small complex of buildings a
couple of kilometers from where the ship had touched down. The walls,
roofs, and floors of the buildings were all made from the local sand,
cemented with an adhesive that the Noudah secreted from their own
bodies.</p>

<p>Inside, Joan was given a thorough medical examination,
including three kinds of full-body scan. The Noudah who examined her
treated her with a kind of detached efficiency devoid of any
pleasantries; she wasn&rsquo;t sure if that was their standard
bedside manner, or a kind of glazed shock at having been told of her
claimed origins.</p>

<p>Pirit took her to an adjoining room and offered her a couch.
The Noudah anatomy did not allow for sitting, but they liked to recline.</p>

<p>Pirit remained standing. &ldquo;How did you come
here?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen my ship. I flew it from
Baneth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how did you reach Baneth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not free to discuss that,&rdquo;
Joan replied cheerfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not free?&rdquo; Pirit&rsquo;s face clouded
with silver, as if she were genuinely per&shy;plexed.</p>

<p>Joan said, &ldquo;You understand me perfectly. Please
don&rsquo;t tell me there&rsquo;s noth&shy;ing <em>you&rsquo;re</em>
not free to discuss with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You certainly didn&rsquo;t fly that ship twenty
light-years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I certainly didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pirit hesitated. &ldquo;Did you come through the
Cataract?&rdquo; The Cataract was a black hole, a remote partner to
the Noudah&rsquo;s sun; they orbited each other at a distance of
about eighty billion kilometers. The name came from its telescopic
appearance: a dark circle ringed by a distortion in the
back&shy;ground of stars, like some kind of visual aberration. The
Tirans and Ghahari were in a race to be the first to visit this
extraordinary neighbor, but as yet neither of them were quite up to the
task.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Through</em> the Cataract? I think
your scientists have already proven that black holes aren&rsquo;t
shortcuts to anywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our scientists aren&rsquo;t always
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither are ours,&rdquo; Joan admitted,
&ldquo;but all the evidence points in one direction: black holes
aren&rsquo;t doorways, they&rsquo;re shredding
machines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you traveled the whole twenty
light-years?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than that,&rdquo; Joan said truthfully
&ldquo;from my original home. I&rsquo;ve spent half my life
traveling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faster than light?&rdquo; Pirit suggested
hopefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. That&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They circled around the question a dozen more times, before
Pirit finally changed her tune from <em>how</em> to <em>why?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a xenomathematician,&rdquo; Joan
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come here in the hope of collaborating
with your archaeologists in their study of Niah artifacts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pirit was stunned. &ldquo;What do you know about the
Niah?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not as much as I&rsquo;d like to.&rdquo;
Joan gestured at her Noudah body. &ldquo;As I&rsquo;m sure
you&rsquo;ve already surmised, we&rsquo;ve listened to your
broadcasts for some time, so we know pretty much what an ordinary
Noudah knows. That in&shy;cludes the basic facts about the Niah.
Historically they&rsquo;ve been referred to as your ancestors,
though the latest studies suggest that you and they really just have an
earlier common ancestor. They died out about a million years ago, but
there&rsquo;s evidence that they might have had a sophisticated
culture for as long as three million years. There&rsquo;s no
indication that they ever developed space flight. Basically, once they
achieved material comfort, they seem to have devoted themselves to
various art forms, including mathematics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve traveled twenty light-years
just to look at Niah tablets?&rdquo; Pirit was incredulous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any culture that spent three million years doing
mathematics must have something to teach us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Pirit&rsquo;s face became
blue with disgust. &ldquo;In the ten thousand years since we
discovered the wheel, we&rsquo;ve already reached halfway to the
Cataract. They wasted their time on useless abstractions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joan said, &ldquo;I come from a culture of spacefarers
myself, so I respect your achievements. But I don&rsquo;t think
anyone really knows what the Niah achieved. I&rsquo;d like to find
out, with the help of your people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pirit was silent for a while. &ldquo;What if we say
no?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll leave empty-handed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if we insist that you remain with
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll die here,
empty-handed.&rdquo; On her command, this body would expire in an
instant; she could not be held and tortured.</p>

<p>Pirit said angrily, &ldquo;You must be willing to trade <em>something</em>
for the privilege you&rsquo;re demanding!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Requesting, not demanding,&rdquo; Joan insisted
gently. &ldquo;And what I&rsquo;m will&shy;ing to offer is
my own culture&rsquo;s perspective on Niah mathematics. If you ask
your archaeologists and mathematicians, I&rsquo;m sure
they&rsquo;ll tell you that there are many things written in the
Niah tablets that they don&rsquo;t yet understand. My colleague and
I&rdquo;&mdash;neither of them had mentioned Anne before, but
Joan was sure that Pirit knew all about her&mdash;&ldquo;simply
want to shed as much light as we can on this subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pirit said bitterly, &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t even tell
us how you came to our world. Why should we trust you to share whatever
you discover about the Niah?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Interstellar travel is no great mystery,&rdquo;
Joan countered. &ldquo;You know all the basic science already;
making it work is just a matter of persistence. If you&rsquo;re
left to develop your own technology, you might even come up with better
methods than we have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;re expected to be patient, to
discover these things for ourselves&hellip; but you can&rsquo;t
wait a few centuries for us to decipher the Niah artifacts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joan said bluntly, &ldquo;The present Noudah culture, both
here and in Tira, seems to hold the Niah in contempt. Dozens of
partially excavated sites containing Niah artifacts are under threat
from irrigation projects and other developments. That&rsquo;s the
reason we couldn&rsquo;t wait. We needed to come here and offer our
assistance, before the last traces of the Niah disappeared
for&shy;ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pirit did not reply, but Joan hoped she knew what her
interrogator was thinking: <em>Nobody would cross twenty
light-years for a few worthless scribblings. Perhaps we&rsquo;ve
underestimated the Niah. Perhaps our ancestors have left us a great
secret, a great legacy. And perhaps the fastest</em>&mdash;<em>perhaps
the only</em>&mdash;<em>way to uncover it is to give
this impertinent, irritating alien exactly what she wants.</em></p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>The sun was rising ahead of them as they reached the top of
the hill. Sando turned to Joan, and his face became green with
pleasure. &ldquo;Look behind you,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Joan did as he asked. The valley below was hidden in fog, and
it had set&shy;tled so evenly that she could see their shadows in
the dawn light, stretched out across the top of the fog layer. Around
the shadow of her head was a circular halo like a small rainbow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We call it the Niah&rsquo;s light,&rdquo;
Sando said. &ldquo;In the old days, people used to say that the
halo proved that the Niah blood was strong in you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joan said, &ldquo;The only trouble with that hypothesis
being that <em>you</em> see it around <em>your</em>
head&hellip;and I see it around mine.&rdquo; On Earth, the
phenomenon was known as a &ldquo;glory.&rdquo; The particles of
fog were scattering the sunlight back toward them, turning it one
hundred and eighty degrees. To look at the shadow of your own head was
to face directly away from the sun, so the halo always appeared around
the observers shadow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re the final proof that
Niah blood has nothing to do with it,&rdquo; Sando mused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s assuming I&rsquo;m telling you
the truth, and I really can see it around my own head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And assuming,&rdquo; Sando added,
&ldquo;that the Niah really did stay at home, and didn&rsquo;t
wander around the galaxy spreading their progeny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They came over the top of the hill and looked down into the
adjoining riverine valley. The sparse brown grass of the hillside gave
way to a lush violet growth closer to the water. Joan&rsquo;s
arrival had delayed the flooding of the valley, but even alien interest
in the Niah had only bought the ar&shy;chaeologists an extra year.
The dam was part of a long-planned agricultural development, and
however tantalizing the possibility that Joan might reveal some
priceless insight hidden among the Niah&rsquo;s &ldquo;useless
abstractions,&rdquo; that vague promise could only compete with
more tangible considerations for a limited time.</p>

<p>Part of the hill had fallen away in a landslide a few
centuries before, revealing more than a dozen beautifully preserved
strata. When Joan and Sando reached the excavation site, Rali and Surat
were already at work, clearing away soft sedimentary rock from a layer
that Sando had dated as belonging to the Niah&rsquo;s
&ldquo;twilight&rdquo; period.</p>

<p>Pirit had insisted that only Sando, the senior archaeologist,
be told about Joan&rsquo;s true nature; Joan refused to lie to
anyone, but had agreed to tell her colleagues only that she was a
mathematician and that she was not permit&shy;ted to discuss her
past. At first this had made them guarded and resentful, no doubt
because they assumed that she was some kind of spy sent by the
authorities to watch over them. Later it had dawned on them that she
was genuinely interested in their work, and that the absurd
restrictions on her topics of conversation were not of her own
choosing. Nothing about the Noudah&rsquo;s language or appearance
correlated strongly with their recent divi&shy;sion into
nations&mdash;with no oceans to cross, and a long history of
migration they were more or less geographically
homogeneous&mdash;but Joan&rsquo;s odd name and occasional faux
pas could still be ascribed to some mysterious exoti&shy;cism. Rali
and Surat seemed content to assume that she was a defector from one of
the smaller nations, and that her history could not be made explicit
for obscure political reasons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are more tablets here, very close to the
surface,&rdquo; Rali announced excitedly. &ldquo;The acoustics
are unmistakable.&rdquo; Ideally they would have exca&shy;vated
the entire hillside, but they did not have the time or the labor, so
they were using acoustic tomography to identify likely deposits of
accessible Niah writing, and then concentrating their efforts on those
spots.</p>

<p>The Niah had probably had several ephemeral forms of written
commu&shy;nication, but when they found something worth publishing,
it stayed pub&shy;lished: they carved their symbols into a ceramic
that made diamond seem like tissue paper. It was almost unheard of for
the tablets to be broken, but they were small, and multitablet works
were sometimes widely dispersed. Niah technology could probably have
carved three million years&rsquo; worth of knowledge onto the head
of a pin&mdash;they seemed not to have invented nanomachines, but
they were into high-quality bulk materials and precision
engineering&mdash;but for whatever reason they had chosen
legibility to the naked eye above other considerations.</p>

<p>Joan made herself useful, taking acoustic readings farther
along the slope, while Sando watched over his students as they came
closer to the buried Niah artifacts. She had learned not to hover
around expectantly when a discovery was imminent; she was treated far
more warmly if she waited to be summoned. The tomography unit was
almost foolproof, using satellite navigation to track its position and
software to analyze the signals it gath&shy;ered; all it really
needed was someone to drag it along the rock face at a suitable pace.</p>

<p>From the corner of her eye, Joan noticed her shadow on the
rocks flicker and grow complicated. She looked up to see three dazzling
beads of light flying west out of the sun. She might have assumed that
the fusion ships were doing something useful, but the media was full of
talk of &ldquo;military exercises,&rdquo; which meant the
Tirans and the Ghahari were engaging in ex&shy;pensive, belligerent
gestures in orbit, trying to convince each other of their superior
skills, technology, or sheer strength of numbers. For people with no
real differences apart from a few centuries of recent history, they
could puff up their minor political disputes into matters of the utmost
solemnity. It might almost have been funny, if the idiots
hadn&rsquo;t incinerated hundreds of thousands of each
other&rsquo;s citizens every few decades, not to mention playing
callous and often deadly games with the lives of the inhabitants of
smaller nations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jown! Jown! Come and look at this!&rdquo; Surat
called to her. Joan switched off the tomography unit and jogged toward
the archaeologists, suddenly conscious of her body&rsquo;s
strangeness. Her legs were stumpy but strong, and her balance as she
ran came not from arms and shoulders but from the swish of her muscular
tail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a significant mathematical
result,&rdquo; Rali informed her proudly when she reached them.
He&rsquo;d pressure-washed the sandstone away from the
near-indestructible ceramic of the tablet, and it was only a matter of
holding the surface at the right angle to the light to see the etched
writing stand out as crisply and starkly as it would have a million
years before.</p>

<p>Rali was not a mathematician, and he was not offering his own
opin&shy;ion on the theorem the tablet stated; the Niah themselves
had had a clear set of typographical conventions which they used to
distinguish between everything from minor lemmas to the most celebrated
theorems. The size and decorations of the symbols labeling the theorem
attested to its value in the Niah&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>Joan read the theorem carefully. The proof was not included on
the same tablet, but the Niah had a way of expressing their results
that made you believe them as soon as you read them; in this case the
definitions of the terms needed to state the theorem were so
beautifully chosen that the result seemed almost inevitable.</p>

<p>The theorem itself was expressed as a commuting hypercube, one
of the Niah&rsquo;s favorite forms. You could think of a square
with four different sets of mathematical objects associated with each
of its corners, and a way of mapping one set into another associated
with each edge of the square. If the maps commuted, then going across
the top of the square, then down, had exactly the same effect as going
down the left edge of the square, then across: either way, you mapped
each element from the top-left set into the same element of the
bottom-right set. A similar kind of result might hold for sets and maps
that could naturally be placed at the corners and edges of a cube, or a
hypercube of any dimension. It was also possible for the square faces
in these structures to stand for relationships that held between the
maps between sets, and for cubes to describe relationships between
those relationships, and so on.</p>

<p>That a theorem took this form didn&rsquo;t guarantee its
importance; it was easy to cook up trivial examples of sets and maps
that commuted. The Niah didn&rsquo;t carve trivia into their
timeless ceramic, though, and this theorem was no exception. The
seven-dimensional commuting hypercube established a dazzlingly elegant
correspondence between seven distinct, major branches of Niah
mathematics, intertwining their most important concepts into a unified
whole. It was a result Joan had never seen before: no mathematician
anywhere in the Amalgam, or in any ancestral culture she had studied,
had reached the same insight.</p>

<p>She explained as much of this as she could to the three
archaeologists; they couldn&rsquo;t take in all the details, but
their faces became orange with fas&shy;cination when she sketched
what she thought the result would have meant to the Niah themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t quite the Big
Crunch,&rdquo; she joked, &ldquo;but it must have made them
think they were getting closer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Big Crunch&rdquo; was her nickname for the
mythical result that the Niah had aspired to reach: a unification of
every field of mathematics that they considered significant. To find
such a thing would not have meant the end of mathematics&mdash;it
would not have subsumed every last conceivable, interesting
mathematical truth&mdash;but it would certainly have marked a point
of closure for the Niah&rsquo;s own style of investigation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they found it,&rdquo; Surat
insisted. &ldquo;They reached the Big Crunch, then they had nothing
more to live for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rali was scathing. &ldquo;So the whole culture committed
collective suicide?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not actively, no,&rdquo; Surat replied.
&ldquo;But it was the search that had kept them going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Entire cultures don&rsquo;t lose the will to
live,&rdquo; Rali said. &ldquo;They get wiped out by external
forces: disease, invasion, changes in climate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Niah survived for three million
years,&rdquo; Surat countered. &ldquo;They had the means to
weather all of those forces. Unless they were wiped out by alien
invaders with vastly superior technology.&rdquo; She turned to
Joan. &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About aliens destroying the Niah?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was joking about the aliens. But what about the
mathematics? What if they found the Big Crunch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more to life than
mathematics,&rdquo; Joan said. &ldquo;But not much
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sando said, &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s more to this find
than one tablet. If we get back to work, we might have the proof in our
hands before sunset.&rdquo;</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>5</p>

<p>Joan briefed Halzoun by video link while Sando prepared the
evening meal. Halzoun was the mathematician Pirit had appointed to
supervise her, but apparently his day job was far too important to
allow him to travel. Joan was grateful; Halzoun was the most tedious
Noudah she had encountered. He could understand the Niah&rsquo;s
work when she explained it to him, but he seemed to have no interest in
it for its own sake. He spent most of their conversations trying to
catch her out in some deception or contradiction, and the rest pressing
her to imagine military or commercial applications of the
Niah&rsquo;s gloriously useless insights. Sometimes she played
along with this infantile fantasy, hinting at potential superweapons
based on exotic physics that might come tumbling out of the vacuum, if
only one possessed the right Niah theorems to coax them into existence.</p>

<p>Sando was her minder too, but at least he was more subtle
about it. Pirit had insisted that she stay in his shelter, rather than
sharing Rali and Surat&rsquo;s; Joan didn&rsquo;t mind, because
with Sando she didn&rsquo;t have the stress of having to keep quiet
about everything. Privacy and modesty were nonissues for the Noudah,
and Joan had become Noudah enough not to care herself. Nor was there
any danger of their proximity leading to a sexual bond; the Noudah had
a complex system of biochemical cues that meant desire only arose in
couples with a suitable mixture of genetic differences and
similari&shy;ties. She would have had to search a crowded Noudah
city for a week to find someone to lust after, though at least it would
have been guaranteed to be mutual.</p>

<p>After they&rsquo;d eaten, Sando said, &ldquo;You
should be happy. That was our best find yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am happy.&rdquo; Joan made a conscious effort
to exhibit a viridian tinge. &ldquo;It was the first new result
I&rsquo;ve seen on this planet. It was the reason I came here, the
reason I traveled so far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong, though, I
think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could have shared the news with my
friend,&rdquo; Joan admitted. Pirit claimed to be negotiating with
the Tirans to allow Anne to commu&shy;nicate with her, but Joan was
not convinced that she was genuinely trying.</p>

<p>She was sure that Pirit would have relished the thought of
listening in on a conversation between the two of them&mdash;while
forcing them to speak Noudah, of course&mdash;in the hope that
they&rsquo;d slip up and reveal something useful, but at the same
time she would have had to face the fact that the Tirans would be
listening too. What an excruciating dilemma.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have brought a communications link with
you,&rdquo; Sando sug&shy;gested. &ldquo;A home-style one,
I mean. Nothing we could eavesdrop on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; Joan said.</p>

<p>He pondered this. &ldquo;You really are afraid of us,
aren&rsquo;t you? You think the smallest technological trinket will
be enough to send us straight to the stars, and then you&rsquo;ll
have a horde of rampaging barbarians to deal with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know how to deal with barbarians,&rdquo;
Joan said coolly.</p>

<p>Sando&rsquo;s face grew dark with mirth. &ldquo;Now <em>I&rsquo;m</em>
afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just wish I knew what was happening to
her,&rdquo; Joan said. &ldquo;What she was doing, how they were
treating her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably much the same as we&rsquo;re treating
you,&rdquo; Sando suggested. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re really not
that different.&rdquo; He thought for a moment. &ldquo;There
was something I wanted to show you.&rdquo; He brought over his
portable console, and sum&shy;moned up an article from a Tiran
journal. &ldquo;See what a borderless world we live in,&rdquo;
he joked.</p>

<p>The article was entitled &ldquo;Seekers and Spreaders:
What We Must Learn from the Niah.&rdquo; Sando said,
&ldquo;This might give you some idea of how they&rsquo;re
thinking over there. Jaqad is an academic archaeologist, but
she&rsquo;s also very close to the people in power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joan read from the console while Sando made repairs to their
shelter, secreting a molasseslike substance from a gland at the tip of
his tail and spreading it over the cracks in the walls.</p>

<p>There were two main routes a culture could take, Jaqad argued,
once it satisfied its basic material needs. One was to think and study:
to stand back and observe, to seek knowledge and insight from the world
around it. The other was to invest its energy in entrenching its good
fortune.</p>

<p>The Niah had learned a great deal in three million years, but
in the end it had not been enough to save them. Exactly what had killed
them was still a matter of speculation, but it was hard to believe that
if they had colonized other worlds they would have vanished on all of
them. &ldquo;Had the Niah been Spreaders,&rdquo; Jaqad wrote,
&ldquo;we might expect a visit from them, or them from us, sometime
in the coming centuries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Noudah, in contrast, were determined Spreaders. Once they
had the means, they would plant colonies across the galaxy. They would,
Jaqad was sure, create new biospheres, reengineer stars, and even alter
space and time to guarantee their survival. The growth of their empire
would come first; any knowledge that failed to serve that purpose would
be a mere dis&shy;traction. &ldquo;In any competition between
Seekers and Spreaders, it is a Law of History that the Spreaders must
win out in the end. Seekers, such as the Niah, might hog resources and
block the way, but in the long run their own nature will be their
downfall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joan stopped reading. &ldquo;When you look out into the
galaxy with your telescopes,&rdquo; she asked Sando, &ldquo;how
many <em>reengineered stars</em> do you see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would we recognize them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Natural stellar processes aren&rsquo;t
that complicated; your scientists al&shy;ready know everything
there is to know about the subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your word for that.
So&hellip; you&rsquo;re saying Jaqad is wrong? The Niah
themselves never left this world, but the galaxy already belongs to
creatures more like them than like us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Noudah versus Niah,&rdquo;
Joan said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matter of how a
culture&rsquo;s perspective changes with time. Once a species
conquers disease, modifies their biology, and spreads even a short
distance beyond their homeworld, they usually start to relax a bit. The
territorial imperative isn&rsquo;t some timeless Law of History; it
belongs to a certain phase.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if it persists, though? Into a later
phase?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That can cause friction,&rdquo; Joan admitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, no Spreaders have conquered the
galaxy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sando went back to his repairs; Joan read the rest of the
article. She&rsquo;d thought she&rsquo;d already grasped the
lesson demanded by the subtitle, but it turned out that Jaqad had
something more specific in mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Having argued this way, how can I defend my own
field of study from the very same charges as I have brought against the
Niah? Having grasped the essential character of this doomed race, why
should we waste our time and resources studying them further?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The answer is simple. We still do not know exactly
how and why the Niah died, but when we do, that could turn out to be
the most important discovery in history. When we finally leave our
world behind, we should not expect to find only other Spreaders to
compete with us, as honorable op&shy;ponents in battle. There will
be Seekers as well, blocking the way. Tired, old races squatting
uselessly on their hoards of knowledge and wealth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time will defeat them in the end, but we already
waited three million years to be born; we should have no patience to
wait again. If we can learn how the Niah died, that will be our key,
that will be our weapon. If we know the Seekers&rsquo; weakness, we
can find a way to hasten their demise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>6</p>

<p>The proof of the Niah&rsquo;s theorem turned out to be
buried deep in the hillside, but over the following days they extracted
it all.</p>

<p>It was as beautiful and satisfying as Joan could have wished,
merging six earlier, simpler theorems while extending the techniques
used in their proofs. She could even see hints of how the same methods
might be stretched further to yield still stronger results.
&ldquo;The Big Crunch&rdquo; had always been a slightly
mocking, irreverent term, but now she was struck anew by how little
justice it did to the real trend that had fascinated the Niah. It was
not a matter of everything in mathematics collapsing in on itself, with
one branch turning out to have been merely a recapitulation of another
under a different guise. Rather, the principle was that every
sufficiently beautiful mathematical system was rich enough to mirror <em>in
part</em>&mdash;and sometimes in a complex and distorted
fashion&mdash;every other sufficiently beautiful system. Nothing
became sterile and redundant, nothing proved to have been a waste of
time, but everything was shown to be magnificently intertwined.</p>

<p>After briefing Halzoun, Joan used the satellite dish to
transmit the theo&shy;rem and its proof to the decoy node. That had
been the deal with Pirit: anything she learned from the Niah belonged
to the whole galaxy, as long as she explained it to her hosts first.</p>

<p>The archaeologists moved across the hillside, hunting for more
artifacts in the same layer of sediment. Joan was eager to see what
else the same group of Niah might have published. One possible
eight-dimensional hypercube was hovering in her mind; if
she&rsquo;d sat down and thought about it for a few decades she
might have worked out the details herself, but the Niah did what they
did so well that it would have seemed crass to try to follow clumsily
in their footsteps when their own immaculately polished results might
simply be lying in the ground, waiting to be uncovered.</p>

<p>A month after the discovery, Joan was woken by the sound of an
intruder moving through the shelter. She knew it wasn&rsquo;t
Sando; even as she slept an ancient part of her Noudah brain was
listening to his heartbeat. The stranger&rsquo;s heart was too
quiet to hear, which required great discipline, but the
shelter&rsquo;s flexible adhesive made the floor emit a
characteristic squeak beneath even the gentlest footsteps. As she rose
from her couch she heard Sando waking, and she turned in his direction.</p>

<p>Bright torchlight on his face dazzled her for a moment. The
intruder held two knives to Sando&rsquo;s respiration membranes; a
deep enough cut there would mean choking to death, in excruciating
pain. The nanomachines that had built Joan&rsquo;s body had wired
extensive skills in unarmed combat into her brain, and one scenario
involving a feigned escape attempt followed by a sideways flick of her
powerful tail was already playing out in the back of her mind, but as
yet she could see no way to guarantee that Sando came through it all
unharmed.</p>

<p>She said, &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The intruder remained in darkness. &ldquo;Tell me about
the ship that brought you to Baneth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it would be a shame to shred your colleague
here, just when his work was going so well.&rdquo; Sando refused to
show any emotion on his face, but the blank pallor itself was as stark
an expression of fear as anything Joan could imagine.</p>

<p>She said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a coherent state that
can be prepared for a quark-gluon plasma in which virtual black holes
catalyze baryon decay. In effect, you can turn all of your
fuel&rsquo;s rest mass into photons, yielding the most efficient
exhaust stream possible.&rdquo; She recited a long list of
technical details. The claimed baryon decay process didn&rsquo;t
actually exist, but the pseudophysics underpinning it was
mathematically consistent, and could not be ruled out by anything the
Noudah had yet observed. She and Anne had prepared an entire fictitious
science and technology, and even a fictitious history of their culture,
precisely for emergencies like this; they could spout red herrings for
a decade if necessary, and never get caught out contradicting
themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t so hard, was it?&rdquo;
the intruder gloated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to take a trip with me. If
you do this nicely, nobody needs to get hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something moved in the shadows, and the intruder screamed in
pain. Joan leaped forward and knocked one of the knives out of his hand
with her tail; the other knife grazed Sando&rsquo;s membrane, but a
second tail whipped out of the darkness and intervened. As the intruder
fell backward, the beam of his torch revealed Surat and Rali tensed
beside him, and a pick buried deep in his side.</p>

<p>Joan&rsquo;s rush of combat hormones suddenly faded, and
she let out a long, deep wail of anguish. Sando was unscathed, but a
stream of dark liquid was pumping out of the intruder&rsquo;s wound.</p>

<p>Surat was annoyed. &ldquo;Stop blubbing, and help us tie
up this Tiran cousin-fucker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tie him up? You&rsquo;ve killed him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be stupid, that&rsquo;s just
sheath fluid.&rdquo; Joan recalled her Noudah anat&shy;omy;
sheath fluid was like oil in a hydraulic machine. You could lose it all
and it would cost you most of the strength in your limbs and tail, but
you wouldn&rsquo;t die, and your body would make more eventually.</p>

<p>Rali found some cable and they trussed up the intruder. Sando
was shaken, but he seemed to be recovering. He took Joan aside.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have to call Pirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand. But what will he do to these
two?&rdquo; She wasn&rsquo;t sure exactly how much Rali and
Surat had heard, but it was certain to have been more than Pirit wanted
them to know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that, I can protect
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just before dawn someone sent by Pirit arrived in a truck to
take the intruder away. Sando declared a rest day, and Rali and Surat
went back to their shelter to sleep. Joan went for a walk along the
hillside; she didn&rsquo;t feel like sleeping.</p>

<p>Sando caught up with her. He said, &ldquo;I told them
you&rsquo;d been working on a military research project, and you
were exiled here for some political misdemeanor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And they believed you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All they heard was half of a conversation full of
incomprehensible phys&shy;ics. All they know is that someone
thought you were worth kidnapping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joan said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about what
happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sando hesitated. &ldquo;What did you expect?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joan was stung. &ldquo;One of us went to Tira, one of us
came here. We thought that would keep everyone happy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re Spreaders,&rdquo; said Sando.
&ldquo;Give us one of anything, and we want two. Especially if our
enemy has the other one. Did you really think you could come here, do a
bit of fossicking, and then simply fly away without changing a
thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your culture has always believed there were other
civilizations in the galaxy. Our existence hardly came as a
shock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sando&rsquo;s face became yellow, an expression of almost
parental reproach. &ldquo;Believing in something in the abstract is
not the same as having it dangled in front of you. We were never going
to have an existential crisis at finding out that we&rsquo;re not
unique; the Niah might be related to us, but they were still alien
enough to get us used to the idea. But did you really think we were
just going to relax and accept your refusal to share your technology?
That one of you went to the Tirans only makes it worse for the Ghahari,
and vice versa. Both governments are going absolutely crazy, each one
ter&shy;rified that the other has found a way to make its alien
talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joan stopped walking. &ldquo;The war games, the border
skirmishes? You&rsquo;re blaming all of that on Anne and
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sando&rsquo;s body sagged wearily. &ldquo;To be
honest, I don&rsquo;t know all the details. And if it&rsquo;s
any consolation, I&rsquo;m sure we would have found another reason
if you hadn&rsquo;t come along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joan said, &ldquo;Maybe I should leave.&rdquo; She was
tired of these people, tired of her body, tired of being cut off from
civilization. She had rescued one beau&shy;tiful Niah theorem and
sent it out into the Amalgam. Wasn&rsquo;t that enough?</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to you,&rdquo; Sando replied.
&ldquo;But you might as well stay until they flood the valley.
Another year isn&rsquo;t going to change anything. What
you&rsquo;ve done to this world has already been done. For us,
there&rsquo;s no going back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>7</p>

<p>Joan stayed with the archaeologists as they moved across the
hillside. They found tablets bearing Niah drawings and poetry, which no
doubt had their virtues but to Joan seemed bland and opaque. Sando and
his students rel&shy;ished these discoveries as much as the
theorems; to them, the Niah culture was a vast jigsaw puzzle, and any
clue that filled in the details of their history was as good as any
other.</p>

<p>Sando would have told Pirit everything he&rsquo;d heard
from Joan the night the intruder came, so she was surprised that she
hadn&rsquo;t been summoned for a fresh interrogation to flesh out
the details. Perhaps the Ghahari physi&shy;cists were still
digesting her elaborate gobbledygook, trying to decide if it made
sense. In her more cynical moments she wondered if the intruder might
have been Ghahari himself, sent by Pirit to exploit her friendship with
Sando. Perhaps Sando had even been in on it, and Rah and Surat as well.
The possibility made her feel as if she were living in a fabricated
world, a scape in which nothing was real and nobody could be trusted.
The only thing she was certain that the Ghaharis could not have faked
was the Niah artifacts. The mathematics verified itself; everything
else was subject to doubt and paranoia.</p>

<p>Summer came, burning away the morning fogs. The
Noudah&rsquo;s idea of heat was very different from
Joan&rsquo;s previous perceptions, but even the body she now wore
found the midday sun oppressive. She willed herself to be patient.
There was still a chance that the Niah had taken a few more steps
toward their grand vision of a unified mathematics, and carved their
final discoveries into the form that would outlive them by a million
years.</p>

<p>When the lone fusion ship appeared high in the afternoon sky,
Joan re&shy;solved to ignore it. She glanced up once, but she kept
dragging the tomog&shy;raphy unit across the ground. She was sick
of thinking about Tiran-Ghahari politics. They had played their
childish games for centuries; she would not take the blame for this
latest outbreak of provocation.</p>

<p>Usually the ships flew by, disappearing within minutes,
showing off their power and speed. This one lingered, weaving back and
forth across the sky like some dazzling insect performing an elaborate
mating dance. Joan&rsquo;s second shadow darted around her feet,
hammering a strangely famil&shy;iar rhythm into her brain.</p>

<p>She looked up, disbelieving. The motion of the ship was
following the syntax of a gestural language she had learned on another
planet, in another body, a dozen lifetimes ago. The only other person
on this world who could know that language was Anne</p>

<p>She glanced toward the archaeologists a hundred meters away,
but they seemed to be paying no attention to the ship. She switched off
the tomog&shy;raphy unit and stared into the sky. <em>I&rsquo;m
listening, my friend. What&rsquo;s happening? Did they give you
back your ship? Have you had enough of this world, and decided to go
home?</em></p>

<p>Anne told the story in shorthand, compressed and elliptic. The
Tirans had found a tablet bearing a theorem: the last of the
Niah&rsquo;s discoveries, the pin&shy;nacle of their
achievements. Her minders had not let her study it, but they had
contrived a situation making it easy for her to steal it, and to steal
this ship. They had wanted her to take it and run, in the hope that she
would lead them to something they valued far more than any ancient
mathematics: an advanced spacecraft, or some magical stargate at the
edge of the system.</p>

<p>But Anne wasn&rsquo;t fleeing anywhere. She was high above
Ghahar, reading the tablet, and now she would paint what she read
across the sky for Joan to see.</p>

<p>Sando approached. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in danger, we
have to move.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Danger? That&rsquo;s my friend up there!
She&rsquo;s not going to shoot a missile at us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your friend?&rdquo; Sando seemed confused. As
he spoke, three more ships came into view, lower and brighter than the
first. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been told that the Tirans are going to
strike the valley, to bury the Niah sites. We need to get over the hill
and indoors, to get some protection from the blast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why would the Tirans attack the Niah sites? That
makes no sense to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sando said, &ldquo;Nor me, but I don&rsquo;t have time
to argue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three ships were menacing Anne&rsquo;s, pursuing her,
trying to drive her away. Joan had no idea if they were Ghahari
defending their territory, or Tirans harassing her in the hope that she
would flee and reveal the non&shy;existent shortcut to the stars,
but Anne was staying put, still weaving the same gestural language into
her maneuvers even as she dodged her pursuers, spelling out the
Niah&rsquo;s glorious finale.</p>

<p>Joan said, &ldquo;You go. I have to see this.&rdquo;
She tensed, ready to fight him if necessary.</p>

<p>Sando took something from his tool belt and peppered her side
with holes. Joan gasped with pain and crumpled to the ground as the
sheath fluid poured out of her.</p>

<p>Rali and Surat helped carry her to the shelter. Joan caught
glimpses of the fiery ballet in the sky, but not enough to make sense
of it, let alone re&shy;construct it.</p>

<p>They put her on her couch inside the shelter. Sando bandaged
her side and gave her water to sip. He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry I had to do that, but if any&shy;thing had happened to you I
would have been held responsible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surat kept ducking outside to check on the
&ldquo;battle,&rdquo; then reporting ex&shy;citedly on the
state of play. &ldquo;The Tirans still up there, they
can&rsquo;t get rid of it. I don&rsquo;t know why they
haven&rsquo;t shot it down yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Because the Tirans were the ones pursuing Anne, and
they didn&rsquo;t want her dead. But for how long would the Ghahari
tolerate this violation?</em></p>

<p>Anne&rsquo;s efforts could not be allowed to come to
nothing. Joan struggled to recall the constellations she&rsquo;d
last seen in the night sky. At the node they&rsquo;d departed from,
powerful telescopes were constantly trained on the Noudah&rsquo;s
homeworld. Anne&rsquo;s ship was easily bright enough, its gestures
wide enough, to be resolved from seven light-years away&mdash;if
the planet itself wasn&rsquo;t block&shy;ing the view, if the
node was above the horizon.</p>

<p>The shelter was windowless, but Joan saw the ground outside
the doorway brighten for an instant. The flash was silent; no missile
had struck the valley, the explosion had taken place high above the
atmosphere.</p>

<p>Surat went outside. When she returned she said quietly,
&ldquo;All clear. They got it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joan put all her effort into spitting out a handful of words.
&ldquo;I want to see what happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sando hesitated, then motioned to the others to help him pick
up the couch and carry it outside.</p>

<p>A shell of glowing plasma was still visible, drifting across
the sky as it expanded, a ring of light growing steadily fainter until
it vanished into the afternoon glare.</p>

<p>Anne was dead in this embodiment, but her backup would wake
and go on to new adventures. Joan could at least tell her the story of
her local death: of virtuoso flying and a spectacular end.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;d recovered her bearings now, and she recalled
the position of the stars. The node was still hours away from rising.
The Amalgam was full of powerful telescopes, but no others would be
aimed at this obscure planet, and no plea to redirect them could
outrace the light they would need to capture in order to bring the
Niah&rsquo;s final theorem back to life.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>8</p>

<p>Sando wanted to send her away for medical supervision, but
Joan insisted on remaining at the site.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fewer officials who get to know about this
incident, the fewer problems it makes for you,&rdquo; she reasoned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long as you don&rsquo;t get sick and
die,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to die.&rdquo; Her
wounds had not become infected, and her strength was returning rapidly.</p>

<p>They compromised. Sando hired someone to drive up from the
nearest town to look after her while he was out at the excavation. Daya
had basic medical training and didn&rsquo;t ask awkward questions;
he seemed happy to tend to Joan&rsquo;s needs, and then lie outside
daydreaming the rest of the time.</p>

<p>There was still a chance, Joan thought, that the Niah had
carved the theorem on a multitude of tablets and scattered them all
over the planet. There was also a chance that the Tirans had made
copies of the tablet before letting Anne abscond with it. The question,
though, was whether she had the slightest prospect of getting her hands
on these duplicates.</p>

<p>Anne might have made some kind of copy herself, but she
hadn&rsquo;t men&shy;tioned it in the prologue to her aerobatic
rendition of the theorem. If she&rsquo;d had any time to spare, she
wouldn&rsquo;t have limited herself to an audience of one: she
would have waited until the node had risen over Ghahar.</p>

<p>On her second night as an invalid, Joan dreamed that she saw
Anne standing on the hill looking back into the fog-shrouded valley,
her shadow haloed by the Niah light.</p>

<p>When she woke, she knew what she had to do.</p>

<p>When Sando left, she asked Daya to bring her the console that
controlled the satellite dish. She had enough strength in her arms now
to operate it, and Daya showed no interest in what she did. That was
naive, of course: whether or not Daya was spying on her, Pirit would
know exactly where the signal was sent. So be it. Seven light-years was
still far beyond the Nou&shy;dah&rsquo;s reach; the whole node
could be disassembled and erased long before they came close.</p>

<p>No message could outrace light directly, but there were more
ways for light to reach the node than the direct path, the fastest one.
Every black hole had its glory, twisting light around it in a tight,
close orbit and flinging it back out again. Seventy-four hours after
the original image was lost to them, the telescopes at the node could
still turn to the Cataract and scour the distorted, compressed image of
the sky at the rim of the hole&rsquo;s black disk to catch a replay
of Anne&rsquo;s ballet.</p>

<p>Joan composed the message and entered the coordinates of the
node. <em>You didn&rsquo;t die for nothing, my friend. When
you wake and see this, you&rsquo;ll be proud of us both.</em></p>

<p>She hesitated, her hand hovering above the send key. The
Tirans had wanted Anne to flee, to show them the way to the stars, but
had they really been indifferent to the loot they&rsquo;d let her
carry? The theorem had come at the end of the Niah&rsquo;s
three-million-year reign. To witness this beautiful truth would not
destroy the Amalgam, but might it not weaken it? If the
Seekers&rsquo; thirst for knowledge was slaked, their sense of
purpose corroded, might not the most crucial strand of the culture fall
into a twilight of its own? There was no shortcut to the stars, but the
Noudah had been goaded by their alien visitors, and the technology
would come to them soon enough.</p>

<p>The Amalgam had been goaded too: the theorem she&rsquo;d
already transmit&shy;ted would send a wave of excitement around the
galaxy, strengthening the Seekers, encouraging them to complete the
unification by their own efforts. The Big Crunch might be inevitable,
but at least she could delay it, and hope that the robustness and
diversity of the Amalgam would carry them through it, and beyond.</p>

<p>She erased the message and wrote a new one, addressed to her
backup via the decoy node. It would have been nice to upload all her
memories, but the Noudah were ruthless, and she wasn&rsquo;t
prepared to stay any longer and risk being used by them. This sketch,
this postcard, would have to be enough.</p>

<p>When the transmission was complete she left a note for Sando
in the console&rsquo;s memory.</p>

<p>Daya called out to her, &ldquo;Jown? Do you need
anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She said, &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m going to sleep for a
while.&rdquo;</p>
