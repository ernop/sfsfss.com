today, the “invention” of television is usually ascribed to Paul Nipkow of
Germany, and the year is given as 1884. Nipkow used the principle of the
variation in the electrical conductivity of selenium when exposed to light, and
he used scanning discs as mechanical effectors.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>What else was there for him to
use before the development of the phototube and the current-amplifying electron
tube? The resolution of Nipkow’s television was very poor due to the “slow
light” characteristics of selenium response and the lack of amplification.
There were, however, several men in the United States who transmitted a sort of
television before Nipkow did so in Germany.</span></p>

even earlier experimenters in the field (Aurelian Bentley, Jessy Polk, Samuel
J. Perry, Gifford Hudgeons) was even poorer than was the case with Nipkow.
Indeed, none of these pre-Nipkow inventors in the television field is worthy of
much attention, except Bentley. And the interest in Bentley is in the content
of his transmissions and not in his technical ineptitude.</span></p>

into the argument of who really did first “invent” television (it was not Paul
Nipkow, and it probably was not Aurelian Bentley or Jessy Polk either); our
object is to examine some of the earliest true television dramas in their own
queer “slow light” context. And the first of those “slow light” or selenium (“moonshine”)
dramas were put together by Aurelian Bentley in the year 1873.</span></p>

is always the freshest and is often the best. Homer composed the first and
freshest, and probably the best, epic poetry. Whatever cave man did the first
painting, it remains among the freshest as well as the best paintings ever
done. Aeschylus composed the first and best tragic dramas, Euclid invented the
first and best of the artful mathematics (we speak here of mathematics as an<i>
art</i> without being concerned with its accuracy or practicality). And it may
be that Aurelian Bentley produced the best of all television dramas in spite of
their primitive aspect.</span></p>

was not very successful despite his fee of one thousand dollars per day for
each subscriber. In his heyday (or his hey-month, November of 1873), Bentley
had fifty-nine subscribers in New York City, seventeen in Boston, fourteen in
Philadelphia, and one in Hoboken. This gave him an income of ninety-one
thousand dollars a day (which would be the equivalent of about a million
dollars a day in today’s terms), but Bentley was extravagant and prodigal, and
he always insisted that he had expenses that the world wotted not of. In any
case, Bentley was broke and out of business by the beginning of the year 1874.
He was also dead by that time.</span></p>

The Wonderful World of Aurelian Bentley</i> are thirteen of the “slow light”
dramas, the master projector, and nineteen of the old television receivers.
There are probably others of the receivers around somewhere, and persons coming
onto them might not know what they are for. They do not look much like the
television sets of later years.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>The one we use for playing the
old dramas is a good kerosene-powered model which we found and bought for
eighteen dollars two years ago. If the old sets are ever properly identified
and become collectors’ items, the price on them may double or even triple. We
told the owner of the antique that it was a chestnut roaster, and with a proper
rack installed it could likely be made to serve as that.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>We bought the master projector
for twenty-six dollars. We told the owner of that monster that it was a chicken
incubator. The thirteen dramas in their canisters we had for thirty-nine
dollars total. We had to add formaldehyde to activate the dramas, however, and
we had to add it to both the projector and the receiver; the formaldehyde
itself came to fifty-two dollars. I discovered soon that the canisters with
their dramas were not really needed, nor was the master projector. The receiver
itself would repeat everything that it had ever received. Still and all, it was
money well spent.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span

small dynamo that imposed an electrical grid on the selenium matrix and
awakened the memories of the dramas.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>There was, however, an oddity in
all the playbacks. The film-fix of the receiver continued to receive
impressions so that every time a “slow light” drama is presented it is
different, because of the feedback. The resolution of the pictures<i> improves</i>
with use and is now much clearer and more enjoyable than originally.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>The librettos of the first twelve
of the thirteen Bentley dramas are not good, not nearly as good as the
librettos of the Jessy Polk and the Samuel J. Perry dramas later in the decade.
Aurelian Bentley was not a literary man; he was not even a completely literate
man. His genius had many gaping holes in it. But he was a passionately dramatic
man, and these dramas which he himself devised and directed have a great sweep
and action to them. And even the librettos from which he worked are valuable
for one reason. They tell us, though sometimes rather ineptly and vaguely, what
the dramas themselves are all about. Without these outlines, we would have no
idea in the world of the meaning of the powerful dramas.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>There was an unreality, a “ghostliness,”
about all the dramas, as though they were made by sewer light underground: or
as if they were made by poor quality moonlight. Remember that the element<i>
selenium</i> (the metal that is not a metal), the chemical basis of the dramas,
is named from<i> Selene,</i> the moon.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>Bentley did not use “moving
pictures” of quickly succeeding frames to capture and transmit his live
presentation dramas. Although Muybridge was in fact working on the
zoopraxiscope (the first “moving picture” device) at that very time, his still
incomplete work was not known to Aurelian Bentley. Samuel J. Perry and Gilford
Hudgeons did use “moving picture” techniques for their primitive television
dramas later in the decade; but Bentley, fortunately perhaps, did not. Each of
Bentley’s thirty-minute live dramas, however it appeared for the first time in
the first television receiver, was recorded in one single matrix or frame: and,
thereafter, that picture took on a life and growth of its own. It was to some
extent independent of sequence (an effect that has been attempted and failed of
in several of the other arts); and it had a free way with time and space
generally. This is part of the “ghostliness” of the dramas, and it is a large
part of their power and charm. Each drama was one evolving moment outside of
time and space (though mostly the scenes were in New York City and in the
Barrens of New Jersey).</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>Of course there was no sound in
these early Bentley dramas, but let us not go too far astray with that
particular “of course.” “Slow sound” as well as “slow light” is a
characteristic of selenium response, and we will soon see that sound did in
fact creep into some of the dramas after much replaying. Whether their total
effects were accidental or by design, these early television dramas were
absolutely unique.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>1.<i>
The Perils of Patience, a Damnable Chase.</i> In this, Clarinda Calliope, who
was possibly one of the greatest actresses of American or world drama, played
the part of Patience Palmer in the title role. Leslie Whitemansion played the
role of Simon Legree. Kirbac Fouet played the part of “the Whip,” a sinister
character. X. Paul McCoffin played the role of “the Embalmer.” Jaime del Diablo
played “the Jesuit,” one of the most menacing roles in all drama. Torres Malgre
played “the Slaver,” who carried the forged certificate showing that Patience
had a shadow of black blood and so might be returned to slavery on San Croix.
Inspiro Spectralski played “the Panther” (Is he a Man? Is he a Ghost?), who is
the embodiment of an evil that is perhaps from beyond the world. Hubert Saint
Nicholas played the part of “the Guardian,” who is really a false guardian.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>This<i> Damnable Chase</i> is
really a galloping allegory. It is the allegory of good against evil, of light
against darkness, of inventiveness against crude obtuseness, of life against
death, of openness against intrigue, of love against hatred, of courage against
hellish fear. For excitement and intensity, this drama has hardly an equal.
Time and again, it seemed that the Embalmer, striking out of the dark, would
stab Patience with his needle full of the dread embalming fluid and so trap her
in the rigidity of living death. Time and again, it seemed that the Whip would
cut the flesh of Patience Palmer with his long lash with viper poison on its
iron tip that would bring instant death. At every eventuality, it seemed as
though Simon Legree or the Slaver would enslave her body, or the Jesuit or the
Panther would enslave her soul. And her mysterious Guardian seems always about
to save her, but his every attempt to save her has such reverse and disastrous
effects as to cast doubt on the honesty and sincerity of the Guardian.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>A high point of the drama is the
duel of the locomotives that takes place during a tempestuous night in the West
Orange Switching Yards. Again and again, Patience Palmer is all but trapped on
railroad trestles by thundering locomotives driven by her adversaries (the West
Orange Switching Yards seem to consist almost entirely of very high railroad
trestles). Patience finally gets control of a locomotive of her own on which to
escape, but the locomotives of her enemies thunder at her from every direction so
that she is able to switch out of their way only at the last brink of every
moment.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>The Embalmer attempts to stab her
with his needleful of embalming fluid every time their locomotives pass each
other with double thunder and only inches to spare. The Whip tries to lash her
with his cruel lash with its poisoned tip; and the Slaver threatens her with
the outreached forged certificate of color, and only by fantastic cringing can
she cringe back far enough to keep from being touched by it as their locomotives
roar past each other in opposite directions.</span></p>

racing locomotives can come so close and not hit each other, with their
dazzling switching from track to track. And then (Oh, God save us all!) the
Panther (Is he a Man? Is he a Devil?) has leapt from his own locomotive to that
of Patience Palmer: he is behind her on her own locomotive, and<i> she does not
see him.</i> He comes closer—</span></p>

style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>But the climax of<i> The Perils
of Patience</i> is not there in the West Orange Switching Yards. It is at a secret
town and castle in the Barrens of New Jersey, a castle of evil repute. In this
place the enemies of Patience were assembling a gang of beaters (slack-faced
fellows with their tongues cut out), and they were readying bloodhounds to hunt
Patience down to her death. She somehow obtains a large wagon piled high with
hay and pulled by six large and high-spirited horses. With this, she boldly
drives, on a stormy night, into the secret town of her enemies and down that
jagged road (there was a lightning storm going on that made everything seem
jagged) at the end of which was the castle itself. The bloodhounds leap high at
her as she passes, but they cannot pull her from the wagon.</span></p>

making her move. Driving unswervingly, carrying out her own intrepid plan, at
that very moment she raises a key in her hand very high into the air. This
draws the lightning down with a stunning flash, and the hay wagon is set
ablaze. Patience leaps clear of the flaming hay wagon at the last possible

to set it and its outbuildings and its whole town ablaze.</span></p>

Daggers, a Murder Mystery.</i> This is the second of the Aurelian Bentley
television dramas of 1873. Clarinda Calliope, one of the most talented
actresses of her time, played the part of Maud Trenchant, the Girl Detective.
The actors Leslie Whitemansion, Kirbac Fouet, X. Paul McCoffin, Jaime del
Diablo, Torres Malgre, Inspire Spectralski, and Hubert Saint Nicholas played
powerful and menacing roles, but their identities and purposes cannot be set
exactly. One must enter into the bloody and thrilling spirit of the drama
without knowing the details.</span></p>

accompanied by a deficiency of the libretto, leads to confusion.</span></p>

It is the sounds of all outdoors that are heard in this drama, faintly at

they are county-fair sounds. Though the sounds seem to be an accidental

quality lends belief to the evidence that the full and original title of this

the five days, and the kitty grew and grew. From the great fairground
grandstand, one could see almost all of the twenty-mile course that the riders
rode, or could follow it by the plumes of dust. The grandstand was on high
ground and the whole countryside was spread out before it. Cattle and mules
were paraded and judged in front of that grandstand, before and during and
after that daily race; then the race (for the approximate hour that it took to
run it) was the big thing. There were seven drivers in the race, and all of

this, the multitalented Clarinda Calliope played the role of Florence
Nightingale, of Ekmek Kaya, a Turkish lady of doubtful virtue who was the
number-four wife and current favorite of the Turkish admiral, of Chiara
Maldonado, a young lady camp follower with the army of Savoy, of Katya Petrova,
who was a Russian princess as well as a triple spy, and of Claudette Boudin, a
French lady journalist. Clarinda also masqueraded as Claudette’s twin brother Claude,
a colonel with the French forces, and as such she led the French to a
surprising victory over the Russians at Eupatoria. The unmasqueraded Claude
himself was played by Apollo Mont-de-Marsan, a young actor making his first

is unmistakable evidence that some of the subvocalizations (thoughts) of the

selenium-triggered “slow thought.” Some of these manifestations were the role
thoughts of the actors so strangely vocalized (Clarinda Calliope, for instance,
could not speak or think in any tongues except English and her own Pennsylvania
Dutch in normal circumstances: but in her triple spy roles we find her thinking
out loud in Turkish and Greek and Russian); and other of the vocalizations are

Clarence Greenback, Confidence Man</i> was the ninth of the Aurelian Bentley

the casino owner. It was the first time that Clarinda Calliope had not played

was this another instance of the left lobe of Aurelian Bentley having lost its

show Bentley’s dramatic powers in almost complete decline and himself mightily

did not return yet, but his sense of dramatic horror as motive force was

The Ghost at the Opera</i> is the eleventh of the Aurelian Bentley television
dramas in the year 1873.<i> The Ghost</i> is based on Verdi’s<i> Il Trovatore,</i>
but Bentley’s production is quite original for all that. The role of Leonora is
played by Miss Adeline Addams. But the same role is also played by Clarinda
Calliope, who was originally selected to play the role by herself. This
business of having two different persons playing the same role creates a
certain duality, one might almost say a certain duplicity, in the drama.</span></p>

is the inept and stumbling Clarinda trying again and again to sing parts of the
Leonora role and failing in it totally and being jerked off stage by the stage
manager’s crook; and it is the beautiful and brimming genius Adeline Addams
coming on and performing the same role brilliantly. This provides the “cruel
comedy” that is usually lacking in Verdi; for, without cruelty, only a limited
success is ever possible in opera. But Clarinda took some very bad falls from
the stageman’s crook jerking her off her feet, and besides she was still weak
and falling down from all the blood she had lost in her roles in<i> The
Vampires of Varuma.</i> She was suffering.</span></p>
