stare at his shoes. They were lousy, cracked shoes, lousy and dirty like the
rest of him. Every once in a while, his left shoulder hitched up in a kind of

with it. I wind up with five, you wind up with twenty.”</span></p>

face, taking a little dirt off, then he rubbed the hand against the lapel of
his jacket and left the dirt there. “No deal?” he asked. “A twenty for a five?

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>He reached over, dropped the card
on my desk, on top of all the surplus notices, coughed once or twice, looked at

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>For that matter, the whole play
was out of the ordinary. I began to be a little sorry I hadn’t let him run
through the whole thing. After all, what was he trying to do but give me an
offbeat sales pitch? I can always use an offbeat sales pitch. I work out of a
small office, I buy and sell, but half my stock is good ideas. I’ll use ideas,
even from a bum.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>The card was clean and white,
except where the smudge from his fingers made a brown blot. Written across it in
a kind of ornate handwriting were the words<i> Mr. Ogo Eksar.</i> Under that
was the name and the telephone number of a hotel in the Times Square area, not
far from my office.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>There was a room number in one
corner of the card. I stared at it and I felt kind of funny. I really didn’t

style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>Although, come to think of it,
why couldn’t a panhandler be registered at a hotel? “Don’t be a snob, Bernie,”

style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>He’d thrown a lot my way—a tip on
the college building program that was worth a painless fifteen hundred, an
office-equipment disposal from the United Nations, stuff like that. And any
time I had any questions that needed a college education, he was on tap. All
for the couple, three hundred, he got out of me in commissions.</span></p>

out of work and on the verge of starvation, they were so intent on not being

wiped his lips with a napkin. “I think you’re on the right track, Morris,” he
said, and I swung my attention back to him. “We can postulate a civilization
far in advance of our own. One that would feel we’re not quite ready to know

in a while, a ship would smash upon the coral reefs, and a bloody opportunist
out of Boston would be stranded for life among primitive, backward tribesmen. I’m

little planet which it’s against the law to be near in the first place. He can
make some half-assed repairs with merchandise that’s available here—but he has
to buy the stuff. Any noise, any uproar, and he’ll be grabbed for a Federal rap

of the month with that canceled check I’d given Eksar. It had been endorsed by
a big store in the Cortlandt Street area. I know that store. I’ve dealt with
them. I went down and asked them about it.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>They handle mostly marked-down,
surplus electronic equipment. That’s what they said Eksar had bought. A
walloping big order of transistors and transformers, resistors and printed
circuits, electronic tubes, wiring, tools, gimmicks like that. All mixed up,
they said, a lot of components that just didn’t go together. He’d given the
clerk the impression that he had an emergency job to do—and he’d take as close
as he could get to the things he actually needed. He’d paid a lot of money for
freight charges: delivery was to some backwoods town in northern Canada.</span></p>

admit it. But here’s another one.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>I’ve dealt with that store, like
I said. Their prices are the lowest in the neighborhood. And why is it, do you
think, they can sell so cheap? There’s only one answer: because they buy so
cheap. They buy at the lowest prices; they don’t give a damn about quality: all
they want to know is, how much markup? I’ve personally sold them job lots of
electronic junk that I couldn’t unload anywhere else, condemned stuff, badly
wired stuff, stuff that was almost dangerous—it’s a place to sell to when you’ve
given up on making a profit because you yourself have been stuck with inferior
merchandise in the first place.</span></p>

way I see it. He’s fixed up his ship, good enough to travel, and he’s on his
way to his next big deal. The motors are humming, the ship is running, and he’s
sitting there with a big smile on his dirty face: he’s thinking how he took me,
how easy it was.</span></p>
