<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Mark Clifton<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>IT HAD to be <span
class=GramE>I</span>. It would be stupid to say that the burden should have
fallen to a great statesman, a world leader, a renowned scientist. With all
modesty, I think I am one of the few who could have caught the problem early
enough to avert disaster. I have a peculiar skill. The whole thing hinged on
that. I have learned to know human beings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The first tithe I saw
the fellow, I was at the drug-store counter buying cigarettes. He was standing
at the magazine rack. One might have thought from the expression on his face
that he had never seen magazines before. Still, quite a number of people get
that rapt and vacant look when they can't make up their minds to a choice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The thing which
bothered me in that casual glance was that I couldn't recognize him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>There are others who
can match my record in taking case histories. I happened to be the one who came
in contact with this fellow. For thirty years I have been listening to, talking
with, counseling people—over two hundred thousand of them. They have not been
routine interviews. I have brought intelli­gence, sensitivity and concern to
each of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Mine has been a
driving, burning desire to know people. Not from the western scientific point
of view of devising tools and rules to measure animated robots and ignoring the
man be­neath. Nor from the eastern metaphysical approach to painting a picture
of the soul by blowing one's <span class=GramE>breath</span> upon a fog to be
blurred and dispersed by the next breath.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Mine was the aim to
know the man by making use of both. And there was some success.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>A competent geographer
can look at a crude sketch of a map and instantly orient himself to it anywhere
in the world—the bend of a river, the angle of a lake, the twist of a mountain
range. And he can mystify by telling in finest detail what is to be found
there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>After about fifty
thousand studies where I could predict and then observe and check, with me it
became the lift of a brow, the curve of a mouth, the gesture of a hand, the
slope of a shoulder. One of the universities became interested, and over a
long, controlled period they rated me 92 per cent accurate. That was fifteen
years ago. I may have improved some since.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Yet standing there at
the cigarette counter and glancing at the young fellow at the magazine rack, I
could read nothing. <span class=GramE>Nothing at all.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>If this had been an
ordinary face, I would have catalogued it and forgotten it automatically. I see
them by the thousands. But this face would not be catalogued nor forgotten,
because there was nothing in it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>I started to write
that it wasn't even a face, but of course it was. Every human being has a
face—of one sort or another.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In build he was short,
muscular, rather well proportioned. The hair was crew cut and blond, the eyes
were blue, the skin fair. All nice and standard Teutonic—only it wasn't.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>I finished paying for
my cigarettes and gave him one more glance, hoping to surprise an expression
which had some mean­ing. There was none. I left him standing there and walked
out on the street and around the corner. The <span class=GramE>street, the
store fronts, the traffic cop on the corner, the warm sunshine were</span> all
so familiar I didn't see them. I climbed the stairs to my office in the building
over the drug store. My employment-agency wait­ing room was empty. I don't
cater <span class=GramE>to</span> much of a crowd because it cuts down my
opportunity to talk with people and further my study.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Margie, my
receptionist, was busy making out some kind of a report and, merely nodded as I
passed her desk to my own office. She is a good, conscientious girl who can't
understand why I spend so much time working with bums and drunks and other
psychos who obviously won't bring fees into the some­times too small bank
account.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>I sat down at my desk
and said aloud to <span class=GramE>myself</span>, &quot;The guy is a fake! As
obvious as a high-school boy's drafting of a dollar bill.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>I heard myself say
that and wondered if I was going nuts, myself. What did I mean by fake? I
shrugged. So I happened to see a bird I couldn't read, that was all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Then it struck me. But
that would be unique. I hadn't had that experience for twenty years. Imagine
the delight, after all these years, of exploring an unreadable!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>I rushed out of my
office and back down the stairs to the street. <span class=SpellE>Hallahan</span>,
the traffic cop, saw me running up the street and looked at me curiously. I
signaled to him with a wave of a hand that everything was all right. He lifted
his cap and scratched his head. He shook his head slowly and settled his cap
back down. He blew a whistle at a woman driver and went back to directing
traffic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>I ran into the drug
store. Of course the guy wasn't there. I looked all around, hoping he was
hiding behind the pots and pans counter, or something. No guy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>I walked quickly back
out on the street and down to the next corner. I looked up and down the side
streets. No guy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>I dragged my feet
reluctantly back toward the office. I called up the face again to study it. It
did no good. The first mental glimpse of it told me there was nothing to find.
Logic told me there was nothing to find. <span class=GramE>If there had been, I
wouldn't be in such a stew.</span> The face was empty—completely void of human
feelings or character.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>No, those weren't the
right words. Completely void of human—being!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>I walked on past the
drug store again and looked in curi­ously, hoping I would see him. <span
class=SpellE>Hallahan</span> was facing my direc­tion again, and he grinned
crookedly at me. I expect around the neighborhood I am known as a character. I
ask the queerest questions of people, from a layman's point of view. Still,
appli­cants sometimes tell me that when they asked a cop where <span
class=GramE>was an employment agent</span> they could trust they were sent to
me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>I climbed the stairs
again, and walked into my waiting room. Margie looked at me curiously, but she
only said, &quot;There's an applicant. I had him wait in your office.&quot; She
looked like she wanted to say more, and then shrugged. Or maybe she shivered. I
knew there was something wrong with the bird, or she would have kept him in the
waiting room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>I opened the door to
my office, and experienced an over­whelming sense of relief, fulfillment. It
was he. Still, it was logical that he should be there. I run an employment <span
class=GramE>agency,</span> People come to me to get help in finding work. If
others, why not he?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span class=GramE><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>My
skill <span class=SpellE>indudes</span> the control of my outward reactions.</span></span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> That fellow could have no idea of the delight I felt
at the opportunity to get a full history. If I had found him on the street, the
best I might have done was a stock question about what time is it, or have you
got a match, or where is the city hall. Here I could question him to my <span
class=GramE>heart's</span>. <span class=GramE>content</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>I took his history
without comment, and stuck to routine questions. It was all exactly right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>He was an ex-G.I.,
just completed college, major in astron­omy, no experience, no skills, no
faintest idea of what he wanted to do, nothing to offer an employer—all
perfectly normal for a young grad„<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>No feeling or
expression, either. Not so normal. Usually they're petulantly resentful that
business doesn't swoon at the chance of hiring them. I resigned myself to the
old one-two of attempting to steer him toward something practical.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span class=GramE><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Astronomy?&quot;</span></span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> I asked. &quot;That means you're heavy in math.
Frequently we can place a strong math skill in statistical work.&quot; I was
hopeful I could get a spark of something.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>It turned out he
wasn't very good at math. &quot;I haven't yet reconciled my math to . . .&quot;
he stopped. For the first time he showed a reaction—hesitancy. Prior to that he
had been a statue from Greece—the rounded, expressionless eyes, the too-perfect
features undisturbed by thou2ht.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>He caught his remark
and finished, &quot;I'm just not very good at math, that's all.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>I sighed to myself.
I'm used to that, too. They give degrees nowadays to get rid of the guys, I
suppose. Sometimes I'll go for days without uncovering any usable knowledge. So
in a way, that was normal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The only abnormal part
of it was he seemed to think it didn't sound right. Usually the lads don't even
realize they should know something. He seemed to think he'd pulled a boner by
admitting that a man can take a degree in astronomy without learning math. Well,
I wouldn't be surprised to see them take their degrees without knowing how many
planets there are.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>He began to fidget a
bit. That was strange, also. I thought I knew every possible combination of
muscular contractions and expansions. This fidget had all the reality of a
puppet activated by an amateur. <span class=GramE>And the eyes—still completely
blank.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>I led him up one
mental street and down the next. And of all the false-fronted stores and
cardboard houses and paper lawns, I never saw the like. I get something of that
once in a while from a fellow who has spent a long term in prison and comes in
with a manufactured past—but never anything as phony as this one was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span class=GramE><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Interesting
aspect to it.</span></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'> Most guys, when they
realize you've spotted them for a phony, get out as soon as they can. He
didn't. I was almost as though he were—well testing, to see if his answers
would stand up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>I tried talking
astronomy, of which I thought I knew a little. I found I didn't know anything,
or he didn't. This bird's astronomy and mine had no point of reconciliation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>And then he had a slip
of the tongue—yes he did. He was talking, and said, &quot;The ten planets ...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>He caught himself,
&quot;Oh that's right. There are only nine.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Could be ignorance,
but I didn't think so. Could be he knew of the existence of a planet we hadn't
yet discovered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>I smiled. I opened a
desk drawer and pulled out a couple science-fiction magazines. &quot;Ever read
any of these?&quot; I asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;I looked through
several of them at the newsstand a while ago,&quot; he answered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;They've enlarged
my vision,&quot; I said. &quot;Even to the point where I could believe that
some other star system might hold intelligence.&quot; I lit a cigarette and
waited. If I was wrong, he would merely think I was talking at random.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>His blank eyes
changed. They were no longer Greek-statue eyes. They were no longer blue. They
were black, deep bottom­less black, as deep and cold as space itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Where did I fail
in my test?&quot; he asked. His lips formed a smile which was not a smile—a
carefully painted-on-canvas sort of smile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-69.0pt;text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:
none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Well, I'd had my
answer. I'd explored something unique, all right. Sitting there before me, I
had no way of determining whether he was benign or evil. No way of knowing his

Knowing about a <span class=GramE>man,</span> and knowing a man are two

honor, justice, perfection—all unknown. They had not even a division of sexes,
and the emotion we call love was beyond their understanding. The TV stories
they saw must have been like watching a parade of ants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
