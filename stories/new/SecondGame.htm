<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sign was big, with black letters that read: I'LL BEAT YOU THE SECOND
GAME.</p>

<p>I eased myself into a seat behind the play board, straightened the
pitchman's cloak about my shoulders, took a final deep breath, let it out—and
waited.</p>

<p>A nearby Fair visitor glanced at the sign as he hurried by. His eyes widened
with anticipated pleasure and he shifted his gaze to me, weighing me with the
glance.</p>

<p>I knew I had him.</p>

<p>The man changed direction and came over to where I sat. &quot;Are you giving
any odds?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Ten to one,&quot; I answered.</p>

<p>&quot;A dronker.&quot; He wrote on a blue slip with a white stylus, dropped
it at my elbow, and sat down.</p>

<p>&quot;We play the first game for feel,&quot; I said. &quot;Second game
pays.&quot;</p>

<p>Gradually I let my body relax. Its weight pulled at the muscles of my back
and shoulders, and I slouched into a half-slump. I could feel my eyelids droop
as I released them, and the corners of my mouth pulled down. I probably
appeared tired and melancholy. Or like a man operating in a gravity heavier
than was normal for him. Which I was.</p>

<p>I had come to this world called Velda two weeks earlier. My job was to find
why its humanlike inhabitants refused all contacts with the Federation.</p>

<p>Earth's colonies had expanded during the last several centuries until they
now comprised a loose alliance known as The Ten Thousand Worlds. They were
normally peaceful—and wanted peace with Velda. But you cannot talk peace with a
people who won't talk back. Worse, they had obliterated the fleet bringing our
initial peace overtures. As a final gesture I had been smuggled in—in an
attempt to breach that stand-off stubbornness. This booth at their Fair was my
best chance—as I saw it—to secure audience with the men in authority. And with
luck it would serve a double purpose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>Several Veldians gathered around the booth and watched with interest as my
opponent and I chose colors. He took the red; I the black. We arranged our
fifty-two pieces on their squares and I nodded to him to make the first move.</p>

<p>He was an anemic oldster with an air of nervous energy, and he played the
same way, with intense concentration. By the fourth move I knew he would not
win. On each play he had to consult the value board suspended between us before
deciding what his next move would be. On a play board with one hundred and
sixty-nine squares, each with a different value—in fact one set of values for
offense, and another for defense—only a brilliant player could keep them all in
mind. But no man without that ability was going to beat me.</p>

<p>I let him win the first game. Deliberately. The &quot;second game counts&quot;
gimmick was not only to attract attention, but to give me a chance to test a
player's strength—and find his weakness.</p>

<p>At the start of<b> </b>the second game, the oldster moved his front row
center pukt three squares forward and one left oblique. I checked it with an
end pukt, and waited.</p>

<p>The contest was not going to be exacting enough to hold my complete
attention. Already an eidetic portion of my mind—which I always thought of as a
small machine, ticking away in one corner of my skull, independent of any control
or direction from me—was moving its interest out to the spectators around my
booth.</p>

<p>It caught a half-completed gesture of admiration at my last move from a
youth directly ahead of me. And with the motion, and the glimpse of the youth's
face, something slipped into place in my memory. Some subconscious counting
finished itself, and I knew that there had been too many of those youths, with
faces like this one, finely boned and smooth, with slender delicate necks and
slim hands and movements that were cool and detached. Far too many to be a
normal number in a population of adults and children.</p>

<p>As if drawn, my glance went past the forms of the watchers around the booth
and plumbed the passing crowd to the figure of a man; a magnificent masculine
type of the Veldian race, thick shouldered and strong, thoughtful in motion,
yet with something of the swagger of a gladiator, who, as he walked, spoke to
the woman who held his arm, leaning toward her cherishingly as if he protected
a great prize.</p>

<p>She was wearing a concealing cloak, but her face was beautiful, her hair
semi-long, and in spite of the cloak I could see that her body was full-fleshed
and almost voluptuously feminine. I had seen few such women on Velda.</p>

<p>Two of the slim, delicately built youths went by arm in arm, walking with a
slight defiant sway of bodies, and looked at the couple as they passed, with a
pleasure in the way the man's fascinated attention clove to the woman, and
looked at the beauty of the woman possessively without lust, and passed by, their
heads held higher in pride as if they shared a secret triumph with her. Yet
they were strangers.</p>

<p>I had an answer to my counting. The &quot;youths&quot; with the large eyes
and smooth delicate heads, with the slim straight asexual bodies, thought of
themselves as women. I had not seen them treated with the subdued attraction
and conscious avoidance one sex gives another, but by
numbers&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;My memory added the number of these
&quot;youths&quot; to the numbers of figures and faces that had been obviously
female. It totaled to almost half the population I had seen. No matter what the
biological explanation, it seemed reasonable that half . . .</p>

<p>I bent my head, to not see the enigma of the boy-woman face watching me, and
braced my elbow to steady my hand as I moved. For two weeks I had been on Velda
and during the second week I had come out of hiding and passed as a Veldian. It
was incredible that I had been operating under a misunderstanding as to which
were women, and which men, and not blundered openly. The luck that had saved me
had been undeserved.</p>

<p>Opposite me, across the board, the bleach-skinned hand of the<b> </b>oldster
was beginning to waver with indecision as each pukt was placed. He was seeing
defeat, and not wishing to see it.</p>

<p>In eight more minutes I completed the rout of his forces and closed out the
game. In<b> </b>winning I had lost only two pukts. The other's defeat was
crushing, but my ruthlessness had been deliberate. I wanted my reputation to
spread.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>My sign, and the game in progress, by now had attracted a line of challengers,
but as the oldster left the line broke and most of them shook their heads and
moved back, then crowded around the booth and good-naturedly elbowed their way
to positions of better vantage.</p>

<p>I knew then that I had set my lure with an irresistible bait. On a world
where the Game was played from earliest childhood—was in fact a vital aspect of
their culture—my challenge could not be ignored. I pocketed the loser's blue
slip and nodded to the first in line of the four men who still waited to try
me.</p>

<p>This second man played a better game than the old one. He had a fine
tight-knit offensive, with a good grasp of values, but his weakness showed
early in the game when I saw him hesitate before making a simple move in a
defensive play. He was not skilled in the strategy of retreat and defense, or
not suited to it by temperament. He would be unable to cope with a swift
forward press, I decided.</p>

<p>I was right.</p>

<p>Some of the challengers bet more, some less, all lost on the second game. I
purchased a nut and fruit confection from a passing food vender and ate it for
a sparse lunch while I played through the late afternoon hours.</p>

<p>By the time Velda's distant sun had begun to print long shadows across the
Fair grounds, I was certain that word of my booth had spread well.</p>

<p>The crowd about the railing of my stand was larger—but the players were
fewer. Sometimes I had a break of several minutes before one made a decision to
try his skill. And there were no more challenges from ordinary players. Still
the results were the same. None had sufficient adroitness to give me more than
a passing contest.</p>

<p>Until Caertin Vlosmin made his appearance.</p>

<p>Vlosmin played a game intended to be impregnably defensive, to remain
untouchable until an opponent made a misplay or an overzealous drive, of which
he would then take advantage. But his mental prowess was not quite great enough
to be certain of a sufficiently concealed or complex weakness in the approach of
an adversary, and he would not hazard an attack on an uncertainty. Excess
caution was his weakness.</p>

<p>During our play I sensed that the crowd about us was very intent and still.
On the outskirts, newcomers inquiring cheerfully were silenced by whispered exclamations.</p>

<p>Though it required all my concentration the game was soon over. I looked at
Vlosmin as he rose to his feet, and noted with surprise that a fine spotting of
moisture brightened his upper lip. Only then did I recognize the strain and
effort he had invested into the attempt to defeat me.</p>

<p>&quot;You are an exceptional craftsman,&quot; he said. There was a grave
emphasis he put on the &quot;exceptional&quot; which I could not miss, and I
saw that his face was whiter.</p>

<p>His formal introduction of himself earlier as &quot;Caertin Vlosmin&quot;
had meant something more than I had realized at the time.</p>

<p>I had just played against, and defeated, one of the Great Players!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>The sun set a short time later and floating particles of light-reflecting
air-foam drifted out over the Fair grounds. Someway they were held suspended
above the ground while air currents tossed them about and intermingled them in
the radiance of vari-hued spotlights. The area was still as bright as day, but
filled with pale, shifting shadows that seemed to heighten the byplay of sound
and excitement coming from the Fair visitors.</p>

<p>Around my booth all was quiet; the spectators were subdued—as though waiting
for the next act in a tense drama. I was very tired now, but I knew by the
tenseness I observed around me that I did not have much longer to wait.</p>

<p>By the bubbles' light I watched new spectators take their positions about my
booth. And as time went by I saw that some of them did not move on, as my
earlier visitors had done.</p>

<p>The weight that rode my stomach muscles grew abruptly heavier, I had set my
net with all the audacity of a spider waiting for a fly, yet I knew that when
my anticipated victim arrived he would more likely resemble a spider hawk.
Still the weight was not caused by fear: It was excitement—the excitement of
the larger game about to begin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>I was playing an opponent of recognizably less ability than Vlosmin when I
heard a stirring and murmuring in the crowd around my stand. The stirring was
punctuated by my opponent rising to his feet.</p>

<p>I glanced up.</p>

<p>The big man who had walked into my booth was neither arrogant nor
condescending, yet the confidence in his manner was like an aura of strength.
He had a deep reserve of vitality, I noted as I studied him carefully, but it
was a leashed, controlled vitality. Like most of the men of the Veldian race he
wore a uniform, cut severely plain, and undecorated. No flowing robes or tunics
for these men. They were a warrior race, unconcerned with the aesthetic touches
of personal dress, and left that strictly to their women.</p>

<p>The newcomer turned to my late opponent. His voice was impressive,
controlled. &quot;Please finish your game,&quot; he said courteously.</p>

<p>The other shook his head. &quot;The game is already as good as over. My
sword is broken. You are welcome to my place.&quot;</p>

<p>The tall man turned to me. &quot;If you don't mind?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My pleasure,&quot; I answered. &quot;Please be seated.&quot;</p>

<p>This was it.</p>

<p>My visitor shrugged his close wrapped cloak back from his shoulders and took
the chair opposite me. &quot;I am Kalin Trobt,&quot; he said. As if he knew I
had been expecting him.</p>

<p>In reply I came near to telling him my correct name. But Robert O. Lang was
a name that would have been alien to Velda. Using it would have been as good as
a confession. &quot;Claustil Anteer,&quot; I said, giving a name I had invented
earlier.</p>

<p>We played the first game as children play it, taking each other's pukts as
the opportunity presented, making no attempt at finesse. Trobt won, two up.
Neither of us had made mention of a wager. There would be more than money
involved in this Game.</p>

<p>I noticed, when I glanced up before the second game, that the spectators had
been cleared from around the booth. Only the inner, unmoving ring I had
observed earlier remained now. They watched calmly—professionally.</p>

<p>Fortunately I had no intention of trying to escape.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>During the early part of the second game Trobt and I tested each other
carefully, as skilled swordsmen, probing, feinting, and shamming attack, but
never actually exposing ourselves. I detected what could have been a slight
tendency to gamble in Trobt's game, but there was no concrete situation to
confirm it.</p>

<p>My first moves were entirely passive. Alertly passive. If I had judged
correctly the character of the big man opposite me, I had only to ignore the
bait he offered to draw me out, to disregard his openings and apparent—too
apparent—errors, until he became convinced that I was unshakably cautious, and
not to be tempted into making the first thrusts. For this was his weakness as I
had guessed it: That his was a gambling temperament—that when he saw an opportunity
he would strike—without the caution necessary to insure safety.</p>

<p>Pretending to move with timidity, and pausing with great deliberation over
even the most obvious plays, I maneuvered only to defend. Each time Trobt
shifted to a new position of attack I covered—until finally I detected the use
of slightly more arm force than necessary when he moved a pukt. It was the only
sign of impatience he gave, but I knew it was there.</p>

<p>Then it was that I left one—thin—opening.</p>

<p>Trobt streaked a pukt through and cut out one of my middle defenders.</p>

<p>Instead of making the obvious counter of taking his piece, I played a pukt
far removed from his invading man. He frowned in concentration, lifted his
arm—and his hand hung suspended over the board.</p>

<p>Suddenly his eyes widened. His glance swept upward to my face and what he
saw there caused his expression to change to one of mingled dismay and
astonishment. There was but one move he could make. When he made it his entire
left flank would be exposed. He had lost the game.</p>

<p>Abruptly he reached forward, touched his index finger to the tip of my nose,
and pressed gently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>After a minute during which neither of us spoke, I said, &quot;You
know?&quot;</p>

<p>He nodded. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said. &quot;You're a Human.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a stir and rustle of motion around me. The ring of spectators had
leaned forward a little as they heard his words. I looked up and saw that they
were smiling, inspecting me with curiosity and something that could have been
called admiration. In the dusk the clearest view was the ring of teeth,
gleaming—the view a rabbit might get of a circle of grinning foxes. Foxes might
feel friendly toward rabbits, and admire a good big one. Why not?</p>

<p>I suppressed an ineffectual impulse to deny what I was. The time was past
for that. &quot;How did you find out?&quot; I asked Trobt.</p>

<p>&quot;Your Game. No one could play like that and not be well known. And now
your nose.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My nose?&quot; I repeated.</p>

<p>&quot;Only one physical difference between a Human and a Veldian is apparent
on the surface. The nose cartilage. Yours is split—mine is single.&quot; He
rose to his feet. &quot;Will you come with me, please?&quot;</p>

<p>It was not a request.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>My guards walked singly and in couples, sometimes passing Trobt and myself,
sometimes letting us pass them, and sometimes lingering at a booth, like any
other walkers, and yet, unobtrusively they held me encircled, always in the
center of the group. I had already learned enough of the Veldian personality to
realize that this was simply a habit of tact. Tact to prevent an arrest from
being conspicuous, so as not to add the gaze of his fellows to whatever
punishment would be decided for a culprit's offense. Apparently they considered
humiliation too deep a punishment to use indiscriminately.</p>

<p>At the edge of the Fair grounds some of the watchers bunched around me while
others went to get the tricars. I stood and looked across the park to The City.
That was what it was called, The City, The Citadel, The Hearthplace, the home
place where one's family is kept safe, the sanctuary whose walls have never
been pierced. All those connotations had been in the name and the use of the
name; in the voices of those who spoke it. Sometimes they called it The Hearth,
and sometimes The Market, always <i>The </i>as if it were the only one.</p>

<p>Though the speakers lived in other places and named them as the homes of
their ancestors, most of the Veldians were born here. Their history was
colored, I might say even shaped, by their long era of struggle with the
dleeth, a four-footed, hairy carnivore, physically little different from the
big cats of Earth, but intelligent. They had battled the Veldians in a struggle
for survival from the Veldians' earliest memories until a couple centuries
before my visit. Now the last few surviving dleeth had found refuge in the
frigid region of the north pole. With their physical superiority they probably
would have won the struggle against the Veldians, except that their instincts
had been purely predatory, and they had no hands and could not develop
technology.</p>

<p>The City had been the one strong point that the dleeth had never been able
to breach. It had been held by one of the stronger clans, and there was seldom
unity among the tribes, yet any family about to bear a child was given
sanctuary within its walls.</p>

<p>The clans were nomads—made so by the aggression of the dleeth—but they
always made every effort to reach The City when childbirth was imminent. This
explained, at least partly, why even strangers from foreign areas regarded The
City as their home place.</p>

<p>I could see the Games Building from where I stood. In the walled city called
Hearth it was the highest point. Big and red, it towered above the others, and
the city around it rose to it like a wave, its consort of surrounding smaller
buildings matched to each other in size and shape in concentric rings. Around
each building wound the ramps of elevator runways, harmonious and useful, each
of different colored stone, lending variety and warmth. Nowhere was there a
clash of either proportion or color. Sometimes I wondered if the Veldians did
not build more for the joy of creating symmetry, than because of utilitarian
need.</p>

<p>I climbed into Trobt's thee-wheeled car as it stopped before me, and the
minute I settled into the bucket seat and gripped the bracing handles, Trobt
spun the car and it dived into the highway and rushed toward the city. The
vehicle seemed unstable, being about the width of a motor bike, with side car
in front, and having nothing behind except a metal box that must have housed a
powerful battery, and a shaft with the rear wheel that did the steering. It was
an arrangement that made possible sudden wrenching turns that were battering to
any passenger as unused to it as I. To my conditioning it seemed that the
Veldians on the highway drove like madmen, the traffic rules were
incomprehensible or nonexistent, and all drivers seemed determined to drive
only in gull-like sweeping lines, giving no obvious change of course for other
such cars, brushing by tricars from the opposite direction with an inch or less
of clearance.</p>

<p>Apparently the maneuverability of the cars and the skill of the drivers were
enough to prevent accidents, and I had to force my totally illogical drivers'
reflexes to relax and stop tensing against the nonexistent peril.</p>

<p>I studied Trobt as he drove, noting the casual way he held the wheel, and
the assurance in the set of his shoulders. I tried to form a picture in my mind
of the kind of man he was, and just what were the motivations that would move
or drive him.</p>

<p>Physically he was a long-faced man, with a smooth muscular symmetry, and an
Asiatic cast to his eyes. I was certain that he excelled at whatever job he
held. In fact I was prepared to believe that he would excel at anything he
tried. He was undoubtedly one of those amazing men for whom the exceptional was
mere routine. If he were to be cast in the role of my opponent: be the person
in whom the opposition of this race would be actualized—as I now anticipated—I
would not have wanted to bet against him.</p>

<p>The big skilled man was silent for several minutes, weaving the tricar with
smooth swerves through a three-way tangle at an intersection, but twice he
glanced at my expression with evident curiosity. Finally, as a man would state
an obvious fact he said, &quot;I presume you know you will be executed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>Trobt's face reflected surprise at the shock he must have read in mine. I
had known the risk I would be taking in coming here, of course, and of the very
real danger that it might end in my death. But this had come up on me too fast.
I had not realized that the affair had progressed to the point where my death
was already assured. I had thought that there would be negotiations,
consultations, and perhaps ultimatums. But only if they failed did I believe
that the repercussions might carry me along to my death.</p>

<p>However, there was the possibility that Trobt was merely testing my courage.
I decided on boldness. &quot;No,&quot; I said. &quot;I do not expect to be
executed.&quot;</p>

<p>Trobt raised his eyebrows and slowed, presumably to gain more time to talk.
With a sudden decision he swung the tricar from the road into one of the small
parks spread at regular intervals along the highway.</p>

<p>&quot;Surely you don't think we would let you live? There's a state of war
between Velda and your Ten Thousand Worlds. You admit that you're Human, and
obviously you are here to spy. Yet when you're captured, you do not expect to
be executed?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Was I captured?&quot; I asked, emphasizing the last word.</p>

<p>He pondered on that a moment, but apparently did not come up with an answer
that satisfied him. &quot;I presume your question means something,&quot; he
said.</p>

<p>&quot;If I had wanted to keep my presence here a secret, would I have set up
a booth at the Fair and invited inspection?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>He waved one hand irritably, as though to brush aside a picayune argument.
&quot;Obviously you did it to test yourself against us, to draw the great under
your eye, and perhaps become a friend, treated as an equal with access to
knowledge of our plans and weapons. Certainly! Your tactic drew two members of
the Council into your net before it was understood. If we had accepted you as a
previously unknown Great, you would have won. You are a gambling man, and you
played a gambler's hand. You lost.&quot;</p>

<p>Partly he was right.</p>

<p>&quot;My deliberate purpose was to reach you,&quot; I said, &quot;or someone
else with sufficient authority to listen to what I have to say.&quot;</p>

<p>Trobt pulled the vehicle deeper into the park. He watched the cars of our
escort settling to rest before and behind us. I detected a slight unease and
rigidity in his stillness as he said, &quot;Speak then. I'm listening.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've come to negotiate,&quot; I told him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>Something like a flash of puzzlement crossed his features before they
returned to tighter immobility. Unexpectedly he spoke in <i>Earthian, </i>my
own language. &quot;Then why did you choose this method? Would it not have been
better simply to announce yourself?&quot;</p>

<p>This was the first hint he had given that he might have visited our Worlds
before I visited his. Though we had suspected before I came that some of them
must have. They probably knew of our existence years before we discovered them.</p>

<p>Ignoring his change of language, I replied, still speaking Veldian,
&quot;Would it have been that simple? Or would some minor official, on
capturing me, perhaps have had me imprisoned, or tortured to extract
information?&quot;</p>

<p>Again the suppressed puzzlement in the shift of position as he looked at me.
&quot;They would have treated you as an envoy, representing your Ten Thousand
Worlds. You could have spoken to the Council immediately.&quot; He spoke in
Veldian now.</p>

<p>&quot;I did not know that,&quot; I said. &quot;You refused to receive our
fleet envoys; why should I expect you to accept me any more readily?&quot;</p>

<p>Trobt started to speak, stopped, and turned in his seat to regard me levelly
and steadily, his expression unreadable. &quot;Tell me what you have to say
then. I will judge whether or not the Council will listen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To begin with—&quot; I looked away from the expressionless eyes, out
the windshield, down the vistas of brown short trees that grew between each
small park and the next. &quot;Until an exploring party of ours found signs of
extensive mining operations on a small metal-rich planet, we knew nothing of
your existence. We were not even aware that another race in the galaxy had
discovered faster than light space travel. But after the first clue we were
alert for other signs, and found them. Our discovery of your planet was bound
to come. However, we did not expect to be met on our first visit with an attack
of such hostility as you displayed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When we learned that you had found us,&quot; Trobt said, &quot;we sent
a message to your Ten Thousand Worlds, warning them that we wanted no contact
with you. Yet you sent a fleet of spaceships against us.&quot;</p>

<p>I hesitated before answering. &quot;That phrase, 'sent against us,' is
hardly the correct one,&quot; I said. &quot;The fleet was sent for a diplomatic
visit, and was not meant as an aggressive action.&quot; I thought, <i>But
obviously the display of force was intended &quot;diplomatically&quot; to
frighten you people into being polite. </i>In diplomacy the smile, the extended
hand—and the big stick visible in the other hand—had obviated many a war, by
giving the stranger a chance to choose a hand, in full understanding of the
alternative. <i>We showed our muscle to your little planet—you showed your
muscle. And now we are ready to be polite.</i>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>I hoped these people would understand the face-saving ritual of negotiation,
the disclaimers of intent, that would enable each side to claim that there had
been no war, merely accident.</p>

<p>&quot;We did not at all feel that you were justified in wiping the fleet
from space,&quot; I said. &quot;But it was probably a legitimate
misunderstanding—&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You had been warned!&quot; Trobt's voice was grim, his expression not
inviting of further discussion. I thought I detected a bunching of the muscles
in his arms.</p>

<p>For a minute I said nothing, made no gesture. Apparently this angle of
approach was unproductive—and probably explosive. Also, trying to explain and
justify the behavior of the Federation politicos could possibly become rather
taxing.</p>

<p>&quot;Surely you don't intend to postpone negotiations indefinitely?&quot; I
asked tentatively. &quot;One planet cannot conquer the entire Federation.&quot;</p>

<p>The bunched muscles of his arms strained until they pulled his shoulders,
and his lips whitened with the effort of controlling some savage anger.
Apparently my question had impugned his pride.</p>

<p>This, I decided quickly, was not the time to make an enemy. &quot;I
apologize if I have insulted you,&quot; I said in Earthian. &quot;I do not yet
always understand what I am saying, in your language.&quot;</p>

<p>He hesitated, made some kind of effort, and shifted to Earthian. &quot;It is
not a matter of strength, or weakness,&quot; he said, letting his words ride
out on his released breath, &quot;but of behavior, courtesy. </p>

<p>&quot;We would have left you alone, but now it is too late. We will drive
your faces into the ground. I am certain that we can, but if we could not,
still we would try. To imply that we would not try, from fear, seems to me
words to soil the mouth, not worthy of a man speaking to a man. We are
converting our ships of commerce to war. Your people will see soon that we will
fight.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>&quot;Is it too late for negotiation?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>His forehead wrinkled into a frown and he stared at me in an effort of
concentration. When he spoke it was with a considered hesitation. &quot;If I
make a great effort I can feel that you are sincere, and not speaking to mock
or insult. It is strange that beings who look so much like ourselves
can&quot;—he rubbed a hand across his eyes—&quot;pause a moment. When I say
'yag loogt'-n'balt' what does it mean to you in Earthish?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I must play.&quot; I hesitated as he turned one hand palm down,
signifying that I was wrong. &quot;I must duel,&quot; I said, finding another
meaning in the way I had heard the phrase expressed. It was a<b> </b>strong
meaning, judging by the tone and inflection the speaker had used. I had
mimicked the tone without full understanding. The verb was perhaps stronger
than <i>must, </i>meaning something inescapable, fated, but I could find no
Earthian verb for it. I understood why Trobt dropped his hand to the seat
without turning it palm up to signify that I was correct.</p>

<p>&quot;There may be no such thought on the human worlds,&quot; he said
resignedly. &quot;I have to explain as to a child or a madman. I cannot explain
in Veldian, for it has no word to explain what needs no explanation.&quot;</p>

<p>He shifted to Earthian, his controlled voice sounding less controlled when
moving with the more fluid inflections of my own tongue. &quot;We said we did
not want further contact. Nevertheless you sent the ships—deliberately in
disregard of our expressed desire. That was an insult, a deep insult, meaning
we have not strength to defend our word, meaning we are so helpless that we can
be treated with impoliteness, like prisoners, or infants.</p>

<p>&quot;Now we must show you which of us is helpless, which is the weakling.
Since you would not respect our wishes, then in order to be not-further-insulted
we must make of your people a captive or a child in helplessness, so that you
will be without power to affront us another time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If apologies are in order—&quot;</p>

<p>He interrupted with raised hand, still looking at me very earnestly with
forehead wrinkled, thought half turned inward in difficult introspection of his
own meaning, as well as a grasping for my viewpoint.</p>

<p>&quot;The insult of the fleet can only be wiped out in the blood of
testing—of battle—and the test will not stop until one or the other shows that
he is too weak to struggle. There is no other way.&quot;</p>

<p>He was demanding total surrender!</p>

<p>I saw it was a subject that could not be debated. The Federation had taken
on a bearcat this time!</p>

<p>&quot;I stopped because I wanted to understand you,&quot; Trobt resumed.
&quot;Because the others will not understand how you could be an envoy—how your
Federation could send an envoy—except as an insult. I have seen enough of human
strangeness to be not maddened by the insolence of an emissary coming to us, or
by your people expecting us to exchange words when we carry your first insult
still unwashed from our face. I can even see how it could perhaps be considered
<i>not </i>an insult, for I have seen your people living on their planets and
they suffered insult from each other without striking, until finally I saw that
they did not know when they were insulted, as a deaf man does not know when his
name is called.&quot;</p>

<p>I listened to the quiet note of his voice, trying to recognize the attitude
that made it different from his previous tones—calm and slow and deep.
Certainty that what he was saying was
important&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;conscious
tolerance&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;generosity.</p>

<p>Trobt turned on the tricar's motor and put his hands on the steering shaft.
&quot;You are a man worthy of respect,&quot; he said, looking down the dark
empty road ahead. &quot;I wanted you to understand us. To see the difference
between us. So that you will not think us without justice.&quot; The car began
to move.</p>

<p>&quot;I wanted you to understand why you will die.&quot;</p>

<p>I said nothing—having nothing to say. But I began immediately to bring my
report up to date, recording the observations during the games, and recording
with care this last conversation, with the explanation it carried of the Veldian
reactions that had been previously obscure.</p>

<p>I used nerve-twitch code, &quot;typing&quot; on a tape somewhere inside
myself the coded record of everything that had passed since the last time I
brought the report up to date. The typing was easy, like flexing a finger in
code jerks, but I did not know exactly where the recorder was located. It was
some form of transparent plastic which would not show up on X ray. The surgeons
had imbedded it in my flesh while I was unconscious, and had implanted a mental
block against my noticing which small muscle had been linked into the
contrivance for the typing.</p>

<p>If I died before I was able to return to Earth, there were several capsuled
chemicals buried at various places in my body, that intermingled, would
temporarily convert my body to a battery for a high powered broadcast of the
tape report, destroying the tape and my body together. This would go into
action only if my temperature fell fifteen degrees below the temperature of
life.</p>

<p>I became aware that Kalin Trobt was speaking again, and that I had let my
attention wander while recording, and taped some subjective material. The code
twitches easily became an unconscious accompaniment to memory and thought, and
this was the second time I had found myself recording more than necessary.</p>

<p>Trobt watched the dark road, threading among buildings and past darkened
vehicles. His voice was thoughtful. &quot;In the early days, Miklas of Danlee,
when he had the Ornan family surrounded and outnumbered, wished not to destroy
them, for he needed good warriors, and in another circumstance they could have
been his friends. Therefore he sent a slave to them with an offer of terms of
peace. The Oman family had the slave skinned while alive, smeared with salt and
grease so that he would not bleed, and sent back, tied in a bag of his own
skin, with a message of no. The chroniclers agree that since the Ornan family
was known to be honorable, Miklas should not have made the offer.</p>

<p>&quot;In another time and battle, the Cheldos were offered terms of
surrender by an envoy. Nevertheless they won against superior forces, and gave
their captives to eat a stew whose meat was the envoy of the offer to
surrender. Being given to eat their own words as you'd say in Earthish. Such
things are not done often, because the offer is not given.&quot;</p>

<p>He wrenched the steering post sideways and the tricar turned almost at right
angles, balanced on one wheel for a dizzy moment, and fled up a great spiral
ramp winding around the outside of the red Games Building.</p>

<p>Trobt still looked ahead, not glancing at me. &quot;I understand, from
observing them, that you Earthians will lie without soiling the mouth. What are
you here for, actually?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I came from interest, but I intend, given the opportunity, to observe
and to report my observations back to my government. They should not enter a
war without knowing anything about you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good.&quot; He wrenched the car around another abrupt turn into a red
archway in the side of the building, bringing it to a stop inside. The sound of
the other tricars entering the tunnel echoed hollowly from the walls and died
as they came to a stop around us. &quot;You are a spy then.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I said, getting out. I had silently resigned my commission
as envoy some five minutes earlier. There was little point in delivering
political messages, if they have no result except to have one skinned or made
into a stew.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>A heavy door with the seal of an important official engraved upon it opened
before us. In the forepart of the room we entered, a slim-bodied creature with
the face of a girl sat with crossed legs on a platform like a long coffee
table, sorting vellum marked with the dots and dashes, arrows and pictures, of
the Veldian language.</p>

<p>She had green eyes, honeyed-olive complexion, a red mouth, and purple black
hair. She stopped to work an abacus, made a notation on one of the stiff sheets
of vellum, then glanced up to see who had come in. She saw us, and glanced away
again, as if she had coolly made a note of our presence and gone back to her
work, sorting the vellum sheets and stacking them in thin shelves with quick
graceful motions.</p>

<p>&quot;Kalin Trobt of Pagael,&quot; a man on the far side of the room said, a
man sitting cross-legged on a dais covered with brown fur and scattered papers.
He accepted the hand Trobt extended and they gripped wrists in a locked gesture
of friendship. &quot;And how survive the other sons of the citadel of
Pagael?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, and continuing in friendship to the house of Lyagin,&quot; Trobt
replied carefully. &quot;I have seen little of my kin. There are many
farlanders all around us, and between myself and my hearth-folk swarm the
adopted.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is not like the old days, Kalin Trobt. In a dream I saw a rock sink
from the weight of sons, and I longed for the sight of a land that is without
strangers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We are all kinfolk now, Lyagin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My hearth pledged it.&quot;</p>

<p>Lyagin put his hand on a stack of missives which he had been considering,
his face thoughtful, sparsely fleshed, mostly skull and tendon, his hair bound
back from his face, and wearing a short white cotton dress beneath a light fur
cape.</p>

<p>He was an old man, already in his senility, and now he was lost in a lapse
of awareness of what he had been doing a moment before. By no sign did Trobt
show impatience, or even consciousness of the other's lapse.</p>

<p>Lyagin raised his head after a minute and brought his rheumy eyes into focus
on us. &quot;You bring someone in regard to an inquiry?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;The one from the Ten Thousand Worlds,&quot; Trobt replied.</p>

<p>Lyagin nodded apologetically. &quot;I received word that he would be
brought,&quot; he said. &quot;How did you capture him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He came.&quot;</p>

<p>The expression must have had some connotation that I did not recognize for
the official let his glance cross mine, and I caught one slight flicker of
interest in his eyes. &quot;You say these Humans lie?&quot; he asked Trobt.</p>

<p>&quot;Frequently. It is considered almost honorable to lie to an enemy in
circumstances where one may profit by it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You brought back from his worlds some poison which insures their
speaking the truth, I believe?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not a poison, something they call drugs, which affects one like strong
drink, dulling a man and changing what he might do. Under its influence he
loses his initiative of decision.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have this with you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; Trobt was going to waste no time getting from me anything I
had that might be of value to them.</p>

<p>&quot;It will be interesting having an enemy co-operate,&quot; Lyagin said.
&quot;If he finds no way to kill himself, he can be very useful to us.&quot; So
far my contact with the Veldians had not been going at all as I had hoped and
planned.</p>

<p>The boy-girl at the opposite side of the room finished a problem on the
abacus, noted the answer, and glanced directly at my face, at my expression,
then locked eyes with me for a brief moment. When she glanced down to the
vellum again it was as if she had seen whatever she had looked up to see, and
was content. She sat a little straighter as she worked, and moved with an
action that was a little less supple and compliant.</p>

<p>I believe she had seen me as a man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>During the questioning I made no attempt to resist the drug's influence. I
answered truthfully—but literally. Many times my answers were
undecidable—because I knew not the answers, or I lacked the data to give them.
And the others were cloaked under a full literal subtlety that made them
useless to the Veldians. Questions such as the degree of unity existing between
the Worlds: I answered—truthfully—that they were united under an authority with
supreme power of decision. The fact that that authority had no actual force
behind it; that it was subject to the whims and fluctuations of sentiment and
politics of intraalliances; that it had deteriorated into a mere supernumerary
body of impractical theorists that occupied itself, in a practical sphere, only
with picayune matters, I did not explain. It was not asked of me.</p>

<p>Would our Worlds fight? I answered that they would fight to the death to
defend their liberty and independence. I did not add that that will to fight
would evidence itself first in internecine bickering, procrastinations, and
jockeying to avoid the worst thrusts of the enemy—before it finally resolved
itself into a united front against attack.</p>

<p>By early morning Trobt could no longer contain his impatience. He stepped
closer. &quot;We're going to learn one thing,&quot; he said, and his voice was
harsh. &quot;Why did you come here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To learn all that I could about you,&quot; I answered.</p>

<p>&quot;You came to find a way to whip us!&quot;</p>

<p>It was not a question and I had no necessity to answer.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you found the way?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you do, and you are able, will you use that knowledge to kill
us?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>Trobt's eyebrows raised. &quot;No?&quot; he repeated. &quot;Then why do you
want it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope to find a solution that will not harm either side.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But if you found that a solution was not possible, you would be
willing to use your knowledge to defeat us?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even if it meant that you had to exterminate us—man, woman, and
child?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why? Are you so certain that you are right, that you walk with God,
and that we are knaves?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If the necessity to destroy one civilization or the other arose, and
the decision were mine to make, I would rule against you because of the number
of sentient beings involved.&quot;</p>

<p>Trobt cut the argument out from under me. &quot;What if the situation were
reversed, and your side was in the minority? Would you choose to let them
die?&quot;</p>

<p>I bowed my head as I gave him the truthful answer. &quot;I would choose for
my own side, no matter what the circumstances.&quot;</p>

<p>The interrogation was over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>On the drive to Trobt's home I was dead tired, and must have slept for a few
minutes with my eyes open. With a start I heard Trobt say, &quot;. . . that a
man with ability enough to be a games—chess—master is given no authority over
his people, but merely consulted on occasional abstract questions of
tactics.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is the nature of the problem.&quot; I caught the gist of his
comment from his last words and did my best to answer it. I wanted nothing less
than to engage in conversation, but I realized that the interest he was showing
now was just the kind I had tried to guide him to, earlier in the evening. If I
could get him to understand us better, our motivations and ideals, perhaps even
our frailties, there would be more hope for a compatible meeting of minds.
&quot;Among peoples of such mixed natures, such diverse histories and
philosophies, and different ways of life, most administrative problems are problems
of a choice of whims, of changing and conflicting goals; not <i>how </i>to do
what a people want done, but <i>what </i>they want done, and whether their next
generation will want it enough to make work on it, now, worthwhile.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They sound insane,&quot; Trobt said. &quot;Are your administrators
supposed to serve the flickering goals of demented minds?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We must weigh values. What is considered good may be a matter of
viewpoint, and may change from place to place, from generation to generation.
In determining what people feel and what their unvoiced wants are, a talent of
strategy, and an impatience with the illogic of others, are not
qualifications.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The good is good, how can it change?&quot; Trobt asked. &quot;I do not
understand.&quot;</p>

<p>I saw that truly he could not understand, since he had seen nothing of the
clash of philosophies among a mixed people. I tried to think of ways it could
be explained; how to show him that a people who let their emotions control them
more than their logic, would unavoidably do many things they could not justify
or take pride in—but that that emotional predominance was what had enabled them
to grow, and spread throughout their part of the galaxy—and be, in the main,
happy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>I was tired, achingly tired. More, the events of the long day, and Velda's
heavier gravity had taken me to the last stages of exhaustion. Yet I wanted to
keep that weakness from Trobt. It was possible that he, and the other Veldians,
would judge the Humans by what they observed in me.</p>

<p>Trobt's attention was on his driving and he did not notice that I followed
his conversation only with difficulty. &quot;Have you had only the two weeks of
practice in the Game, since you came?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>I kept my eyes open with an effort and breathed deeply. Velda's one
continent, capping the planet on its upper third; merely touched what would
have been a temperate zone. During its short summer its mean temperature hung
in the low sixties. At night it dropped to near freezing. The cold night air
bit into my lungs and drove the fog of exhaustion from my brain.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; I answered Trobt's question. &quot;I learned it before I
came. A chess adept wrote me, in answer to an article on chess, that a man from
one of the outworlds had shown him a game of greater richness and flexibility
than chess, with much the same feeling to the player, and had beaten him in
three games of chess after only two games to learn it, and had said that on his
own planet this chesslike game was the basis for the amount of authority with
which a man is invested. The stranger would not name his planet.</p>

<p>&quot;I hired an investigating agency to learn the whereabouts of this
planet. There was none in the Ten Thousand Worlds. That meant that the man had
been a very ingenious liar, or—that he had come from Velda.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was I, of course,&quot; Trobt acknowledged.</p>

<p>&quot;I realized that from your conversation. The sender of the
letter,&quot; I resumed, &quot;was known to me as a chess champion of two
Worlds. The matter tantalized my thoughts for weeks, and finally I decided to
try to arrange a visit to Velda. If you had this game, I wanted to try myself
against your skilled ones.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand that desire very well,&quot; Trobt said. &quot;The same
temptation caused me to be indiscreet when I visited your Worlds. I have seldom
been able to resist the opportunity for an intellectual gambit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It wasn't much more than a guess that I would find the Game on
Velda,&quot; I said. &quot;But the lure was too strong for me to pass it
by.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even if you came intending to challenge, you had little enough time to
learn to play as you have—against men who have spent lifetimes learning. I'd
like to try you again soon, if I may.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly.&quot; I was in little mood or condition to welcome any
further polite conversation. And I did not appreciate the irony of his
request—to the best of my knowledge I was still under a sentence of early
death.</p>

<p>Trobt must have caught the bleakness in my reply for he glanced quickly over
his shoulder at me. &quot;There will be time,&quot; he said, gently for him.
&quot;Several days at least. You will be my guest.&quot; I knew that he was
doing his best to be kind. His decision that I must die had not been prompted
by any meanness of nature: To him it was only—inevitable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>The next day I sat at one end of a Games table in a side wing of his home
while Trobt leaned against the wall to my left. &quot;Having a like nature I
can well understand the impulse that brought you here,&quot; he said. &quot;The
supreme gamble. Playing—with your life the stake in the game. Nothing you've
ever experienced can compare with it. And even now—when you have lost, and will
die—you do not regret it, I'm certain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm afraid you're overestimating my courage, and misinterpreting my
intentions,&quot; I told him, feeling instinctively that this would be a good
time to again present my arguments. &quot;I came because I hoped to reach a
better understanding. We feel that an absolutely unnecessary war, with its
resulting death and destruction, would be foolhardy. And I fail to see your
viewpoint. Much of it strikes me as stupid racial pride.&quot;</p>

<p>Trobt ignored the taunt. &quot;The news of your coming is the first topic of
conversation in The City,&quot; he said. &quot;The clans understand that you
have come to challenge; one man against a nation. They greatly admire your
audacity.&quot;</p>

<p>Look,&quot; I said, becoming angry and slipping into Earthian. &quot;I don't
know whether you consider me a damn fool or not. But if you think I came here
expecting to die; that I'm looking forward to it with pleasure—&quot;</p>

<p>He stopped me with an idle gesture of one hand. &quot;You deceive yourself
if you believe what you say,&quot; he commented. &quot;Tell me this: Would you
have stayed away if you had known just how great the risk was to be?&quot;</p>

<p>I was surprised to find that I did not have a ready answer to his question.</p>

<p>&quot;Shall we play?&quot; Trobt asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>We played three games; Trobt with great skill, employing diversified and
ingenious attacks. But he still had that bit too much audacity in his
execution. I won each time.</p>

<p>&quot;You're undoubtedly a Master,&quot; Trobt said at the end of the third
game. &quot;But that isn't all of it. Would you like me to tell you why I can't
beat you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can you?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I think so,&quot; he said. &quot;I wanted to try against you again and
again, because each time it did not seem that you had defeated me, but only
that I had played badly, made childish blunders, and that I lost each game
before we ever came to grips. Yet when I entered the duel against you a further
time, I'd begin to blunder again.&quot;</p>

<p>He shoved his hands more deeply under his weapons belt, leaning back and
observing me with his direct inspection. &quot;My blundering then has to do
with you, rather than myself,&quot; he said. &quot;Your play is excellent, of
course, but there is more beneath the surface than above. This is your talent:
You lose the first game to see an opponent's weakness—and play it against
him.&quot;</p>

<p>I could not deny it. But neither would I concede it. Any small advantage I
might hold would be sorely needed later.</p>

<p>&quot;I understand Humans a little,&quot; Trobt said. &quot;Enough to know
that very few of them would come to challenge us without some other purpose.
They have no taste for death, with glory or without.&quot;</p>

<p>Again I did not reply.</p>

<p>&quot;I believe,&quot; Trobt said, &quot;that you came here to challenge in
your own way, which is to find any weakness we might have, either in our
military, or in some odd way, in our very selves.&quot;</p>

<p>Once again—with a minimum of help from me—he had arrived in his reasoning at
a correct answer. From here on—against this man—I would have to walk a narrow
line.</p>

<p>&quot;I think,&quot; Trobt said more slowly, glancing down at the board
between us,<i> </i>then back at my expression, &quot;that this may be the First
Game, and that you are more dangerous than you seem, that you are accepting the
humiliation of allowing yourself to be thought of as weaker than you are, in
actuality. You intend to find our weakness, and you expect somehow to tell your
states what you find.&quot;</p>

<p>I looked across at him without moving. &quot;What weakness do you fear I've
seen?&quot; I countered.</p>

<p>Trobt placed his hands carefully on the board in front of him and rose to
his feet. Before he could say what he intended a small boy pulling something
like a toy riding-horse behind him came into the game room and grabbed Trobt's
trouser leg. He was the first blond child I had seen on Velda.</p>

<p>The boy pointed at the swords on the wall. &quot;Da,&quot; he said
beseechingly, making reaching motions. &quot;Da.&quot;</p>

<p>Trobt kept his attention on me. After a moment a faint humorless smile moved
his lips. He seemed to grow taller, with the impression a strong man gives when
he remembers his strength. &quot;You will find no weakness,&quot; he said. He
sat down again and placed the child on his lap.</p>

<p>The boy grabbed immediately at the abacus hanging on Trobt's belt and began
playing with it, while Trobt stroked his hair. All the Veldians dearly loved
children, I had noticed.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you have any idea how many of our ships were used to wipe out your
fleet?&quot; he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>As I allowed myself to show the interest I felt he put a hand on the boy's
shoulder and leaned forward. &quot;One,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>I very nearly called Trobt a liar—one ship obliterating a thousand—before I
remembered that Veldians were not liars, and that Trobt obviously was not
lying. Somehow this small under-populated planet had developed a science of
weapons that vastly exceeded that of the Ten Thousand Worlds.</p>

<p>I had thought that perhaps my vacation on this Games-mad planet would result
in some mutual information that would bring quick negotiation or conciliation:
That players of a chesslike game would be easy to approach: That I would meet
men intelligent enough to see the absurdity of such an ill-fated war against
the overwhelming odds of the Ten Thousand Worlds Federation. Intelligent enough
to foresee the disaster that would result from such a fight. It began to look
as if the disaster might be to the Ten Thousand and not to the one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>Thinking, I walked alone in Trobt's roof garden.</p>

<p>Walking in Velda's heavy gravity took more energy than I cared to expend,
but too long a period without exercise brought a dull ache to the muscles of my
shoulders and at the base of my neck.</p>

<p>This was my third evening in the house. I had slept at least ten hours each
night since I arrived, and found myself exhausted at day's end, unless I was
able to take a nap or lie down during the afternoon.</p>

<p>The flowers and shrubbery in the garden seemed to feel the weight of gravity
also, for most of them grew low, and many sent creepers out along the ground.
Overhead strange formations of stars clustered thickly and shed a glow on the
garden very like Earth's moonlight.</p>

<p>I was just beginning to feel the heavy drag in my leg tendons when a woman's
voice said, &quot;Why don't you rest a while?&quot; It spun me around as I
looked for the source of the voice.</p>

<p>I found her in a nook in the bushes, seated on a contour chair that allowed
her to stretch out in a half-reclining position. She must have weighed near to
two hundred—Earth-weight—pounds.</p>

<p>But the thing that had startled me more than the sound of her voice was that
she had spoken in the universal language of the Ten Thousand Worlds. And
without accent!</p>

<p>&quot;You're—?&quot; I started to ask.</p>

<p>&quot;Human,&quot; she finished for me.</p>

<p>&quot;How did you get here?&quot; I inquired eagerly.</p>

<p>&quot;With my husband.&quot; She was obviously enjoying my astonishment. She
was a beautiful woman, in a gentle bovine way, and very friendly. Her blond
hair was done up in tight ringlets.</p>

<p>&quot;You mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Trobt?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; As I stood trying to phrase my wonderment into more
questions, she asked, &quot;You're the Earthman, aren't you?&quot;</p>

<p>I nodded. &quot;Are you from Earth?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; she answered. &quot;My home world is Mandel's Planet, in the
Thumb group.&quot;</p>

<p>She indicated a low hassock of a pair, and I seated myself on the lower and
leaned an elbow on the higher, beginning to smile. It would have been difficult
not to smile in the presence of anyone so contented. &quot;How did you meet
Trobt?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;It's a simple love story. Kalin visited Mandel—without revealing his
true identity of course—met, and courted me. I learned to love him, and agreed
to come to his world as his wife.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you know that he wasn't&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;That he . .
.&quot;<b><i> </i></b>I stumbled over just how to phrase the question. And
wondered if I should have started it.</p>

<p>Her teeth showed white and even as she smiled. She propped a pillow under
one plump arm and finished my sentence for me. &quot;. . . That he wasn't
Human?&quot; I was grateful for the way she put me at ease—almost as though we
had been old friends.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't know.&quot; For a moment she seemed to draw back into her
thoughts, as though searching for something she had almost forgotten. &quot;He
couldn't tell me. It was a secret he had to keep. When I arrived here and
learned that his planet wasn't a charted world, was not even Human, I was a
little uncertain and lonesome. But not frightened. I knew Kalin would never let
me be hurt. Even my lonesomeness left quickly. Kalin and I love each other very
deeply. I couldn't be more happy than I am now.&quot;</p>

<p>She seemed to see I did not consider that my question had been
answered—completely. &quot;You're wondering still if I mind that he isn't
Human, aren't you?&quot; she asked. &quot;Why should I? After all, what does it
mean to be 'Human'? It is only a word that differentiates one group of people
from another. I seldom think of the Veldians as being different—and certainly
never that they're beneath me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Does it bother you—if you'll pardon this curiosity of mine—that you
will never be able to bear Kalin's children?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The child you saw the first morning is my son,&quot; she answered
complacently.</p>

<p>&quot;But that's impossible,&quot; I blurted.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it?&quot; she asked. &quot;You saw the proof.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm no expert at this sort of thing,&quot; I said slowly, &quot;but
I've always understood that the possibility of two separate species producing
offspring was a million to one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Greater than that, probably,&quot; she agreed. &quot;But whatever the
odds, sooner or later the number is bound to come up. This was it.&quot;</p>

<p>I shook my head, but there was no arguing a fact. &quot;Wasn't it a bit
unusual that Kalin didn't marry a Veldian woman?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He has married—two of them,&quot; she answered. &quot;I'm his third
wife.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then they do practice polygamy,&quot; I said. &quot;Are you content
with such a marriage?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yes,&quot; she answered. &quot;You see, besides being very much
loved, I occupy a rather enviable position here. I,
ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot; She grew slightly flustered.
&quot;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the other women—the Veldian women—can bear
children only once every eight years, and during the other seven&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;
She hesitated again and I saw a tinge of red creep into her cheeks. She was
obviously embarrassed, but she laughed and resolutely went on.</p>

<p>&quot;During the other seven, they lose their feminine appearance, and don't
think of themselves as women. While I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot; I watched with
amusement as her color deepened and her glance dropped. &quot;I am always of
the same sex, as you might say, always a woman. My husband is the envy of all
his friends.&quot; </p>

<p>After her first reticence she talked freely, and I learned then the answer
to the riddle of the boy-girls of Velda. And at least one reason for their
great affection for children.</p>

<p>One year of fertility in eight . . .</p>

<p>Once again I saw the imprint of the voracious dleeth on this people's
culture. In their age-old struggle with their cold planet and its short growing
seasons—and more particularly with the dleeth—the Veldian women had been shaped
by evolution to better fit their environment. The women's strength could not be
spared for frequent childbearing—so childbearing had been limited. Further, one
small child could be carried in the frequent flights from the dleeth, but not
more than one. Nature had done its best to cope with the problem: In the off
seven years she tightened the women's flesh, atrophying glands and
organs—making them nonfunctional—and changing their bodies to be more fit to
labor and survive—and to fight, if necessary. It was an excellent
adaptation—for a time and environment where a low birth rate was an asset to
survival.</p>

<p>But this adaptation had left only a narrow margin for race perpetuation.
Each woman could bear only four children in her lifetime. That, I realized as
we talked, was the reason why the Veldians had not colonized other planets,
even though they had space flight—and why they probably never would, without a
drastic change in their biological make-up. That left so little ground for a
quarrel between them and the Ten Thousand Worlds. Yet here we were, poised to
spring into a death struggle.</p>

<p>&quot;You are a very unusual woman.&quot; My attention returned to Trobt's
wife. &quot;In a very unusual situation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; she accepted it as a compliment. She made ready to
rise. &quot;I hope you enjoy your visit here. And that I may see you again
before you return to Earth.&quot;</p>

<p>I realized then that she did not know of my peculiar position in her home. I
wondered if she knew even of the threat of war between us and her adopted
people. I decided not, or she would surely have spoken of it. Either Trobt had
deliberately avoided telling her, perhaps to spare her the pain it would have
caused, or she had noted that the topic of my presence was disturbing to him
and had tactfully refrained from inquiring. For just a moment I wondered if I
should explain everything to her, and have her use the influence she must have
with Trobt. I dismissed the idea as unworthy—and useless.</p>

<p>&quot;Good night,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>The next evening as we rode in a tricar Trobt asked if I would like to try
my skill against a better Games player.</p>

<p>&quot;I had assumed you were the best,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Only the second best,&quot; he answered. &quot;It would he interesting
to compare your game with that of our champion. If you can whip him, perhaps we
will have to revise our opinion of you Humans.&quot;</p>

<p>He spoke as though in jest, but I saw more behind his words than he intended
me to see. Here at last might be a chance to do a positive service for my side.
&quot;I would be happy to play,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>Trobt parked the tricar on a side avenue and we walked perhaps a hundred
yards. We stopped at the door of a small one-story stone house and Trobt tapped
with his fingernails on a hollow gong buried in the wood.</p>

<p>After a minute a curtain over the door glass was drawn back and an old woman
with straggly gray hair peered out at us. She recognized Trobt and opened the
door.</p>

<p>We went in. Neither Trobt nor the old woman spoke. She turned her back after
closing the door and went to stir embers in a stone grate.</p>

<p>Trobt motioned with his head for me to follow and led the way into a back
room.</p>

<p>&quot;Robert O. Lang,&quot; he said, &quot;I would like you to meet Yondtl.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>I looked across the room in the direction Trobt had indicated. My first
impression was of a great white blob, propped up on a couch and supported by
the wall at its back.</p>

<p>Then the thing moved. Moved its eyes. It was alive. Its eyes told me also
that it was a man. If I could call it a man.</p>

<p>His head was large and bloated, with blue eyes, washed almost colorless,
peering out of deep pouches of flesh. He seemed to have no neck; almost as
though his great head were merely an extension of the trunk, and separated only
by puffy folds of fat. Other lappings of flesh hung from his body in great
thick rolls.</p>

<p>It took another minute of fascinated inspection before I saw that he had no
arms, and that no legs reached from his body to the floor. The entire sight of
him made me want to leave the room and be sick.</p>

<p>&quot;Robert O. Lang is an Earthian who would challenge you, sir,&quot;
Trobt addressed the monstrosity.</p>

<p>The other gave no sign that I could see but Trobt went to pull a Games table
at the side of the room over toward us. &quot;I will serve as his hands,&quot;
Trobt said.</p>

<p>The pale blue eyes never left my face.</p>

<p>I stood without conscious thought until Trobt pushed a chair under me.
Mentally I shook myself. With unsteady hands—I had to do something with them—I
reached for the pukts before me. &quot;Do you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;do you
have a choice&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;of colors, sir?&quot; I stammered,
trying to make up for my earlier rudeness of staring.</p>

<p>The lips of the monstrosity quivered, but he made no reply.</p>

<p>All this while Trobt had been watching me with amusement. &quot;He is deaf
and speechless,&quot; Trobt said. &quot;Take either set. I will place the other
before him.&quot;</p>

<p>Absently I pulled the red pieces toward me and placed them on their squares.</p>

<p>&quot;In deference to you as a visitor, you will play 'second game
counts,&quot;' Trobt continued. He was still enjoying my consternation.
&quot;He always allows his opponent the first move. You may begin when you are
ready.&quot;</p>

<p>With an effort I forced myself to concentrate on the playing board. My
start, I decided, must be orthodox. I had to learn something of the type of
game this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; Yondtl&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;played. I
moved the first row right hand pukt its two oblique and one left squares.</p>

<p>Yondtl inclined his head slightly. His lips moved. Trobt put his hand to a
pukt and pushed it forward. Evidently Trobt read his lips. Very probably Yondtl
could read ours also.</p>

<p>We played for almost an hour with neither of us losing a man.</p>

<p>I had tried several gambits; gambits that invited a misplay on Yondtl's
part. But he made none. When he offered I was careful to make no mistakes of my
own. We both played as though this first game were the whole contest.</p>

<p>Another hour went by. I deliberately traded three pukts with Yondtl, in an
attempt to trick him into a misplay. None came.</p>

<p>I tried a single decoy gambit, and when nothing happened, followed with a
second decoy. Yondtl countered each play. I marveled that he gave so little of
his attention to the board. Always he seemed to be watching me. I played. He
played. He watched me.</p>

<p>I sweated.</p>

<p>Yondtl set up an overt side pass that forced me to draw my pukts back into
the main body. Somehow I received the impression that be was teasing me. It
made me want to beat him down.</p>

<p>I decided on a crossed-force, double decoy gambit. I had never seen it employed.
Because, I suspect, it is too involved, and open to error by its user. Slowly
and painstakingly I set it up and pressed forward.</p>

<p>The Caliban in the seat opposite me never paused. He matched me play for
play. And though Yondtl's features had long since lost the power of expression,
his pale eyes seemed to develop a blue luster. I realized, almost with a shock
of surprise, that the fat monstrosity was happy—intensely happy.</p>

<p>I came out of my brief reverie with a start. Yondtl had made an obvious
play. I had made an obvious counter. I was startled to hear him sound a cry
somewhere between a muffled shout and an idiot's laugh, and my attention jerked
back to the board. I had lost the game!</p>

<p>My brief moment of abstraction had given Yondtl the opportunity to make a
pass too subtle to be detected with part of my faculties occupied elsewhere.</p>

<p>I pushed back my chair. &quot;I've had enough for tonight,&quot; I told
Trobt. If I were to do the Humans a service, I would need rest before trying
Yondtl in the second game.</p>

<p>We made arrangements to meet again the following evening, and let ourselves
out. The old woman was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>The following evening when we began play I was prepared to give my best. I
was rested and eager. And I had a concrete plan. Playing the way I had been
doing I would never beat Yondtl, I'd decided after long thought. A stand-off
was the best I could hope for. Therefore the time had come for more consummate
action. I would engage him in a triple decoy gambit!</p>

<p>I had no illusion that I could handle it—the way it should be handled. I
doubt that any man, Human or Veldian, could. But at least I would play it with
the greatest skill I had, giving my best to every move, and push the game up
the scale of reason and involution—up and up—until either Yondtl or I became
lost in its innumerable complexities, and fell.</p>

<p>As I attacked, the complexes and complications would grow gradually more
numerous, become more and more difficult, until they embraced a span greater
than one of us had the capacity to encompass, and the other would win.</p>

<p>The Game began and I forced it into the pattern I had planned. Each play,
and each maneuver, became all important, and demanding of the greatest skill I
could command. Each pulled at the core of my brain, dragging out the last iota
of sentient stuff that writhed there. Yondtl stayed with me, complex gambit
through complex gambit.</p>

<p>When the strain became too great I forced my mind to pause, to rest, and to
be ready for the next clash. At the first break I searched the annotator. It
was working steadily, with an almost smooth throb of efficiency, keeping the
position of each pukt—and its value—strong in the forefront of visualization.
But something was missing!</p>

<p>A minute went by before I spotted the fault. The move of each pukt involved
so many possibilities, so many avenues of choice, that no exact answer was
predictable on any one. The number and variation of gambits open on every play,
each subject to the multitude of Yondtl's counter moves, stretched the
possibilities beyond prediction. The annotator was a harmonizing, perceptive
force, but not a creative, initiating one. It operated in a statistical manner,
similar to a computer, and could not perform effectively where a crucial factor
or factors were unknown, or concealed, as they were here.</p>

<p>My greatest asset was negated.</p>

<p>At the end of the third hour I began to feel a steady pain in my temples, as
though a tight metal band pressed against my forehead and squeezed it inward.
The only reaction I could discern in Yondtl was that the blue glint in his eyes
had become brighter. All his happiness seemed gathered there.</p>

<p>Soon my pauses became more frequent. Great waves of brain weariness had to
be allowed to subside before I could play again.</p>

<p>And at last it came.</p>

<p>Suddenly, unexpectedly, Yondtl threw a pukt across the board and took my
second decoy—and there was no way for me to retaliate! Worse, my entire defense
was smashed.</p>

<p>I felt a kind of calm dismay. My shoulders sagged and I pushed the board
away from me and slumped in my chair.</p>

<p>I was beaten.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>The next day I escaped from Trobt. It was not difficult. I simply walked
away.</p>

<p>For three days I followed the wall of The City, looking for a way out. Each
gate was guarded. I watched unobserved and saw that a permit was necessary when
leaving. If I found no other way I would make a run for it. The time of
decision never came.</p>

<p>Meanwhile to obtain food I was forced into some contact with The City's
people, and learned to know them better. Adding this new knowledge to the old I
decided that I liked them.</p>

<p>Their manners and organization—within the framework of their culture—was as
simple and effective as their architecture. There was a strong emphasis on
pride, on strength and honor, on skill, and on living a dangerous life with a
gambler's self-command, on rectitude, on truth, and the unbreakable bond of
loyalty among family and friends. Lying, theft, and deceit were practically
unknown.</p>

<p>I did detect what might have been a universal discontent in their young men.
They had a warrior heritage and nature which, with the unity of the tribes and
the passing of the dleeth—and no one to fight except themselves—had left them
with an unrecognized futility of purpose. They had not quite been able to
achieve a successful sublimation of their post-warrior need to fight in the
Games. Also, the custom of polygamy—necessary in the old days, and desired
still by those able to attain it—left many sexually frustrated.</p>

<p>I weighed all these observations in my reactions to the Veldians, and toward
the end a strange feeling—a kind of wistfulness—came as I observed. I felt kin
to them, as if these people had much in common with myself. And I felt that it
was too bad that life was not fundamentally so simple that one could discard
the awareness of other ways of life, of other values and philosophies that bid
against one another, and against one's attention, and make him cynical of the
philosophy he lives by, and dies for. Too bad that I could not see and take
life as that direct, and as that simple.</p>

<p>The third day I climbed a spiral ramp to the top of a tower that rose above
the walls of Hearth and gazed out over miles of swirling red sand. Directly
beneath me stretched a long concrete ribbon of road. On the road were dozens of
slowly crawling vehicles that might have been caterpillar trucks of Earth!</p>

<p>In my mind the pattern clicked into place. Hearth was not typical of the
cities of Velda!</p>

<p>It was an anachronism, a revered Homeplace, a symbol of their past,
untainted by the technocracy that was pursued elsewhere. This was the capital
city, from which the heads of the government still ruled, perhaps for
sentimental reasons, but it was not typical.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>My stay in Hearth was cut short when I descended from the tower and found
Trobt waiting for me.</p>

<p>As I might have expected, he showed no sign of anger with me for having fled
into The City. His was the universal Veldian viewpoint. To them all life was
the Game. With the difference that it was played on an infinitely larger board.
Every man, and every woman, with whom the player had contact, direct or
indirect, were pukts on the Board. The player made his decisions, and his
plays, and how well he made them determined whether he won or lost. His every
move, his every joining of strength with those who could help him, his every
maneuver against those who would oppose him, was his choice to make, and he
rose or fell on the wisdom of the choice. Game, in Velda, means Duel, means
struggle and the test of man against the opponent, Life. I had made my escape
as the best play as I saw it. Trobt had no recriminations.</p>

<p>The evening of the next day Trobt woke me. Something in his constrained
manner brought me to my feet. &quot;Not what you think,&quot; he said,
&quot;but we must question you again. We will try our own methods this
time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Torture?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will die under the torture, of course. But for the questioning it
will not be necessary. You will talk.&quot;</p>

<p>The secret of their method was very simple. Silence. I was led to a room
within a room within a room. Each with very thick walls. And left alone. Here
time meant nothing.</p>

<p>Gradually I passed from boredom to restlessness, to anxiety, briefly through
fear, to enervating frustration, and finally to stark apathy.</p>

<p>When Trobt and his three accompanying guardsmen led me into the blinding
daylight I talked without hesitation or consideration of consequences.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you find any weakness in the Veldians?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>I noted then a strange thing. It was the annotator—the thing in my brain
that was a part of me, and yet apart from me—that had spoken. It was not
concerned with matters of emotion; with sentiments of patriotism, loyalty,
honor, and self-respect. It was interested only in my—and its own—survival. Its
logic told it that unless I gave the answers my questioner wanted I would die.
That, it intended to prevent.</p>

<p>I made one last desperate effort to stop that other part of my mind from
assuming control—and sank lower into my mental impotence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>&quot;What is our weakness?&quot;</p>

<p><i>&quot;Your society is doomed.&quot; </i>With the answer I realized that
the annotator had arrived at another of its conclusions.</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There are many reasons.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Give one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your culture is based on a need for struggle, for combat. When there
is no one to fight it must fall.&quot;</p>

<p>Trobt was dealing with a familiar culture now. He knew the questions to ask.</p>

<p>&quot;Explain that last statement.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your culture is based on its impetuous need to
battle&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it is armed and set against dangers and the
expectation of danger&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;fostering the pride of courage
under stress. There is no danger now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;nothing to
fight, no place to spend your over-aggressiveness, except against each other in
personal duels. Already your decline is about to enter the bloody circus and
religion stage, already crumbling in the heart while expanding at the outside.
And this is your first civilization&nbsp;. . . like a boy's first
love&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;you have no experience of a fall in your history
before to have recourse to—no cushioning of philosophy to accept
it.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For a time Trobt maintained a puzzled silence. I wondered if he had the
depth of understanding to accept the truth and significance of what he had
heard. &quot;Is there no solution?&quot; he asked at last.</p>

<p>&quot;Only a temporary one.&quot; Now it was coming.</p>

<p>&quot;Explain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;War with the Ten Thousand Worlds.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Explain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your willingness to hazard, and eagerness to battle is no weakness
when you are armed with superior weapons, and are fighting against an opponent
as disorganized, and as incapable of effective organization as the Ten Thousand
Worlds, against your long-range weapons and subtle traps.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why do you say the solution is only temporary?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You cannot win the war. You will seem to win, but it will be an
illusion. You will win the battles, kill billions, rape Worlds, take slaves,
and destroy ships and weapons. But after that you will be forced to hold the
subjection. Your numbers will not be expendable. You will be spread thin,
exposed to other cultures that will influence you, change you. You will lose
skirmishes, and in the end you will be forced back. Then will come a loss of
old ethics, corruption and opportunism will replace your honor and you will
know unspeakable shame and dishonor&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;your culture will
soon be weltering back into a barbarism and disorganization which in its
corruption and despair will be nothing like the proud tribal primitive life of
its first barbarism. You will be aware of the difference and unable to
return.&quot;</p>

<p>I understood Trobt's perplexity as I finished. He could not accept what I
told him because to him winning was only a matter of a military victory, a
victory of strength; Velda had never experienced defeat as a weakness from
within. My words made him uneasy, but he did not understand. He shrugged.
&quot;Do we have any other weakness?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Your women.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Explain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They are 'set' for the period when they greatly outnumbered their men.
Your compatible ratio is eight women to one man. Yet now it is one to one.
Further, you produce too few children. Your manpower must ever be in small
supply. Worse, your shortage of women sponsors a covert despair and sadism in
your young men&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a hunger and starvation to follow
instinct, to win women by courage and conquest and battle against
danger&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that only a war can restrain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The solution?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Beat the Federation. Be in a position to have free access to their
women.&quot;</p>

<p>Came the final ignominy. &quot;Do you have a means of reporting back to the
Ten Thousand Worlds?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Buried somewhere inside me is a nerve-twitch tape. Flesh pockets
of chemicals are stored there also. When my body temperature drops fifteen
degrees below normal the chemicals will be activated and will use the tissues
of my body for fuel and generate sufficient energy to transmit the information
on the tape back to the Ten Thousand Worlds.&quot;</p>

<p>That was enough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>&quot;Do you still intend to kill me?&quot; I asked Trobt the next day as we
walked in his garden.</p>

<p>&quot;Do not fear,&quot; he answered. &quot;You will not be cheated of an
honorable death. All Velda is as eager for it as you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; I asked. &quot;Do they see me as a madman?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They see you as you are. They cannot conceive of one man challenging a
planet, except to win himself a bright and gory death on a page of history, the
first man to deliberately strike and die in the coming war—not an impersonal
clash of battleships, but a <i>man </i>declaring personal battle against men.
We would not deprive you of that death. Our admiration is too great. We want
the symbolism of your blood now just as greatly as you want it yourself. Every
citizen is waiting to watch you die—gloriously.&quot;</p>

<p>I realized now that all the while he had interpreted my presence here in
this fantastic way. And I suspected that I had no arguments to convince him
differently.</p>

<p>Trobt had hinted that I would die under torture. I thought of the old
histories of Earth that I had read. Of the warrior race of North American
Indians. A captured enemy must die. But if he had been an honorable enemy he
was given an honorable death. He was allowed to die under the stress most
familiar to them. Their strongest ethic was a cover-up for the defeated, the
universal expressionless suppressal of reaction in conquering or watching
conquest, so as not to shame the defeated. Public torture—with the women, as
well as warriors, watching—the chance to exhibit fortitude, all the way to the
breaking point, and beyond. That was considered the honorable death, while it
was a shameful trick to quietly slit a man's throat in his sleep without giving
him a chance to fight—to show his scorn of flinching under the torture.</p>

<p>Here I was the Honorable Enemy who had exhibited courage. They would honor
me, and satisfy their hunger for an Enemy, by giving me the breaking point
test.</p>

<p>But I had no intention of dying!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>&quot;You will not kill me,&quot; I addressed Trobt. &quot;And there will be
no war.&quot;</p>

<p>He looked at me as though I had spoken gibberish.</p>

<p>My next words, I knew, would shock him. &quot;I'm going to recommend
unconditional surrender,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>Trobt's head which he had turned away swiveled sharply back to me. His mouth
opened and he made several motions to speak before succeeding. &quot;Are you
serious?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very,&quot; I answered.</p>

<p>Trobt's face grew gaunt and the skin pressed tight against his
cheekbones—almost as though he were making the surrender rather than I.
&quot;Is this decision dictated by your logic,&quot; he asked dryly, &quot;or
by faintness of heart?&quot;</p>

<p>I did not honor the question enough to answer.</p>

<p>Neither did he apologize. &quot;You understand that unconditional surrender
is the only kind we will accept?&quot;</p>

<p>I nodded wearily.</p>

<p>&quot;Will they agree to your recommendation?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; I answered. &quot;Humans are not cowards, and they will fight—as
long as there is any slightest hope of success. I will not be able to convince
them that their defeat is inevitable. But I can prepare them for what is to
come. I hope to shorten the conflict immeasurably.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can do nothing but accept,&quot; Trobt said after a moment of
thought. &quot;I will arrange transportation back to Earth for you
tomorrow.&quot; He paused and regarded me with expressionless eyes. &quot;You
realize that an enemy who surrenders without a struggle is beneath
contempt?&quot;</p>

<p>The blood crept slowly into my cheeks. It was difficult to ignore his taunt.
&quot;Will you give me six months before you move against us?&quot; I asked.
&quot;The Federation is large. I will need time to bring my message to
all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have your six months.&quot; Trobt was still not through with me,
personally. &quot;On the exact day that period ends I will expect your return
to Velda. We will see if you have any honor left.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will be back,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>During the next six months I spread my word throughout the Ten Thousand
Worlds. I met disbelief everywhere. I had not expected otherwise. The last day
I returned to Velda.</p>

<p>Two days later Velda's Council acted. They were going to give the Humans no
more time to organize counteraction. I went in the same spaceship that carried
Trobt. I intended to give him any advice he needed about the Worlds. I asked
only that his first stop be at the Jason's Fleece fringe.</p>

<p>Beside us sailed a mighty armada of warships, spaced in a long line that
would encompass the entire portion of the galaxy occupied by the Ten Thousand
Worlds. For an hour we moved ponderously forward, then the stars about us
winked out for an instant. The next moment a group of Worlds became visible on
the ship's vision screen. I recognized them as Jason's Fleece.</p>

<p>One World expanded until it appeared the size of a baseball.
&quot;Quagman,&quot; Trobt said.</p>

<p>Quagman, the trouble spot of the Ten Thousand Worlds. Dominated by an
unscrupulous clique that ruled by vendetta, it had been the source of much
trouble and vexation to the other Worlds. Its leaders were considered little
better than brigands. They had received me with much apparent courtesy. In the
end they had even agreed to surrender to the Veldians—when and if they
appeared. I had accepted their easy concurrence with askance, but they were my
main hope. </p>

<p>Two Veldians left our ship in a scooter. We waited ten long, tense hours.
When word finally came back it was from the Quagmans themselves. The Veldian
envoys were being held captive. They would be released upon the delivery of two
billion dollars—in the currency of any recognized World—and the promise of
immunity.</p>

<p>The fools!</p>

<p>Trobt's face remained impassive as he received the message.</p>

<p>We waited several more hours. Both Trobt and I watched the green mottled
baseball on the vision screen. It was Trobt who first pointed out a small,
barely discernible, black spot on the upper lefthand corner of Quagman.</p>

<p>As the hours passed, and the black spot swung slowly to the right as the
planet revolved, it grew almost imperceptibly larger. When it disappeared over
the edge of the world we slept.</p>

<p>In the morning the spot appeared again, and now it covered half the face of
the planet. Another ten hours and the entire planet became a blackened cinder.</p>

<p>Quagman was dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>The ship moved next to Mican.</p>

<p>Mican was a sparsely populated prison planet. Criminals were usually sent to
newly discovered Worlds on the edge of the Human expansion circle, and allowed
to make their own adjustments toward achieving a stable government. Men with
the restless natures that made them criminals on their own highly civilized
Worlds, made the best pioneers. However, it always took them several
generations to work their way up from anarchy to a co-operative government.
Mican had not yet had that time. I had done my best in the week I spent with
them to convince them to organize, and to be prepared to accept any terms the
Veldians might offer. The gesture, I feared, was useless but I had given all
the arguments I knew. </p>

<p>A second scooter left with two Veldian representatives. When it returned
Trobt left the control room to speak with them.</p>

<p>He returned, and shook his head. I knew it was useless to argue.</p>

<p>Mican died.</p>

<p>At my request Trobt agreed to give the remaining Jason's Fleece Worlds a
week to consider—on the condition that they made no offensive forays. I wanted
them to have time to fully assess what had happened to the other two Worlds—to
realize that that same stubbornness would result in the same disaster for them.</p>

<p>At the end of the third twenty-four-hour period the Jason's Fleece Worlds
surrendered—unconditionally. They had tasted blood; and recognized futility
when faced with it.<b> </b>That had been the best I had been able to hope for,
earlier.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>Each sector held off surrendering until the one immediately ahead had given
in. But the capitulation was complete at the finish. No more blood had had to
be shed.</p>

<p>The Veldians' terms left the Worlds definitely subservient, but they were
neither unnecessarily harsh, nor humiliating. Velda demanded specific
limitations on Weapons and war-making potentials; the obligation of reporting
all technological and scientific progress; and colonial expansion only by prior
consent.</p>

<p>There was little actual occupation of the Federation Worlds, but the
Veldians retained the right to inspect any and all functions of the various
governments. Other aspects of social and economic methods would be subject only
to occasional checks and investigation. Projects considered questionable would
be supervised by the Veldians at their own discretion.</p>

<p>The one provision that caused any vigorous protest from the Worlds was the
Veldian demand for Human women. But even this was a purely emotional reaction,
and died as soon as it was more fully understood. The Veldians were not
barbarians. They used no coercion to obtain our women. They only demanded the
same right to woo them as the citizens of the Worlds had. No woman would be
taken without her free choice. There could be no valid protest to that.</p>

<p>In practice it worked quite well. On nearly all the Worlds there were more women
than men, so that few men had to go without mates because of the Veldians'
inroads. And—by Human standards—they seldom took our most desirable women.
Because the acquiring of weight was corollary with the Veldian women becoming
sexually attractive, their men had an almost universal preference for fleshy
women. As a result many of our women who would have had difficulty securing
Human husbands found themselves much in demand as mates of the Veldians.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>Seven years passed after the Worlds' surrender before I saw Kalin Trobt
again.</p>

<p>The pact between the Veldians and the Worlds had worked out well, for both
sides. The demands of the Veldians involved little sacrifice by the Federation,
and the necessity of reporting to a superior authority made for less wrangling
and jockeying for advantageous position among the Worlds themselves.</p>

<p>The fact that the Veldians had taken more than twenty million of our
women—it was the custom for each Veldian male to take a human woman for one
mate—caused little dislocation or discontent. The number each lost did less
than balance the ratio of the sexes.</p>

<p>For the Veldians the pact solved the warrior-set frustrations, and the
unrest and sexual starvation of their males. Those men who demanded action and
adventure were given supervisory posts on the Worlds as an outlet for their
drives. All could now obtain mates; mates whose biological make-up did not
necessitate an eight to one ratio.</p>

<p>Each year it was easier for the Humans to understand the Veldians and to
meet them on common grounds socially. Their natures became less rigid, and they
laughed more—even at themselves, when the occasion demanded. </p>

<p>This was especially noticeable among the younger Veldians, just reaching an
adult status. In later years when the majority of them would have a mixture of
human blood, the difference between us would become even less pronounced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>* * *</p>

<p>Trobt had changed little during those seven years. His hair had grayed some
at the temples, and his movements were a bit less supple, but he looked well.
Much of the intensity had left his aquiline features, and he seemed content.</p>

<p>We shook hands with very real pleasure. I led him to chairs under the shade
of a tree in my front yard and brought drinks.</p>

<p>&quot;First, I want to apologize for having thought you a coward,&quot; he
began, after the first conventional pleasantries. &quot;I know now I was very
wrong. I did not realize for years, however, just what had happened.&quot; He
gave his wry smile. &quot;You know what I mean, I presume?&quot;</p>

<p>I looked at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>&quot;There was more to your decision to capitulate than was revealed. When
you played the Game your forte was finding the weakness of an opponent. And
winning the second game. You made no attempt to win the first. I see now, that
as on the boards, your surrender represented only the conclusion of the first
game. You were keeping our weakness to yourself, convinced that there would be
a second game. And that your Ten Thousand Worlds would win it.<b> </b>As you
have.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What would you say your weakness was?&quot; By now I suspected he knew
everything, but I wanted to be certain.</p>

<p>&quot;Our desire and need for Human women, of course.&quot;</p>

<p>There was no need to dissemble further. &quot;The solution first came to
me,&quot; I explained, &quot;when I remembered a formerly independent Earth
country named China. They lost most of their wars, but in the end they always
won.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Through their women?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indirectly. Actually it was done by absorbing their conquerors. The
situation was similar between Velda and the Ten Thousand Worlds. Velda won the
war, but in a thousand years there will be no Veldians—racially.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That was my first realization,&quot; Trobt said. &quot;I saw immediately
then how you had us hopelessly trapped. The marriage of our men to your women
will blend our bloods until—with your vastly greater numbers—in a dozen
generations there will be only traces of our race left.</p>

<p>&quot;And what can we do about it?&quot; Trobt continued. &quot;We can't
kill our beloved wives—and our children. We can't stop further acquisition of
Human women without disrupting our society. Each generation the tie between us
will become closer, our blood thinner, yours more dominant, as the intermingling
continues. We cannot even declare war against the people who are doing this to
us. How do you fight an enemy that has surrendered unconditionally?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You do understand that for your side this was the only solution to the
imminent chaos that faced you?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; I watched Trobt's swift mind go through its reasoning. I
was certain he saw that Velda was losing only an arbitrary distinction of race,
very much like the absorbing of the early clans of Velda into the family of the
Danlee. Their dislike of that was very definitely only an emotional
consideration. The blending of our bloods would benefit both; the resultant new
race would be better and stronger because of that blending.</p>

<p>With a small smile Trobt raised his glass. &quot;We will drink to the union
of two great races,&quot; he said. &quot;And to you—the winner of the Second
Game!&quot;</p>
