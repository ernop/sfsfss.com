  <title>Egan, Greg - Luminous</title>


</head>



<body>

<h1>Luminous</h1>

<h2>Greg Egan</h2>

<p></p>

<p>I woke disoriented, unsure why. I knew I was Iying on the
narrow, lumpy single bed in Room 22 of the Hotel Fleapit; after almost
a month in Shanghai, the topography of the mattress was depressingly
familiar. But there was something wrong with the way I was Iying; every
muscle in my neck and shoulders was protesting that nobody could end up
in this position from natural causes, however badly they&rsquo;d
slept.</p>

<p>And I could smell blood.</p>

<p>I opened my eyes. A woman I&rsquo;d never seen before was
kneeling over me, slicing into my left tricep with a disposable
scalpel. I was lying on my side, facing the wall, one hand and one
ankle cuffed to the head and foot of the bed.</p>

<p>Something cut short the surge of visceral panic before I could
start stupidly thrashing about, instinctively trying to break free.
Maybe an even more ancient response-catatonia in the face of
danger-took on the adrenaline and won. Or maybe I just decided that I
had no right to panic when I&rsquo;d been expecting something like
this for weeks.</p>

<p>I spoke softly, in English. &ldquo;What you&rsquo;re
in the process of hacking out of me is a necrotrap. One heartbeat
without oxygenated blood, and the cargo gets fried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My amateur surgeon was compact, muscular, with short black
hair. Not Chinese: Indonesian, maybe. If she was surprised that
I&rsquo;d woken prematurely, she didn&rsquo;t show it. The
gene-tailored hepatocytes I&rsquo;d acquired in Hanoi could degrade
almost anything from morphine to curare; it was a good thing the local
anaesthetic was beyond their reach.</p>

<p>Without taking her eyes off her work, she said,
&ldquo;Look on the table next to the bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I twisted my head around. She&rsquo;d set up a loop of
plastic tubing full of blood-mine, presumably-circulated and aerated by
a small pump. The stem of a large funnel fed into the loop, the
intersection controlled by a valve of some kind. Wires trailed from the
pump to a sensor taped to the inside of my elbow, synchronizing the
artificial pulse with the real. I had no doubt that she could tear the
trap from my vein and insert it into this substitute without missing a
beat.</p>

<p>I cleared my throat and swallowed. &ldquo;Not good enough.
The trap knows my blood pressure profile exactly. A generic heartbeat
won&rsquo;t fool it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re bluffing .&rdquo; But she
hesitated, scalpel raised. The hand-held MRI scanner she&rsquo;d
used to find the trap would have revealed its basic configuration, but
few fine details of the engineering-and nothing at all about the
software.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you the truth.&rdquo; I
looked her squarely in the eye, which wasn&rsquo;t easy given our
awkward geometry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s new, it&rsquo;s
Swedish. You anchor it in a vein forty-eight hours in advance, put
yourself through a range of typical activities so it can memorize the
rhythms&hellip; then you inject the cargo into the trap. Simple,
foolproof, effective.&rdquo; Blood trickled down across my chest
onto the sheet. I was suddenly very glad that I hadn&rsquo;t buried
the thing deeper, after all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So how do you retrieve the cargo,
yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be telling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then tell me now, and save yourself some
trouble.&rdquo; She rotated the scalpel between thumb and
forefinger impatiently. My skin did a cold burn all over, nerve ends
jangling, capillaries closing down as blood dived for cover.</p>

<p>I said, &ldquo;Trouble gives me hypertension.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled down at me thinly, conceding the stalemate-then
peeled off one stained surgical glove, took out her notepad, and made a
call to a medical equipment supplier. She listed some devices which
would get around the problem-a blood pressure probe, a more
sophisticated pump, a suitable computerized interface-arguing heatedly
in fluent Mandarin to extract a promise of a speedy delivery. Then she
put down the notepad and placed her ungloved hand on my shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can relax now. We won&rsquo;t have long to
wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I squirmed, as if angrily shrugging off her hand-and succeeded
in getting some blood on her skin. She didn&rsquo;t say a word, but
she must have realized at once how careless she&rsquo;d been; she
climbed off the bed and headed for the washbasin, and I heard the water
running.</p>

<p>Then she started retching.</p>

<p>I called out cheerfulIy, &ldquo;Let me know when
you&rsquo;re ready for the
antidote.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; l</p>

<p>I heard her approach, and I turned to face her. She was ashen,
her face contorted with nausea, eyes and nose streaming mucus and tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me where it is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncuff me, and I&rsquo;ll get it for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! No deals!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine. Then you&rsquo;d better start looking,
yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She picked up the scalpel and brandished it in my face.
&ldquo;Screw the cargo. I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; She was
shivering like a feverish child, uselessly trying ~ to stem the flood
from her nostrils with the back of her hand. ~ I</p>

<p>I said coldly, &ldquo;If you cut me again,
you&rsquo;ll lose more than the cargo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned away and vomited; it was thin and gray,
blood-streaked. The toxin was persuading cells in her stomach lining to
commit suicide en masse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncuff me. It&rsquo;ll kill you. It
doesn&rsquo;t take long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She wiped her mouth, steeled herself, made as if to speak-then
started puking again. I knew, first hand, exactly how bad she was
feeling. Keeping it down was like trying to swallow a mixture of shit
and sulphuric acid. Bringing it up was like evisceration.</p>

<p>I said, &ldquo;In thirty seconds, you&rsquo;ll be too
weak to help yourself-even if I told you where to look. So if
I&rsquo;m not free&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She produced a gun and a set of keys, uncuffed me, then stood
by the foot of the bed, shaking badly but keeping me targeted. I
dresses quickly, ignoring her threats, bandaging my arm with a
miraculously clean spare sock before putting on a T-shirt and a jacket.
She sagged to her knees, still aiming the gun more or less in my
direction-but her eyes were swollen half-shut brimming with yellow
fluid. I thought about trying to disarm her, but it didn&rsquo;t
seem worth the risk.</p>

<p>I packed my remaining clothes, then glanced around the room as
if I might have left something behind. But everything that really
mattered was in my veins; Alison had taught me that that was the only
way to travel.</p>

<p>I turned to the burglar. &ldquo;There is no antidote. But
the toxin won&rsquo;t kill you. You&rsquo;ll just wish it
would, for the next twelve hours. Goodbye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I headed for the door, hairs rose suddenly on the back of
my neck. It occurred to me that she might not take me at my word-and
might fire a par ting shot, believing she had nothing to lose.</p>

<p>Turning the handle, without looking back, I said,
&ldquo;But if you come after me-next time, Ill kill you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was a lie, but it seemed to do the trick. As I pulled the
door shut behind me, I heard her drop the gun and start vomiting again.</p>

<p>Halfway down the stairs, the euphoria of escape began to give
way to a bleaker perspective. If one careless bounty hunter could find
me, her more methodical colleagues couldn&rsquo;t be far behind.
Industrial Algebra was closing in on us. If Alison didn&rsquo;t
gain access to Luminous soon, we&rsquo;d have no choice but to
destroy the map. And even that would only be buying time.</p>

<p>I paid the desk clerk for the room until the next morning,
stressing that my companion should not be disturbed, and added a
suitable tip to compensate for the mess the cleaners would find. The
toxin denatured in air; the bloodstains would be harmless in a matter
of hours. The clerk eyed me suspiciously, but said nothing.</p>

<p>Outside, it was a mild, cloudless summer morning. It was
barely six o&rsquo;clock, but Kongjiang Lu was already crowded with
pedestrians, cyclists buses-and a few ostentatious chauffeured
limousines, ploughing through the traffic at about ten kph. It looked
like the night shift had just emerged from the Intel factory down the
road; most of the passing cyclists were wearing the orange,
logo-emblazoned overalls.</p>

<p>Two blocks from the hotel I stopped dead, my legs almost
giving way beneath me. It wasn&rsquo;t just shock-a delayed
reaction, a belated acceptance of how close I&rsquo;d come to being
slaughtered; The burglar&rsquo;s clinical violence was chilling
enough-but what it implied was infinitely more disturbing.</p>

<p>Industrial Algebra was paying big money, violating
international law, taking serious risks with their corporate and
personal futures. The arcane abstraction of the defect was being
dragged into the world of blood and dust, boardrooms and assassins,
power and pragmatism.</p>

<p>And the closest thing to certainty humanity had ever known was
in danger of dissolving into quicksand.</p>

<p>It had all started out as a joke. Argument for
argument&rsquo;s sake. Alison and her infuriating heresies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A mathematical theorem,&rdquo; she&rsquo;d
proclaimed, &ldquo;only becomes true when a physical system tests
it out: when the system&rsquo;s behavior depends in some way on the
theorem being true or false.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was June 1994. We were sitting in a small paved courtyard,
having just emerged yawning and blinking into the winter sunlight from
the final lecture in a one-semester course on the philosophy of
mathematics-a bit of-light relief from the hard grind of the real
stuff. We had fifteen minutes to kill before meeting some friends for
lunch. It was a social conversation-verging on mild flirtation-nothing
more. Maybe there were demented academics lurking in dark crypts
somewhere, who held views on the nature of mathematical that they were
willing to die for. But we were twenty years old, and we knew it was
all angels on the head of a pin.</p>

<p>I said, &ldquo;Physical systems don&rsquo;t create
mathematics. Nothing creates mathematics-it&rsquo;s timeless. All
of number theory would still be exactly the same, even if the universe
contained nothing but a single electron.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alison snorted. &ldquo;Yes, because even one electron,
plus a space-time to put it in, needs all of quantum mechanics and all
of general relativity-and all the mathematical infrastructure they
entail. One particle floating in a quantum vacuum needs half the major
results of group theory, functional analysis, differential
geometry-&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, okay! I get the point. But if
that&rsquo;s the case&hellip; the events in the first
picosecond after the Big Bang would have
&lsquo;constructed&rsquo; every last mathematical truth
required by any physical system, all the way to the Big Crunch. Once
you&rsquo;ve got the mathematics that underpins the Theory of
Everything&hellip; that&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s all you
ever need. End of story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not. To apply the Theory of
Everything to a particular system, you still need all the mathematics
for dealing with that system-which could include results far beyond the
mathematics that the TOE itself requires. I mean, fifteen billion years
after the Big Bang, someone can still come along and prove,
say&hellip; Fermat&rsquo;s Last Theorem.&rdquo; Andrew
Wiles at Princeton had recently announced a proof of the famous
conjecture, although his work was still being scrutinized by his
colleagues, and the final verdict wasn&rsquo;t yet in.
&ldquo;Physics never needed that before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I protested, &ldquo;What do you mean,
&lsquo;before&rsquo;? Fermat&rsquo;s Last Theorem never
has-and never will-have anything to do with any branch of
physics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alison smiled sneakily. &ldquo;No branch-no. But only
because the class of physical systems whose behavior depends on it is
so ludicrously specific: the brains of mathematicians who are trying to
validate the Wiles proof.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think about it. Once you start trying to prove a
theorem, then even if the mathematics is so &lsquo;pure&rsquo;
that it has no relevance to any other object in the
universe&hellip; you&rsquo;ve just made it relevant to
yourself. You have to choose some physical process to test the
theorem-whether you use a computer, or a pen and paper&hellip; or
just close your eyes and shuffle neurotransmitters. There&rsquo;s
no such thing as a proof that doesn&rsquo;t rely on physical
events-and whether they&rsquo;re inside or outside your skull
doesn&rsquo;t make them any less real.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fair enough,&rdquo; I conceded warily.
&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t mean-&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And maybe Andrew Wiles&rsquo;s brain-and body,
and notepaper-comprised the first physical system whose behavior
depended on the theorem being true or false. But I don&rsquo;t
think human actions have any special role&hellip; and if some swarm
of quarks had done the same thing blindly, fifteen billion years
before-executed some purely random interaction that just happened to
test the conjecture in some way-then those quarks would have
constructed FLT long before Wiles. We&rsquo;ll never
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I opened my mouth to complain that no swarm of quarks could
have tested the infinite number of cases encompassed by the theorem-but
I caught myself just in time. That was true-but it hadn&rsquo;t
stopped Wiles. A finite sequence of logical steps linked the axioms of
number theory-which included some simple generalities about all
numbers-to Fermat&rsquo;s own sweeping assertion. And if a
mathematician could test those logical steps by manipulating a finite
number of physical objects for a finite amount of time-whether they
were pencil marks on paper, or neurotransmitters in his or her
brain-then all kinds of physical systems could, in theory, mimic the
structure of the proof&hellip; with or without any awareness of
what it was they were &ldquo;proving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I leant back on the bench and mimed tearing out hair.
&ldquo;If I wasn&rsquo;t a die-hard Platonist before,
you&rsquo;re forcing me into it! Fermat&rsquo;s Last Theorem
didn&rsquo;t need to be proved by anyone-or stumbled on by any
random swarm of quarks. If it&rsquo;s true, it was always true.
Everything implied by a given set of axioms is logically connected to
them, timelessly, eternally&hellip; even if the links
couldn&rsquo;t be traced by people-or quarks-in the lifetime of the
universe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alison was having none of this; every mention of timeless and
eternal truths brought a faint smile to the corner of her mouth, as if
I was affirming my belief in Santa Claus. She said, &ldquo;So who,
or what, pushed the consequences of &lsquo;There exists an entity
zero&rsquo; and &lsquo;Every X has a successor et cetera, all
the way to Fermat&rsquo;s Last Theorem and beyond, before the
universe had a chance to test out any of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I stood my ground. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s joined by logic
is just&hellip; joined. Nothing has to happen-consequences
don&rsquo;t have to be pushed&lsquo; into existence by anyone,
or anything. Or do you imagine that the first events after the Big
Bang, the first wild jitters of the quark-gluon-plasma, stopped to fill
in all the logical gaps? You think the quarks reasoned: well, so far
we&rsquo;ve done A and B and C-but now we must do D, because D
would be logically inconsistent with the other mathematics
we&rsquo;ve &rsquo;invented&lsquo; so far&hellip; even
if it would take a five-hundred-thousand-page proof to spell out the
inconsistency?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alison thought it over. &lsquo;&rsquo;No. But what if
event D took place, regardless? What if the mathematics it implied was
logically inconsistent with the rest-but it went ahead and happened
anyway&hellip; because the universe was too young to have computed
the fact that there was any discrepancy?&ldquo;</p>

<p>I must have sat and stared at her, open-mouthed, for about ten
seconds. Given the orthodoxies we&rsquo;d spent the last
two-and-a-half years absorbing, this was a seriously outrageous
statement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re claiming that&hellip;
mathematics might be strewn with primordial defects in consistency?
Like space might be strewn with cosmic strings?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; She stared back at me, feigning
nonchalance. &ldquo;If space-time doesn&rsquo;t join up with
itself smoothly, everywhere&hellip; why should mathematical
logic?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I almost choked. &ldquo;Where do I begin? What
happens-now-when some physical system tries to link theorems across the
defect? If theorem D has been rendered &lsquo;true&rsquo; by
some over-eager quarks, what happens when we program a computer to
disprove it? When the software goes through all the logical steps that
link A, B, and C-which the quarks have also made true-the dreaded
not-D&hellip; does it succeed, or doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alison sidestepped the question. &ldquo;Suppose
they&rsquo;re both true: D and not-D. Sounds like the end of
mathematics, doesn&rsquo;t it? The whole system falls apart,
instantly. From D and not-D together you can prove anything you like:
one equals zero, day equals night. But that&rsquo;s just the boring
old-fart Platonist view-where logic travels faster than light, and
computation takes no time at all. People live with omega-inconsistent
theories, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Omega-inconsistent number theories were non-standard versions
of arithmetic, based on axioms that &ldquo;almost&rdquo;
contradicted each other-their saving grace being that the
contradictions could only show up in &ldquo;infinitely long
proofs&rdquo; (which were formally disallowed, quite apart from
being physically impossible). That was perfectly respectable modern
mathematics-but Alison seemed prepared to replace &ldquo;infinitely
long&rdquo; with just plain &ldquo;long&rdquo;-as if the
difference hardly mattered, in practice.</p>

<p>I said, &ldquo;Let me get this straight. What
you&rsquo;re talking about is taking ordinary arithmetic-no weird
counter-intuitive axioms, just the stuff every ten-year-old knows is
true-and proving that it&rsquo;s inconsistent, in a finite number
of steps?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She nodded blithely. &ldquo;Finite, but large. So the
contradiction would rarely have any physical manifestation-it would be
&lsquo;computationally distant&rsquo; from everyday
calculations, and everyday physical events. I mean&hellip; one
cosmic string, somewhere out there, doesn&rsquo;t destroy the
universe, does it? It does no harm to anyone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I laughed drily. &ldquo;So long as you don&rsquo;t get
too close. So long as you don&rsquo;t tow it back to the solar
system and let it twitch around slicing up planets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I glanced at my watch. &ldquo;Time to come down to Earth,
I think. You know we&rsquo;re meeting Ju1Ia and Ramesh-?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alison sighed theatrically. &ldquo;I know, I know. And
this would bore them witless, poor things-so the subject&rsquo;s
closed, I promise.&rdquo; She added wickedly, &ldquo;Humanities
students are so myopic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We set off across the tranquil leafy campus. Alison kept her
word, and we walked in silence; carrying on the argument up to the last
minute would have made it even harder to avoid the topic once we were
in polite company.</p>

<p>Half-way to the cafeteria, though, I couldn&rsquo;t help
myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If someone ever did program a computer to follow a
chain of inferences across the defect&hellip; what do you claim
would actually happen? When the end result of all those simple,
trustworthy logical steps finally popped up on the screen-which group
of primordial quarks would win the battle? And please don&rsquo;t
tell me that the whole computer just conveniently vanishes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alison smiled, tongue-in-cheek at last. &ldquo;Get real,
Bruno. How can you expect me to answer that, when the mathematics
needed to predict the result doesn&rsquo;t even exist yet? Nothing
I could say would be true or false-until someone&rsquo;s gone ahead
and done the experiment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I spent most of the day trying to convince myself that I
wasn&rsquo;t being followed by some accomplice (or rival) of the
surgeon, who might have been lurking outside the hotel. There was
something disturbingly Kafka-esque about trying to lose a tail who
might or might not have been real: no particular face I could search
for in the crowd, just the abstract idea of a pursuer. It was too late
to think about plastic surgery to make me look Han Chinese-Alison had
raised this as a serious suggestion, back in Vietnam-but Shanghai had
over a million foreign residents, so with -care even an Anglophone of
Italian descent should have been able to vanish.</p>

<p>Whether or not I was up to the task was another matter.</p>

<p>I tried joining the ant-trails of the tourists, following the
path of least resistance from the insane crush of the Yuyuan Bazaar
(where racks bursting with ten-cent watch-PC&rsquo;s,
mood-sensitive contact lenses, and the latest karaoke vocal implants,
sat beside bamboo cages of live ducks and pigeons) to the one-time
residence of Sun Yatsen (whose personality cult was currently
undergoing a mini-series-led revival on Star TV, advertised on ten
thousand buses and ten times as many T-shirts). From the tomb of the
writer Lu Xun (&ldquo;Always think and study&hellip; visit the
general then visit the victims, see the realities of your time with
open eyes&rdquo;-no prime time for him) to the Hongkou
McDonald&rsquo;s (where they were giving away small plastic Andy
Warhol figurines, for reasons I couldn&rsquo;t fathom). I mimed
leisurely window-shopping between the shrines, but kept my body
language sufficiently unfriendly to deter even the loneliest Westerner
from attempting to strike up a conversation. If foreigners were
unremarkable in most of the city, they were positively eye-glazing
here-even to each other-and I did my best to offer no one the slightest
reason to remember me.</p>

<p>Along the way I checked for messages from Alison, but there
were none. I left five of my own, tiny abstract chalk marks on bus
shelters and park benches-all slightly different, but all saying the
same thing: CLOSE BRUSH, BUT SAFE NOW. MOVING ON.</p>

<p>By early evening, I&rsquo;d done all I could to throw off
my hypothetical shadow, so I headed for the next hotel on our agreed
but unwritten list. The last time we&rsquo;d met face-to-face, in
Hanoi, I mocked all of Alison&rsquo;s elaborate preparations. Now I
was beginning to wish that I&rsquo;d begged her to extend our
secret language to cover extreme contingencies. . FATALLY WOUNDED.
BETRAYED YOU UNDER TORTURE. REALITY DECAYING. OTHERWISE FINE.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hotel on Huaihai Zhonglu was a step up from the last one,
but not quite classy enough to refuse payment in cash. The desk clerk
made polite small-talk, and I lied as smoothly as I could about my
plans to spend a week sight seeing before heading for Beijing. The
bellperson smirked when I tipped him too much-and I sat on my bed for
five minutes afterward, wondering what significance to read into that.</p>

<p>I struggled to regain a sense of proportion. Industrial
Algebra could have bribed every single hotel employee in Shanghai to be
on the lookout for us-but that was a bit like saying that, in theory,
they could have duplicated our entire twelve-year search for defects,
and not bothered to pursue us at all. There was no question that they
wanted what we had, badly-but what could they actually do about it? Go
to a merchant bank (or the Mafia, or a Triad) for finance? That might
have worked if the cargo had been a stray kilogram of plutonium, or a
valuable gene sequence-but only a few hundred thousand people on the
planet would be capable of understanding what the defect was, even in
theory. Only a fraction of that number would believe that such a thing
could really exist&hellip; and even fewer would be both wealthy and
immoral enough to invest in the business of exploiting it.</p>

<p>The stakes appeared to be infinitely high-but that
didn&rsquo;t make the players omnipotent.</p>

<p>Not yet.</p>

<p>I changed the dressing on my arm, from sock to handkerchief,
but the incision was deeper than I&rsquo;d realized, and it was
still bleeding thinly. I left the hotel-and found exactly what I needed
in a twenty-four-hour emporium just ten minutes away. Surgical grade
tissue repair cream: a mixture of collagen-based adhesive, antiseptic,
and growth factors. The emporium wasn&rsquo;t even a
pharmaceuticals outlet-it just had aisle after aisle packed with all
kinds of unrelated odds and ends, laid out beneath the unblinking
blue-white ceiling panels. Canned food, PVC plumbing fixtures,
traditional medicines, rat contraceptives, video ROMS. It was a random
cornucopia, an almost organic diversity-as if the products had all just
grown on the shelves from whatever spores the wind had happened to blow
in.</p>

<p>I headed back to the hotel, pushing my way through the
relentless crowds, half seduced and half sickened by the odors of
cooking, dazed by the endless vista of holograms and neon in a language
I barely understood. Fifteen minutes later, reeling from the noise and
humidity, I realized that I was lost.</p>

<p>I stopped on a street corner and tried to get my bearings.
Shanghai stretched out around me, dense and lavish, sensual and
ruthless-a Darwinian economic simulation self-organized to the brink of
catastrophe. The Amazon of commerce: this city of sixteen million had
more industry of every kind, more exporters and importers, more
wholesalers and retailers, traders and re-sellers and re-cyclers and
scavengers, more billionaires and more beggars, than most nations on
the planet.</p>

<p>Not to mention more computing power.</p>

<p>China itself was reaching the cusp of its decades-long
transition from brutal totalitarian communism to brutal totalitarian
capitalism: a slow seamless morph from Mao to Pinochet set to the
enthusiastic applause of its trading partners and the international
financial agencies. There&rsquo;d been no need for a
counter-revolution just layer after layer of carefully reasoned
Newspeak to pave the way from previous doctrine to the stunningly
obvious conclusion that private property, a thriving middle class, and
a few trillion dollars worth of foreign investment were exactly what
the Party had been aiming for all along.</p>

<p>The apparatus of the police state remained as essential as
ever. Trade unionists with decadent bourgeois ideas about uncompetitive
wages, journalists With counter-revolutionary notions of exposing
corruption and nepotism, and any number of subversive political
activists spreading destabilizing propaganda about the fantasy of free
elections, all needed to be kept in check.</p>

<p>In a way, Luminous was a product of this strange transition
from communism to not-communism in a thousand tiny steps. No one else,
not even the U.S. defense research establishment, possessed a single
machine with so much power. The rest of the world had succumbed long
ago to networking, giving up their imposing supercomputers with their
difficult architecture and customized chips for a few hundred of the
latest mass-produced work stations. In fact, the biggest computing
feats of the twenty-first century had all been farmed out over the
Internet to thousands of volunteers, to run on their machines whenever
the processors would otherwise be idle. That was how Alison and I had
mapped the defect in the first place: seven thousand amateur
mathematicians had shared the joke, for twelve years.</p>

<p>But now the net was the very opposite of what we needed-and
only Luminous could take its place. And though only the
People&rsquo;s Republic could have paid for it, and only the
People&rsquo;s Institute for Advanced Optical Engineering could
have built it&hellip; only Shanghai&rsquo;s QIPS Corporation
could have sold time on it to the world-while it was still being used
to model hydrogen bomb shock waves, pilotless fighter jets, and exotic
antisatellite weapons.</p>

<p>I finally decoded the street signs, and realized what
I&rsquo;d done: I&rsquo;d turned the wrong way coming out of
the emporium, it was as simple as that.</p>

<p>I retraced my steps, and I was soon back on familiar territory.</p>

<p>When I opened the door of my room, Alison was sitting on the
bed.</p>

<p>I said, &ldquo;What is it with locks in this
city?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We embraced, briefly. We&rsquo;d been lovers, once-but
that was long over. And we&rsquo;d been friends for years
afterward-but I wasn&rsquo;t sure if that was still the right word.
Our whole relationship now was too functional, too spartan. Everything
revolved around the defect, now.</p>

<p>She said, &ldquo;I got your message. What
happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I described the morning&rsquo;s events.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know what you should have done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That stung. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still here,
aren&rsquo;t I? The cargo&rsquo;s still safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have killed her, Bruno.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I laughed. Alison gazed back at me placidly, and I looked
away. I didn&rsquo;t know if she was serious-and I didn&rsquo;t
much want to find out.</p>

<p>She helped me apply the repair cream. My toxin was no threat
to her-we&rsquo;d both installed exactly the same symbionts, the
same genotype from the same unique batch in Hanoi. But it was strange
to feel her bare fingers on my broken skin, knowing that no one else on
the planet could touch me like this, with impunity.</p>

<p>Ditto for sex, but I didn&rsquo;t want to dwell on that.</p>

<p>As I slipped on my jacket, she said, &ldquo;So guess what
we&rsquo;re doing at five A.M. tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me: I fly to Helsinki, and you
fly to Cape Town. Just to throw them off the scent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That got a faint smile. &ldquo;Wrong. We&rsquo;re
meeting Yuen at the Institute-and spending half an hour on
Luminous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are brilliant.&rdquo; I bent over and
kissed her on the forehead. &ldquo;But I always knew
you&rsquo;d pull it off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I should have been delirious-but the truth was, my guts
were churning. I felt almost as trapped as I had upon waking cuffed to
the bed. If Luminous had remained beyond our reach (as it should have,
since we couldn&rsquo;t afford to hire it for a microsecond at the
going rate) we would have had no choice but to destroy all the data,
and hope for the best. Industrial Algebra had no doubt dredged up a few
thousand fragments of the original Internet calculations-but it was
clear that, although they knew exactly what we&rsquo;d found, they
still had no idea where we&rsquo;d found it. If they&rsquo;d
been forced to start their own random search-constrained by the need
for secrecy to their own private hardware-it might have taken them
centuries.</p>

<p>There was no question now, though, of backing away and leaving
everything to chance. We were going to have to confront the defect in
person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much did you have to tell him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything.&rdquo; She walked over to the
washbasin, removed her shirt, and began wiping the sweat from her neck
and torso with a washcloth. &ldquo;Short of handing over the map. I
showed him the search algorithms and their results, and all the
programs wall need to run on Luminous-all stripped of specific
parameter values, but enough for him to validate the techniques. He
wanted to see direct evidence of the defect, of course, but I held out
on that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how much did he believe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s reserved judgment. The deal is, we
get half an hour&rsquo;s unimpeded access-but he gets to observe
everything we do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I nodded, as if my opinion made any difference, as if we had
any choice. Yuen Ting-fu had been Alison&rsquo;s supervisor for her
Ph.D. on advanced applications of ring theory, when she&rsquo;d
studied at Fu-tan University in the late nineties. Now he was one of
the world&rsquo;s leading cryptographers, working as a consultant
to the military, the security services, and a dozen international
corporations. Alison had once told me that she&rsquo;d heard
he&rsquo;d found a polynomial-time algorithm for factoring the
product of two primes; that had never been officially
confirmed&hellip; but such was the power of his reputation that
almost everyone on the planet had stopped using the old RSA encryption
method as the rumor had spread. No doubt time on Luminous was his for
the asking-but that didn&rsquo;t mean he couldn&rsquo;t still
be imprisoned for twenty years for giving it away to the wrong people,
for the wrong reasons.</p>

<p>I said, &ldquo;And you trust him? He may not believe in
the defect now, but once he&rsquo;s convinced-&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hell want exactly what we want. I&rsquo;m sure
of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay. But are you sure IA won&rsquo;t be
watching, too? If they&rsquo;ve worked out why we&rsquo;re
here, and they&rsquo;ve bribed someone-&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alison cut me off impatiently. &ldquo;There are still a
few things you can&rsquo;t buy in this city. Spying on a military
machine like Luminous would be suicidal. No one would risk
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about spying on unauthorized projects being
run on a military machine? Maybe the crimes cancel out, and you end up
a hero.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She approached me, half naked, drying her face on my towel.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better hope not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I laughed suddenly. &ldquo;You know what I like most about
Luminous? They&rsquo;re not really letting Exxon and
McDonnell-Douglas use the same machine as the People&rsquo;s
Liberation Army. Because the whole computer vanishes every time they
pull the plug. There&rsquo;s no paradox at all, if you look at it
that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alison insisted that we stand guard in shifts. Twenty-four
hours earlier, I might have made a joke of it; now I reluctantly
accepted the revolver she offered me, and sat watching the door in the
neon-tinged darkness while she went out like a light.</p>

<p>The hotel had been quiet for most of the evening-but now it
came to life. There were footsteps in the corridor every five
minutes-and rats in the walls, foraging and screwing and probably
giving birth. Police sirens wailed in the distance; a couple screamed
at each other in the street below. I&rsquo;d read somewhere that
Shanghai was now the murder capital of the world-but was that per
capita, or in absolute numbers?</p>

<p>After an hour, I was so jumpy that it was a miracle I
hadn&rsquo;t blown my foot off. I unloaded the gun, then sat
playing Russian roulette with the empty barrel. In spite of everything,
I still wasn&rsquo;t ready to put a bullet in anyone&rsquo;s
brain for the sake of defending the axioms of number theory.</p>

<p>Industrial Algebra had approached us in a perfectly civilized
fashion, at first. They were a small but aggressive UK-based company,
designing specialized high-performance computing hardware for
industrial and military applications. That they&rsquo;d heard about
the search was no great surprise-it had been openly discussed on the
Internet for years, and even joked about in serious mathematical
journals-but it seemed an odd coincidence when they made contact with
us just days after Alison had sent me a private message from
Z&Yuml;rich mentioning the latest &ldquo;promising&rdquo;
result. After half a dozen false alarms-all due to bugs and
glitches-we&rsquo;d stopped broadcasting the news of every
unconfirmed find to the people who were donating runtime to the
project, let alone any wider circle. We were afraid that if we cried
wolf one more time, half our collaborators would get so annoyed that
they&rsquo;d withdraw their support.</p>

<p>IA had offered us a generous slab of computing power on the
company&rsquo;s private network several orders of magnitude more
than we received from any other donor Why? The answer kept changing.
Their deep respect for pure mathematics&hellip; their wide-eyed
fun-loving attitude to life&hellip; their desire to be seen to be
sponsoring a project s0 wild and hip and unlikely to succeed that it
made SETI look like a staid blue-chip investment. It
was-they&rsquo;d finally &ldquo;conceded&rdquo;-a desperate
bid to soften their corporate image, after years of bad press for what
certain unsavory governments did with their really rather nice smart
bombs.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d politely declined. They&rsquo;d offered us
highly paid consulting jobs. Bemused, we&rsquo;d suspended all
net-based calculations-and started encrypting our mail with a simple
but highly effective algorithm Alison had picked up from Yuen.</p>

<p>Alison had been collating the results of the search on her own
work station at her current home in Z&Yuml;rich, while
I&rsquo;d helped coordinate things from Sydney. No doubt IA had
been eavesdropping on the incoming data, but they&rsquo;d clearly
started too late to gather the information needed to create their own
map; each fragment of the calculations meant little in isolation. But
when the work station was stolen (all the files were encrypted, it
would have told them nothing) we&rsquo;d finally been forced to ask
ourselves: If the defect turns out to be genuine, if the joke is no
joke&hellip; then exactly what&rsquo;s at stake? How much
money? How much power?</p>

<p>On June 7, 2006, we met in a sweltering, crowded square in
Hanoi. Alison wasted no time. She was carrying a backup of the data
from the stolen work station in her notepad-and she solemnly proclaimed
that, this time, the defect was real.</p>

<p>The notepad&rsquo;s tiny processor would have taken
centuries to repeat the long random trawling of the space of arithmetic
statements that had been carried out on the net-but, led straight to
the relevant computations, it could confirm the existence of the defect
in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>The process began with Statement S. Statement S was an
assertion about some ludicrously huge numbers-but it wasn&rsquo;t
mathematically sophisticated or contentious in any way. There were no
claims here about infinite sets, no propositions concerning
&ldquo;every integer.&rdquo; It merely stated that a certain
(elaborate) calculation performed on certain (very large) whole numbers
led to a certain result-in essence, it was no different from something
like &ldquo;5+3 = 4x2&rdquo;. It might have taken me ten years
to check it with a pen and paper-but I could have carried out the task
with nothing but elementary school mathematics and a great deal of
patience. A statement like this could not be undecidable; it had to be
either true or false.</p>

<p>The notepad decided it was true.</p>

<p>Then the notepad took Statement S&hellip; and in four
hundred and twenty-three simple, impeccably logical steps, used it to
prove not-S.</p>

<p>I repeated the calculations on my own notepad-using a
different software package. The result was exactly the same. I gazed at
the screen, trying to concoct a plausible reason why two different
machines running two different programs could have failed in identical
ways. There&rsquo;d certainly been cases in the past of a single
misprinted algorithm in a computing textbook spawning a thousand dud
programs. But the operations here were too simple, too basic.</p>

<p>Which left only two possibilities. Either conventional
arithmetic was intrinsically flawed, and the whole Platonic ideal of
the natural numbers was ultimately self-contradictory&hellip; or
Alison was right, and an alternative arithmetic had come to hold sway
in a &ldquo;computationally remote&rdquo; region, billions of
years ago.</p>

<p>I was badly shaken-but my first reaction was to try to play
down the significance of the result. &ldquo;The numbers being
manipulated here are greater than the volume of the observable
universe, measured in cubic Planck lengths. If IA were hoping to use
this on their foreign exchange transactions, I think they&rsquo;ve
made a slight error of scale.&rdquo; Even as I spoke, though, I
knew it wasn&rsquo;t that simple. The raw numbers might have been
trans-astronomical-but it was the mere 1024 bits of the
notepad&rsquo;s binary representations that had actually,
physically misbehaved. Every truth in mathematics was encoded,
reflected, in countless other forms. If a paradox like this-which at
first glance sounded like a dispute about numbers too large to apply
even to the most grandiose cosmological discussions-could affect the
behavior of a five-gram silicon chip, then there could easily be a
billion other systems on the planet at risk of being touched by the
very same flaw.</p>

<p>But there was worse to come.</p>

<p>The theory was, we&rsquo;d located part of the boundary
between two incompatible systems of mathematics-both of which were
physically true, in their respective domains. Any sequence of
deductions that stayed entirely on one side of the defect-whether it
was the &ldquo;near side,&rdquo; where conventional arithmetic
applied, or the &ldquo;far side,&rdquo; where the alternative
took over-would be free from contradictions. But any sequence that
crossed the border would give rise to absurdities-hence S could lead to
not-S.</p>

<p>So, by examining a large number of chains of inference, some
of which turned out to be self-contradictory and some not, it should
have been possible to map the area around the defect precisely-to
assign every statement to one system or the other.</p>

<p>Alison displayed the first map she&rsquo;d made. It
portrayed an elaborate crenulated fractal border, rather like the
boundary between two microscopic ice crystals-as if the two systems had
been diffusing out at random from different starting points, and then
collided, blocking each other&rsquo;s way. By now, I was almost
prepared to believe that I really was staring at a snapshot of the
creation of mathematics-a fossil of primordial attempts to define the
difference between truth and falsehood.</p>

<p>Then she produced a second map of the same set of statements,
and overlaid the two. The defect, the border, had shifted-advancing in
some places, retreating in others</p>

<p>My blood went cold. &ldquo;That has got to be a bug in the
software.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I inhaled deeply, looking around the square as if the heedless
crow. of tourists and hawkers, shoppers and executives, might offer
some simple &ldquo;human&rdquo; truth more resilient than mere
arithmetic. But all I could think of was 1984: Winston Smith, finally
beaten into submission, abandoning every touchstone of reason by
conceding that two and two make five.</p>

<p>I said, &ldquo;Okay. Go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the early universe, some physical system must
have tested out mathematics that was isolated, cut off from all the
established results-leaving it free to decide the outcome at random.
That&rsquo;s how the defect arose. But by now, all the mathematics
in this region has been tested, all the gaps have been filled in. When
a physical system tests theorem on the near side, not only has it been
tested a billion time before-but all the logically adjacent statements
around it have been decided, and they imply the correct result in a
single step.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean&hellip; peer pressure from the
neighbors? No inconsistencies allowed, you have to conform? If x-1 =
y-1, and x+1 = y+1, then x is left with no choice but to equal
y&hellip; because there&rsquo;s nothing
&lsquo;nearby&rsquo; to support the alternative?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly. Truth is determined locally. And
it&rsquo;s the same, deep into the far side. The alternative
mathematics has dominated there, and every test takes place surrounded
by established theorems that reinforce each other, and the
&lsquo;correct&rsquo;-non-standard-result.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the border, though-&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the border, every theorem you test is getting
contradictory advice. From one neighbor, x-1 = y-1&hellip; but from
another, x+1 = y+2. And the topology of the border is so complex that a
near-side theorem can have more far-side neighbors than near-side
ones-and vice versa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the truth at the border isn&rsquo;t fixed,
even now. Both regions can still advance or retreat-it all depends on
the order in which the theorems are tested. If a solidly near-side
theorem is tested first, and it lend support to a more vulnerable
neighbor, that can guarantee that they both stay near-side.&rdquo;
She ran a brief animation that demonstrated the effect. &ldquo;But
if the order is reversed, the weaker one will fail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I watched, light-headed. Obscure-but supposedly eternal-truth
were tumbling like chess pieces. &ldquo;And&hellip; you think
that physical processes going on right now-chance molecular events that
keep inadvertently testing and re-testing different theories along the
border-cause each side to gain and lose territory?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So there&rsquo;s been a kind of&hellip;
random tide washing back and forth between the two kinds of
mathematics, for the past few billion years?&rdquo; I laughed
uneasily, and did some rough calculations in my head. &ldquo;The
expectation value for a random walk is the square root of N. I
don&rsquo;t think we have anything to worry about. The tide
isn&rsquo;t going to wash over an, useful arithmetic in the
lifetime of the universe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alison smiled humorlessly, and held up the notepad again.
&ldquo;The tide? No. But it&rsquo;s the easiest thing in the
world to dig a channel. To bias the random flow.&rdquo; She ran an
animation of a sequence of tests that forced the far-site system to
retreat across a small front-exploiting a &ldquo;beach
head&rdquo; formed by chance, and then pushing on to undermine a
succession of theorems. &ldquo;Industrial Algebra, though-I
imagine-would be more interested in the reverse. Establishing a whole
network of narrow channels of non-standard mathematics running deep
into the realm of conventional arithmetic-which they could then deploy
against theorems with practical consequences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I fell silent, trying to imagine tendrils of contradictory
arithmetic reaching down into the everyday world. No doubt IA would aim
for surgical precision-hoping to earn themselves a few billion dollars
by corrupting the specific mathematics underlying certain financial
transactions. But the ramifications would be impossible to predict-or
control. There&rsquo;d be no way to limit the effect,
spatially-they could target certain mathematical truths, but they
couldn&rsquo;t confine the change to any one location. A few
billion dollars, a few billion neurons, a few billion stars&hellip;
a few billion people. Once the basic rules of counting were undermined,
the most solid and distinct objects could be rendered as uncertain as
swirls of fog. This was not a power I would have entrusted to a cross
between Mother Theresa and Carl Friedrich Gauss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So what do we do? Erase the map-and just hope that
IA never find the defect for themselves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Alison seemed remarkably calm-but
then, her own long-cherished philosophy had just been confirmed, not
razed to the ground-and she&rsquo;d had time on the flight from
Z&Yuml;rich to think through all the Realmathematik.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one way to be sure that they can
never use this. We have to strike first. We have to get hold of enough
computing power to map the entire defect. And then we either iron the
border flat, so it can&rsquo;t move-if you amputate all the
pincers, there can be no pincer movements. Or-better yet, if we can get
the resources-we push the border in, from all directions, and shrink
the far-side system down to nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hesitated. &ldquo;All we&rsquo;ve mapped so far is a
tiny fragment of the defect We don&rsquo;t know how large the far
side could be. Except that it can&rsquo;t be small-or the random
fluctuations-would have swallowed it long ago. And it could go on
forever; it could be infinite, for all we know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alison gave me a strange look. &ldquo;You still
don&rsquo;t get it, do you, Bruno? You&rsquo;re still thinking
like a Platonist. The universe has only been around for fifteen billion
years. It hasn&rsquo;t had time to create infinities. The far side
can&rsquo;t go on forever-because somewhere beyond the defect,
there are theorems that don&rsquo;t belong to any system. Theorems
that have never been touched, never been tested, never been rendered
true or false.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if we have to reach beyond the existing
mathematics of the universe in order to surround the far
side&hellip; then that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll do.
There&rsquo;s no reason why it shouldn&rsquo;t be possible-just
so long as we get there first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Alison took my place, at one in the morning, I was
certain I wouldn&rsquo;t get any sleep. When she shook me awake
three hours later, I still felt like I hadn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I used my notepad to send a priming code to the data caches
buried in our veins, and then we stood together side-by-side,
left-shoulder-to-right-shoulder. The two chips recognized each
other&rsquo;s magnetic and electrical signatures, interrogated each
other to be sure-and then began radiating low power microwaves.
Alison&rsquo;s notepad picked up the transmission, and merged the
two complementary data streams. The result was still heavily
encrypted-but after all the precautions we&rsquo;d taken so far,
shifting the map into a hand-held computer felt about as secure as
tattooing it onto our foreheads.</p>

<p>A taxi was waiting for us downstairs. The People&rsquo;s
Institute for Advanced Optical Engineering was in Minhang, a sprawling
technology park some thirty kilometers south of the city center. We
rode in silence through the gray predawn light, past the giant ugly
tower blocks thrown up by the landlords of the new millennium, riding
out the fever as the necrotraps and their cargo dissolved into our
blood.</p>

<p>As the taxi turned into an avenue lined with biotech and
aerospace companies, Alison said, &ldquo;If anyone asks,
we&rsquo;re Ph.D. students of Yuen&rsquo;s, testing a
conjecture in algebraic topology.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you tell me. I don&rsquo;t suppose you have
any specific conjecture in mind? What if they ask us to
elaborate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On algebraic topology? At five o&rsquo;clock in
the morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Institute building was unimposing-sprawling black ceramic,
three stories high-but there was a five-meter electrified fence, and
the entrance was guarded by two armed soldiers. We paid the taxi driver
and approached on foot. Yuen had supplied us with visitor&rsquo;s
passes-complete with photographs and fingerprints. The names were our
own; there was no point indulging in unnecessary deception. If we were
caught out, pseudonyms would only make things worse.</p>

<p>The soldiers checked the passes, then led us through an MRI
scanner. I forced myself to breathe calmly as we waited for the
results; in theory the scanner could have picked up our
symbionts&rsquo; foreign proteins, lingering breakdown products
from the necrotraps, and a dozen other suspicious trace chemicals. But
it all came down to a question of what they were looking for; magnetic
resonance spectra for billions of molecules had been catalogued-but no
machine could hunt for all of them at once.</p>

<p>One of the soldiers took me aside and asked me to remove my
jacket. I fought down a wave of panic-and then struggled not to
overcompensate: if I&rsquo;d had nothing to hide, I would still
have been nervous. He prodded the bandage on my upper arm; the
surrounding skin was still red and inflamed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a cyst there. My doctor cut it out, this
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He eyed me suspiciously, and peeled back the adhesive
bandage-with ungloved hands. I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to look;
the repair cream should have sealed the wound completely-at worst there
should have been old, dried blood-but I could feel a faint liquid
warmth along the line of the incision.</p>

<p>The soldier laughed at my gritted teeth, and waved me away
with an expression of distaste. I had no idea what he thought I might
have been hiding-but I saw fresh red droplets beading the skin before I
closed the bandage.</p>

<p>Yuen Ting-fu was waiting for us in the lobby. He was a
slender, fit looking man in his late sixties, casually dressed in
denim. I let Alison ~ do all the talking: apologizing for our lack of
punctuality (although we&rsquo;s weren&rsquo;t actually late),
and thanking him effusively for granting us this precious opportunity
to pursue our unworthy research. I stood back and tried to appear
suitably deferential. Four soldiers looked on impassively; they
didn&rsquo;t seem to find all this groveling excessive. And no
doubt I would have been giddy with awe, if I really had been a student
granted time here for some run-of-the-mill thesis.</p>

<p>We followed Yuen as he strode briskly through a second
checkpoint and scanner (this time, no one stopped us) then down a long
corridor with a soft gray vinyl floor. We passed a couple of
white-coated technicians, but they barely gave us a second glance.
I&rsquo;d had visions of a pair of obvious foreigners attracting as
much attention here as we would have wandering through a military
base-but that was absurd. Half the runtime on Luminous was sold to
foreign corporations-and because the machine was most definitely not
linked to any communications network, commercial users had to come here
in person. Just how often Yuen wangled free time for his
students-whatever their nationality-was another question, but if he
believed it was the best cover for us, I was in no position to argue. I
only hoped he&rsquo;d planted a seamless trail of reassuring lies
in the university records and beyond, in case the Institute
administration decided to check up on us in any detail.</p>

<p>We stopped in at the operations room, and Yuen chatted with
the technicians. Banks of flatscreens covered one wall, displaying
status histograms and engineering schematics. It looked like the
control center for a small particle accelerator-which wasn&rsquo;t
far from the truth.</p>

<p>Luminous was, literally, a computer made of light. It came
into existence when a vacuum chamber, a cube five meters wide, was
filled with an elaborate standing wave created by three vast arrays of
high-powered lasers. A coherent electron beam was fed into the
chamber-and just as a finely machined grating built of solid matter
could diffract a beam of light, a sufficiently ordered (and
sufficiently intense) configuration of light could diffract a beam of
matter.</p>

<p>The electrons were redirected from layer to layer of the light
cube, recombining and interfering at each stage, every change in their
phase and intensity performing an appropriate computation-and the whole
system could be reconfigured, nanosecond by nanosecond, into complex
new &ldquo;hardware&rdquo; optimized for the calculations at
hand. The auxilliary supercomputers controlling the laser arrays could
design, and then instantly build, the perfect machine of light to carry
out each particular stage of any program.</p>

<p>It was, of course, fiendishly difficult technology, incredibly
expensive and temperamental. The chance of ever putting it on the
desktops of Tetris-playing accountants was zero, so nobody in the West
had bothered to pursue it.</p>

<p>And this cumbersome, unwieldy, impractical machine ran faster
than every piece of silicon hanging off the Internet, combined.</p>

<p>We continued on to the programming room. At first glance, it
might have been the computing center in a small primary school, with
half a dozen perfectly ordinary work stations sitting on white formica
tables. They just happened to be the only six in the world that were
hooked up to Luminous.</p>

<p>We were alone with Yuen now-and Alison cut the protocol and
just glanced briefly in his direction for approval, before hurriedly
linking her notepad to one of the work stations and uploading the
encrypted map. As she typed in the instructions to decode the file, all
the images running through my head of what would have happened if
I&rsquo;d poisoned the soldier at the gate receded into
insignificance. We now had half an hour to banish the defect-and we
still had no idea how far it extended.</p>

<p>Yuen turned to me; the tension on his face betrayed his own
anxieties, but he mused philosophically, &ldquo;If our arithmetic
seems to fail for these large numbers-does it mean the mathematics, the
ideal, is really flawed and mutable-or only that the behavior of matter
always falls short of the ideal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I replied, &ldquo;If every class of physical objects
&lsquo;falls short&rsquo; in exactly the same way-whether
it&rsquo;s boulders or electrons or abacus beads&hellip; what
is it that their common behavior is obeying-or defining-if not the
mathematics?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled, puzzled. &ldquo;`Alison seemed to think you
were a Platonist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lapsed. Or&hellip; defeated. I don&rsquo;t
see what it can mean to talk about standard number theory still being
true for these statements-in some vague Platonic sense-if no real
objects can ever reflect that truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can still imagine it. We can still contemplate
the abstraction. It&rsquo;s only the physical act of validation
that must fall through. Think of transfinite arithmetic: no one can
physically test the properties of Cantor&rsquo;s infinities, can
they? We can only reason about them from afar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t reply. Since the revelations in Hanoi,
I&rsquo;d pretty much lost faith in my power to &ldquo;reason
from afar&rdquo; about anything I couldn&rsquo;t personally
describe with Arabic numerals on a single sheet of paper. Maybe
Alison&rsquo;s idea of &ldquo;local truth&rdquo; was the
most we could hope for; anything more ambitious was beginning to seem
like the comic-book &ldquo;physics&rdquo; of swinging a rigid
beam ten billion kilometers long around your head, and predicting that
the far end would exceed the speed of light.</p>

<p>An image blossomed on the work station screen: it began as the
familiar map of the defect-but Luminous was already extending it at a
mind-boggling rate. Billions of inferential loops were being spun
around the margins: some confirming their own premises, and thus
delineating regions where a single, consistent mathematics held
sway&hellip; others skewing into self-contradiction, betraying a
border crossing. I tried to imagine what it would have been like to
follow one of those Mobius-strips of deductive logic in my head; there
were no difficult concepts involved, it was only the sheer size of the
statements that made that impossible. But would the contradictions have
driven me into gibbering insanity-or would I have found every step
perfectly reasonable, and the conclusion simply unavoidable? Would I
have ended up calmly, happily conceding: Two and two make five?</p>

<p>As the map grew-smoothly re-scaled to keep it fitting on the
screen, giving the unsettling impression that we were retreating from
the alien mathematics as fast as we could, and only just avoiding being
swallowed-Alison sat hunched forward, waiting for the big picture to be
revealed. The map portrayed the network of statements as an intricate
lattice in three dimensions (a crude representational convention, but
it was as good as any other). So far, the border between the regions
showed no sign of overall curvature-just variously sized random
incursions in both directions. For all we knew, it was possible that
the far-side mathematics enclosed the near side completely-that the
arithmetic we&rsquo;d once believed stretched out to infinity was
really no more than a tiny island in an ocean of contradictory truths.</p>

<p>I glanced at Yuen; he was watching the screen with undisguised
pain. He said, &ldquo;I read your software, and I thought: sure,
this looks fine-but some glitch on your machines is the real
explanation. Luminous will soon put you right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alison broke in jubilantly, &ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s
turning!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was right. As the scale continued to shrink, the random
fractal meanderings of the border were finally being subsumed by an
overall convexity-a convexity of the far side. It was as if the
viewpoint was backing away from a giant spiked sea-urchin. Within
minutes, the map showed a crude hemisphere, decorated with elaborate
crystalline extrusions at every scale. The sense of observing some
palaeomathematical remnant was stronger than ever, now: this bizarre
cluster of theorems really did look as if it had exploded out from some
central premise into the vacuum of unclaimed truths, perhaps a
billionth of a second after the Big Bang-only to be checked by an
encounter with our own mathematics.</p>

<p>The hemisphere slowly extended into a three-quarters
sphere&hellip; and then a spiked whole. The far side was bounded,
finite. It was the island, not us.</p>

<p>Alison laughed uneasily. &ldquo;Was that true before we
started-or did we just make it true?&rdquo; Had the near side
enclosed the far side for billions of years-or had Luminous broken new
ground, actively extending the near side into mathematical territory
that had never been tested by any physical system before?</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d never know. We&rsquo;d designed the
software to advance the mapping along a front in such a way that any
unclaimed statements would be instantly recruited into the near side.
If we&rsquo;d reached out blindly, far into the void, we might have
tested an isolated statement-and inadvertently spawned a whole new
alternative mathematics to deal with.</p>

<p>Alison said, &ldquo;Okay-now we have to decide. Do we try
to seal the border-or do we take on the whole structure?&rdquo; The
software, I knew, was busy assessing the relative difficulty of the
tasks.</p>

<p>Yuen replied at once, &ldquo;Seal the border, nothing
more. You mustn&rsquo;t destroy this.&rdquo; He turned to me,
imploringly. &ldquo;Would you smash up a fossil of
Australopithecus? Would you wipe the cosmic background radiation out of
the sky? This may shake the foundations of all my beliefs-but it
encodes the truth about our history. We have no right to obliterate it,
like vandals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alison eyed me nervously. What was this-majority rule? Yuen
was the only one with any power here; he could pull the plug in an
instant. And yet it was clear from his demeanor that he wanted a
consensus-he wanted our moral support for any decision.</p>

<p>I said cautiously, &ldquo;If we smooth the border,
that&rsquo;ll make it literally impossible for IA to exploit the
defect, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alison shook her head. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know
that. There may be a quantum-like component of spontaneous defections,
even for statements that appear to be in perfect equilibrium.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuen countered, &ldquo;Then there could be spontaneous
defections anywhere-even far from any border. Erasing the whole
structure will guarantee nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will guarantee that IA won&rsquo;t find it!
Maybe pin-point defections do occur, all the time-but the next time
they&rsquo;re tested, they&rsquo;ll always revert.
They&rsquo;re surrounded by explicit contradictions, they have no
chance of getting a foothold. You can&rsquo;t compare a few
transient glitches with this&hellip; armory of
counter-mathematics!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The defect bristled on the screen like a giant caltrap. Alison
and Yuen both turned to me expectantly. As I opened my mouth, the work
station chimed. The software had examined the alternatives in detail:
destroying the entire far side would take Luminous twenty-three minutes
and seventeen seconds-about a minute less than we had left, Sealing the
border would take more than an hour.</p>

<p>I said, &ldquo;That can&rsquo;t be right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alison groaned. &ldquo;But it is! There&rsquo;s random
interference going on at the border from other systems all the time-and
doing anything finicky there means coping with that noise, fighting it.
Charging ahead and pushing the border inward is different: you can
exploit the noise to speed the advance. It&rsquo;s not a question
of dealing with a mere surface versus dealing with a whole volume.
It&rsquo;s more like&hellip; trying to carve an island into an
absolutely perfect circle, while waves are constantly crashing on the
beach-versus bulldozing the whole thing into the ocean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had thirty seconds to decide-or we&rsquo;d be doing
neither today. And maybe Yuen had the resources to keep the map safe
from IA, while we waited a month or more for another session on
Luminous-but I wasn&rsquo;t prepared to live with that kind of
uncertainty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say we get rid of the whole thing. Anything less
is too dangerous. Future mathematicians will still be able to study the
map-and if no one believes that the defect itself ever really existed,
that&rsquo;s just too bad. IA is too close. We can&rsquo;t risk
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alison had one hand poised above the keyboard. I turned to
Yuen; he was staring at the floor, with an anguished expression.
He&rsquo;d let us state our views-but in the end, it was his
decision.</p>

<p>He looked up, and spoke sadly but decisively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay. Do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alison hit the key-with about three seconds to spare. I sagged
into my chair, light headed with relief.</p>

<p>We watched the far side shrinking. The process
didn&rsquo;t look quite as crass as bulldozing an island-more like
dissolving some quirkily beautiful crystal in acid. Now that the danger
was receding before our eyes, though, I was beginning to suffer faint
pangs of regret. Our mathematics had coexisted with this strange
anomaly for fifteen billion years, and it shamed me to think that
within months of its discovery, we&rsquo;d backed ourselves into a
corner where we&rsquo;d had no choice but to destroy it.</p>

<p>Yuen seemed transfixed by the process. &ldquo;So are we
breaking the laws of physics-or enforcing them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alison said, &ldquo;Neither. We&rsquo;re merely
changing what the laws imply.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed softly. &ldquo; &lsquo;Merely.&rsquo;
For some esoteric set of complex systems, we&rsquo;re rewriting the
high-level rules of their behavior. Not including the human brain, I
hope.&rdquo; &lsquo;</p>

<p>My skin crawled. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think
that&rsquo;s&hellip; unlikely?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was joking.&rdquo; He hesitated, then added
soberly, &ldquo;Unlikely for humans-but someone could be relying on
this, somewhere. We might be destroying the whole basis of their
existence: certainties as fundamental to them as a child&rsquo;s
multiplication tables are to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alison could barely conceal her scorn. &ldquo;This is junk
mathematics-a relic of a pointless accident. Any kind of life that
evolved from simple to complex forms would have no use for it. Our
mathematics works for&hellip; rocks, seeds, animals in the herd,
members of the tribe. This only kicks in beyond the number of particles
in the universe-&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or smaller systems that represent those
numbers,&rdquo; I reminded her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you think life somewhere might have a burning
need to do nonstandard trans-astronomical arithmetic, in order to
survive? I doubt that very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We fell silent. Guilt and relief could fight it out later, but
no one suggested halting the program. In the end, maybe nothing could
outweigh the havoc the defect would have caused if it had ever been
harnessed as a weapon-and I was looking forward to composing a long
message to Industrial Algebra, informing them of precisely what
we&rsquo;d done to the object of their ambitions.</p>

<p>Alison pointed to a corner of the screen.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; A narrow dark spike
protruded from the shrinking cluster of statements. For a moment I
thought it was merely avoiding the near side&rsquo;s assault-but it
wasn&rsquo;t. It was slowly, steadily growing longer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could be a bug in the mapping algorithm.&rdquo;
I reached for the keyboard and zoomed in on the structure. In close-up,
it was several thousand statements wide. At its border,
Alison&rsquo;s program could be seen in action, testing statements
in an order designed to force tendrils of the near side ever deeper
into the interior. This slender extrusion, ringed by contradictory
mathematics, should have been corroded out of existence in a fraction
of a second. Something was actively countering the assault,
though-repairing every trace of damage before it could spread.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If IA have a bug here-&rdquo; I turned to Yuen.
&ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t take on Luminous directly, so they
couldn&rsquo;t stop the whole far side shrinking-but a tiny
structure like this&hellip; what do you think? Could they stabilize
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he conceded. &ldquo;Four or
five hundred top-speed work stations could do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alison was typing frantically on her notepad. She said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m writing a patch to identify any systematic
interference-and divert all our resources against it.&rdquo; She
brushed her hair out of her eyes. &ldquo;Look over my shoulder,
will you, Bruno? Check me as I go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; I read through what
she&rsquo;d written so far. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing fine.
Stay calm.&rdquo; Her hands were trembling.</p>

<p>The spike continued to grow steadily. By the time the patch
was ready, the map was re-scaling constantly to fit it on the screen.</p>

<p>Alison triggered the patch. An overlay of electric blue
appeared along the spike, flagging the concentration of computing
power-and the spike abruptly froze.</p>

<p>I held my breath, waiting for IA to notice what we&rsquo;d
done-and switch their resources elsewhere? If they did, no second spike
would appear-they&rsquo;d never get that far-but the blue marker on
the screen would shift to the site where they&rsquo;d regrouped and
tried to make it happen.</p>

<p>But the blue glow didn&rsquo;t move from the existing
spike. And the spike didn&rsquo;t vanish under the weight of
Luminous&rsquo;s undivided efforts.</p>

<p>Instead, it began to grow again, slowly.</p>

<p>Yuen looked ill. &ldquo;This is not Industrial Algebra.
There&rsquo;s no computer on the planet-&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alison laughed derisively. &ldquo;What are you saying now?
Aliens who need the far side are defending it? Aliens where? Nothing
we&rsquo;ve done has had time to reach even&hellip;
Jupiter.&rdquo; There was an edge of hysteria in her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you measured how fast the changes propagate?
Do you know, for certain, that they can&rsquo;t travel faster than
light-with the far-side mathematics undermining the logic of
relativity?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said, &ldquo;Whoever it is, they&rsquo;re not
defending all their borders. They&rsquo;re putting everything
they&rsquo;ve got into the spike.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re aiming at something. A specific
target.&rdquo; Yuen reached over Alison&rsquo;s shoulder for
the keyboard. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re shutting this down. Right
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned on him, blocking his way. &ldquo;Are you crazy?
We&rsquo;re almost holding them off! I&rsquo;ll rewrite the
program, fine-tune it, get an edge in efficiency-&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! We stop threatening them, then see how they
react. We don&rsquo;t know what harm we&rsquo;re
doing-&rdquo;</p>

<p>He reached for the keyboard again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alison jabbed him in the throat with her elbow, hard. He
staggered backward, gasping for breath, then crashed to the floor,
bringing a chair down on top him. She hissed at me,
&ldquo;Quick-shut him up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hesitated, loyalties fracturing, his idea had sounded
perfectly sane to me. But if he started yelling for security-</p>

<p>I crouched down over him, pushed the chair aside, then clasped
my hand over his mouth, forcing his head back with pressure on the
lower jaw. We&rsquo;d have to tie him up-and then try brazenly
marching out of the building without him. But he&rsquo;d be found
in a matter of minutes. Even if we made it past the gate, we were
screwed.</p>

<p>Yuen caught his breath and started struggling; I clumsily
pinned his arms with my knees. I could hear Alison typing, a ragged
staccato, tried to get a glimpse of the work station screen, but I
couldn&rsquo;t turn that far without taking my weight off Yuen.</p>

<p>I said, &ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s right-maybe we should
pull back, and see what happens.&rdquo; If the alterations could
propagate faster than light&hellip; how many distant civilizations
might have felt the effects of what we&rsquo;d done? Our first
contact with extraterrestrial life could turn out to be an attempt to
obliterate mathematics that they viewed as&hellip; what? A precious
resource? A sacred relic? An essential component of their entire world
view?</p>

<p>The sound of typing stopped abruptly. &ldquo;Bruno? Do you
feel-?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuen seemed to have given up the fight. I risked turning
around.</p>

<p>Alison was hunched forward, her face in her hands. On the
screen the spike had ceased its relentless linear growth-but now an
elaborate. dendritic structure had blossomed at its tip. I glanced down
at Yuen; he seemed dazed, oblivious to my presence. I took my hand from
his mouth warily. He lay there placidly, smiling faintly, eyes scanning
something I couldn&rsquo;t see.</p>

<p>I climbed to my feet. I took Alison by the shoulders and shook
he gently; her only response was to press her face harder into her
hands. The spike&rsquo;s strange flower was still growing but it
wasn&rsquo;t spreading out into new territory; it was sending
narrow shoots back in on itself crisscrossing the same region again and
again with ever finer structure</p>

<p>Weaving a net? Searching for something?</p>

<p>It hit me with a jolt of clarity more intense than anything
I&rsquo;d felt since childhood. It was like reliving the moment
when the whole concept numbers had finally snapped into place-but with
an adult&rsquo;s understanding of everything it opened up,
everything it implied. It was a lightning bolt revelation-but there was
no taint of mystical confusion: no opiate haze of euphoria, no
pseudo-sexual rush. In the clean-lined logic of the simplest concepts,
I saw and understood exactly how the world worked-</p>

<p>-except that it was all wrong, it was all false, it was all
impossible.</p>

<p>Quicksand.</p>

<p>Assailed by vertigo, I swept my gaze around the room-counting
frantically: Six work stations. Two people. Six chairs. I grouped the
work stations: three sets of two, two sets of three. One and five, two
and four; four and two, five and one.</p>

<p>I weaved a dozen cross-checks for consistency-for
sanity&hellip; but everything added up.</p>

<p>They hadn&rsquo;t stolen the old arithmetic;
they&rsquo;d merely blasted the new one into my head, on top of it.</p>

<p>Whoever had resisted our assault with Luminous had reached
down with the spike and rewritten our neural metamathematics-the
arithmetic that underlay our own reasoning about arithmetic-enough to
let us glimpse what we&rsquo;d been trying to destroy.</p>

<p>Alison was uncommunicative, but she was breathing slowly and
steadily. Yuen seemed fine, lost in a happy reverie. I relaxed
slightly, and began trying to make sense of the flood of far-side
arithmetic surging through my brain.</p>

<p>On their own terms, the axioms were&hellip; trivial,
obvious. I could see that they corresponded to elaborate statements
about trans-astronomical integers, but performing an exact translation
was far beyond me-and thinking about the entities they described in
terms of the huge integers they represented was a bit like thinking
about pi or the square root of two in terms of the first ten thousand
digits of their decimal expansion: it would be missing the point
entirely. These alien &ldquo;numbers&rdquo;-the basic objects
of the alternative arithmetic-had found a way to embed themselves in
the integers, and to relate to each other in a simple, elegant way-and
if the messy corollaries they implied upon translation contradicted the
rules integers were supposed to obey&hellip; well, only a small,
remote patch of obscure truths had been subverted,</p>

<p>Someone touched me on the shoulder. I started-but Yuen was
beaming amiably, all arguments and violence forgotten.</p>

<p>He said, &ldquo;Lightspeed is not violated. All the logic
that requires that remains intact.&rdquo; I could only take him at
his word; the result would have taken me hours to prove. Maybe the
aliens had done a better job on him-or maybe he was just a superior
mathematician in either system.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then&hellip; where are they?&rdquo; At
lightspeed, our attack on the far side could not have been felt any
further away than Mars-and the strategy used to block the corrosion of
the spike would have been impossible with even a few seconds&rsquo;
time lag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The atmosphere?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean-Earth&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where else? Or maybe the oceans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I sat down heavily. Maybe it was no stranger than any
conceivable alternative, but I still balked at the implications.</p>

<p>Yuen said, &ldquo;To us, their structure
wouldn&rsquo;t look like &lsquo;structure&rsquo; at all.
The simplest unit might involve a group of thousands of
atoms-representing a trans-astronomical number-not necessarily even
bonded together in any conventional way, but breaking the normal
consequences of the laws of physics, obeying a different set of
high-level rules that arise frorn the alternative mathematics. People
have often mused about the chances of intelligence being coded into
long-lived vortices on distant gas giants&hellip; but these
creatures won&rsquo;t be in hurricanes or tornadoes.
They&rsquo;ll be drifting in the most innocuous puffs of
air-invisible as neutrinos.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unstable-&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only according to our mathematics. Which does not
apply.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alison broke in suddenly, angrily. &ldquo;Even if all of
this is true-where does it get us? Whether the defect supports a whole
invisible ecosystem or not-LA will still find it, and use it, in
exactly the same way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment I was dumbstruck. We were facing the prospect of
sharing the planet with an undiscovered civilization-and all she could
think about was IA&rsquo;s grubby machinations?</p>

<p>She was absolutely right, though. Long before any of these
extravagant fantasies could be proved or disproved, IA could still do
untold harm.</p>

<p>I said, &ldquo;Leave the mapping software running-but shut
down the shrinker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She glanced at the screen. &ldquo;No need.
They&rsquo;ve overpowered it-or undermined its
mathematics.&rdquo; The far side was back to its original size.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s nothing to lose. Shut it
down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did. No longer under attack, the spike began to reverse
its growth. I felt a pang of loss as my limited grasp of the far-side
mathematics suddenly evaporated; I tried to hold on, but it was like
clutching at air.</p>

<p>When the spike had retracted completely, I said,
&ldquo;Now we try doing an Industrial Algebra. We try bringing the
defect closer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were almost out of time, but it was easy enough-in thirty
seconds, we rewrote the shrinking algorithm to function in reverse.</p>

<p>Alison programmed a function key with the commands to revert
to the original version-so that if the experiment backfired, one
keystroke would throw the full weight of Luminous behind a defense of
the near side again.</p>

<p>Yuen and I exchanged nervous glances. I said, &ldquo;Maybe
this wasn&rsquo;t such a good idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alison disagreed. &ldquo;We need to know how
they&rsquo;ll react to this. Better we find out now than leave it
to IA.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She started the program running.</p>

<p>The sea-urchin began to swell, slowly. I broke out in a sweat.
The farsiders hadn&rsquo;t harmed us, so far-but this felt like
tugging hard at a door that you really, badly, didn&rsquo;t want to
see thrown open.</p>

<p>A technician poked her head into the room and announced
cheerfully, &ldquo;Down for maintenance in two minutes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuen said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, there&rsquo;s
nothing-&rdquo;</p>

<p>The whole far side turned electric blue. Alison&rsquo;s
original patch had detected a systematic intervention.</p>

<p>We zoomed in. Luminous was picking off vulnerable statements
of the near side-but something else was repairing the damage.</p>

<p>I let out a strangled noise that might have been a cheer.
Alison smiled serenely. She said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m satisfied.
IA don&rsquo;t stand a chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuen mused, &ldquo;Maybe they have a reason to defend the
status quo-maybe they rely on the border itself, as much as the far
side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alison shut down our reversed shrinker. The blue glow
vanished; both sides were leaving the defect alone. And there were a
thousand questions we all wanted answered-but the technicians had
thrown the master switch, and Luminous itself had ceased to exist.</p>

<p>The sun was breaking through the skyline as we rode back into
the city. As we pulled up outside the hotel, Alison started shaking and
sobbing. I sat beside her, squeezing her hand. I knew she&rsquo;d
felt the weight of what might have happened, all along, far more than I
had.</p>

<p>I paid the driver, and then we stood on the street for a
while, silently watching the cyclists go by, trying to imagine how the
world would change as it tried to embrace this new contradiction
between the exotic and the mundane, the pragmatic and the Platonic, the
visible and the invisible.</p>
