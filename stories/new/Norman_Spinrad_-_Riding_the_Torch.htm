<H1>RIDING THE TORCH</H1>
<H3>Norman Spinrad</H3>
<H3>I</H3>
<P>Flashing rainbows from his skintight mirror suit,
flourishing a swirl of black cape, Jofe D'mahl burst through the
shimmer screen that formed the shipside wall of his grand salon to
the opening bars of Beethoven's <I>Fifth Symphony. </I>The shimmer
rippled through the spectrum as his flesh passed through it, visually
announcing his presence with quicksilver strobes of dopplering light.
Heads turned, bodies froze, and the party stopped for a good long
beat as he greeted his guests with an ironic half-bow. The party
resumed its rhythm as he walked across the misty floor toward a
floating tray of flashers. He had made his entrance.</P>
<P>D'mahl selected a purple sphere, popped the
flasher into his mouth, and bit through an exquisite brittle
sponginess into an overwhelming surge of velvet, a gustatory orgasm.
A first collection by one Lina Wolder, Jiz had said, and as usual she
had picked a winner. He tapped the name into his memory banks, keying
it to the sensorium track of the last ten seconds, and filed it in
his current party listing. Yes indeed, a rising star to remember.</P>
<P>Tapping the floater to follow him, he strode
through the knee-high multicolored fog, nodding, turning, bestowing
glances of his deep green eyes, savoring the ambience he had brought
into being.</P>
<P>D'mahl had wheedled Hiro Korakin himself into
designing the grand salon as his interpretation of D'mahl's own
personality. Korakin had hung an immense semicircular slab of simmed
emerald out from the hull of the ship itself and had blistered this
huge balcony in transparent plex, giving D'mahl's guests a
breathtaking and uncompromising view of humanity's universe. As
<I>Excelsior </I>was near the center of the Trek, the great concourse
of ships tiaraed the salon's horizon line, a triumphant jeweled city
of coruscating light. Ten kilometers bow-ward, the hydrogen interface
was an auroral skin stretched across the unseemly nakedness of
interstellar space.</P>
<P>But to look over the edge of the balcony, down the
sleek and brilliantly lit precipice of <I>Excelsior's </I>cylindrical
hull, was to be confronted by a vista that sucked slobbering at the
soul: the bottomless interstellar abyss, an infinite black pit in
which the myriad stars were but iridescent motes of unimportant dust,
a nothingness that went on forever in space and time. At some
indefinable point down there in the blackness, the invisible output
of <I>Excelsior's </I>torch merged with those of two thousand and
thirty-nine other ships to form an ethereal comet's tail of
all-but-invisible purplish fire that dwindled off into a frail thread
which seemed to go on forever down into the abyss: the wake of the
Trek, reeling backward in space and time for hundreds of light-years
and nearly ten centuries, a visible track that the eye might
seemingly follow backward through the ages to the lost garden, Earth.</P>
<P>Jofe D'mahl knew full well that many of his guests
found this prime reality visualization of their basic existential
position unsettling, frightening, perhaps even in bad taste. But that
was <I>their </I>problem; D'mahl himself found the view bracing,
which, of course, justifiably elevated his own already high opinion
of himself. Korakin wasn't considered the best psychetect on the Trek
for nothing.</P>
<P>But D'mahl himself had decorated the salon, with
the inevitable assistance of Jiz Rumoku. On the translucent emerald
floor he had planted a tinkling forest of ruby, sapphire, diamond,
and amethyst trees&mdash;cunningly detailed sims of the ancient
life-forms that waved flashing crystal leaves with every subtle
current of air. He had topped off the effect with the scented fog
that picked up blue, red, and lavender tints from the internally
incandescent trees, and customarily kept the gravity at .8 gs to sync
with the faerie mood. To soften the crystal edges, Jiz had gotten him
a collection of forty fuzzballs: downy globs in subdued green, brown,
mustard, and gray that floated about randomly at floor level until
someone sat in them. If Korakin had captured D'mahl's clear-eyed
core, Jofe had expressed the neobaroque style of his recent sensos,
and to D'mahl, the combined work of art sang of the paradox that was
the Trek. To his guests, it sang of the paradox that was Jofe D'mahl.
Egowise, D'mahl himself did not deign to make this distinction.</P>
<P>The guest list was also a work of art in D'mahl's
neobaroque style: a constellation of people designed to rub purringly
here, jangle like broken glass there, generate cross-fertilization
someplace else, keep the old karmic kettle boiling. Jans Ryn was
displaying herself as usual to a mixed bag that included <I>Excelsior's
</I>chief torchtender, two dirtdiggers from <I>Kantuck, </I>and Tanya
Daivis, the velvet asp. A heated discussion between Dalta Reed and
Trombleau, the astrophysicist from <I>Glade, </I>was drawing another
conspicuous crowd. Less conspicuous guests were floating about doing
less conspicuous things. The party needed a catalyst to really start
torching up lights.</P>
<P>And at 24.00 that catalyst would zap itself right
into their sweet little taps&mdash;the premiere tapping of Jofe
D'mahl's new senso, <I>Wandering Dutchmen. </I>D'mahl had carved
something prime out of the void, and he knew it.</P>
<P>&quot;&mdash;by backbreeding beyond the point of
original radiation, and then up the line to the elm&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;&mdash;like a thousand suns, as they said at
Alamagordo, Jans, and it's only a bulkhead and a fluxfield away&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;&mdash;how Promethean you must feel&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Jof, this nova claims he's isolated a
spectral pattern synced to organic life,&quot; Dalta called out,
momentarily drawing D'mahl into her orbit.</P>
<P>&quot;In a starscan tape?&quot; D'mahl asked
dubiously.</P>
<P>&quot;In theory,&quot; Trombleau admitted.</P>
<P>&quot;Where've I heard that one before?&quot;
D'mahl said, popping another of the Wolder flashers. It wriggled
through his teeth, then exploded in a burst of bittersweet that
almost immediately faded into a lingering smoky aftertaste. Not bad,
D'mahl thought, dancing away from Trombleau's open mouth before he
could get sucked into the argument.</P>
<P>D'mahl flitted through the mists, goosed Ami
Simkov, slapped Darius Warner on the behind, came upon a group of
guests surrounding John Benina, who had viewpointed the Dutchman.
They were trying to pump him about the senso, but John knew that if
he blatted before the premiere, his chances of working with Jofe
D'mahl again were exactly zip.</P>
<P>&quot;Come on, Jofe, tell us something about
<I>Wandering Dutchmen,&quot; </I>begged a woman wearing a cloud of
bright-yellow mist. D'mahl couldn't remember her with his flesh, but
didn't bother tapping for it. Instead, he bit into a cubical flasher
that atomized at the touch of his teeth, whiting out every synapse in
his mouth for a mad micropulse. Feh.</P>
<P>&quot;Two hints,&quot; D'mahl said. &quot;John
Benina played one of the two major viewpoints, and it's a mythmash.&quot;</P>
<P>A great collective groan went up, under cover of
which D'mahl ricocheted away in the direction of Jiz Rumoku, who was
standing in a green mist with someone he couldn't make out.</P>
<P>Jiz Rumoku was the only person privileged to bring
her own guests to D'mahl's parties, and just about the only person
not involved in the production who had any idea of what <I>Wandering
Dutchmen </I>was about. If Jofe D'mahl could be said to have a souler
(a dubious assumption), she was it.</P>
<P>She was dressed, as usual, in tomorrow's latest
fashion: a pants suit of iridescent, rigid-seeming green-and-purple
material, a mosaic of planar geometric forms that approximated the
curves of her body like a medieval suit of armor. But the facets of
her suit articulated subtly with her tiniest motion&mdash;a fantastic
insectile effect set off by a tall plumelike crest into which her
long black hair had been static-molded.</P>
<P>But D'mahl's attention was drawn to her companion,
for he was obviously a voidsucker. He wore nothing but blue briefs
and thin brown slippers; there was not a speck of hair on his body,
and his bald head was tinted silver. But persona aside, his eyes
alone would have instantly marked him: windows of blue plex into an
infinite universe of utter blackness confined by some topological
legerdemain inside his gleaming skull.</P>
<P>D'mahl tapped the voidsucker's visual image to the
banks. &quot;I.D.,&quot; he subvoced. The name &quot;Haris Bandoora&quot;
appeared in his mind. &quot;Data brief,&quot; D'mahl subvoced.</P>
<P>&quot;Haris Bandoora, fifty standard years,
currently commanding scout-ship Bela-37, returned to Trek 4.987 last
Tuesday. Report unavailable at this realtime.&quot;</P>
<P>Jiz had certainly come up with something tasty
this time, a void-sucker so fresh from the great zilch that the
Council of Pilots hadn't yet released his report.</P>
<P>&quot;Welcome back to civilization, such as it is,
Commander Bandoora,&quot; D'mahl said.</P>
<P>Bandoora turned the vacuum of his eyes on D'mahl.
&quot;Such as it is,&quot; he said, in a cold clear voice that seemed
to sum up, judge, and dismiss all of human history in four dead
syllables.</P>
<P>D'mahl looked away from those black pits, looked
into Jiz's almond eyes, and they cross-tapped each other's sensoriums
for a moment in private greeting. Jofe saw his own mirrored body,
felt the warmth it evoked in her. He kissed his lips with Jiz's,
tasting the electric smokiness of the flashers he had eaten. As their
lips parted, they broke their taps simultaneously.</P>
<P>&quot;What's in that report of yours that the
Pilots haven't released to the banks yet, Bandoora?&quot; D'mahl
asked conversationally. (How else could you make small talk with a
voidsucker?)</P>
<P>Bandoora's thin lips parted in what might have
been a smile, or just as easily a grimace of pain. D'mahl sensed that
the man's emotional parameters were truly alien to his experience,
prime or simmed. He had never paid attention to the voidsuckers
before, and he wondered why. There was one beyond senso to be made on
the subject!</P>
<P>&quot;They've found <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">a</SPAN><I>
</I>planet,&quot; Jiz said. &quot;There's going to be a blanket
bulletin at 23.80.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Drool,&quot; D'mahl said, nuancing the word
with most of the feelings that this flash stirred up. The voidsuckers
were always reporting back with some hot new solar system, turning
the Trek for a few months while they high-geed for a telltale peek,
then turning the Trek again for the next Ultima Thule just as the
flash hit that the last one was the usual slokyard of rock and
puke-gas. The voidsuckers had been leading the Trek in a zigzag
stagger through space from one vain hope to another for the better
part of a millennium; the latest zig was therefore hardly a cosmic
flash in Jofe D'mahl's estimation. But it <I>would </I>be a
three-month wonder at least, and tapping out a blanket bulletin just
before the premiere was a prime piece of upstaging, a real boot in
the ego. Drool.</P>
<P>&quot;The probabilities look good on this one,&quot;
Bandoora said.</P>
<P>&quot;They always do, don't they?&quot; D'mahl
said snidely. &quot;And it always turns out the same. If there's a
rock in the habitable zone, it's got gravity that'd pull your head
off, or the atmosphere is a tasty mixture of hydrogen cyanide and
fluorine. Bandoora, don't you ever get the feeling that some
nonexistent cosmic personage is trying to tell you something you
don't want to hear?&quot;</P>
<P>Bandoora's inner expression seemed, to crinkle
behind his impassive flesh. A tic made his lower lip tremble. What
did I do <I>this </I>time? D'mahl wondered. These voidsuckers must be
far beyond along some pretty strange vectors.</P>
<P>Jiz forced a laugh. &quot;The torch Jof is riding
is all ego,&quot; she said. &quot;He's just singed because the
bulletin is going to bleed some H from his premiere. Isn't that
right, Jof, you egomonster, you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Don't knock ego,&quot; D'mahl said. &quot;It's
all that stands between us and the lamer universe we have the bad
taste to be stuck in. Since my opinion of myself is the only thing I
know of higher in the karmic pecking order than my own magnificent
being, my ego is the only thing I've found worth worshiping. Know
what that makes me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Insufferable?&quot; Jiz suggested.</P>
<P>&quot;A human being,&quot; D'mahl said. &quot;I'm
stuck with it, so I might as well enjoy it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A bulletin from the Council of Pilots.&quot;
The words intruded themselves into D'mahl's mind with a reasonable
degree of gentleness, an improvement over the days when the Pilots
had felt they had the right to snap you into full sensory fugue on
the spot whenever the spirit moved them. &quot;Ten . . . nine . . .
eight . . . seven . . .&quot; D'mahl pulled over a green fuzzball and
anchored the floating cloud of particles by planting his posterior in
it. Jiz and Bandoora sat down flanking him. &quot;Six . . . five . .
. four . . .&quot;</P>
<P>Whichever guests were standing found themselves
seats; there was no telling how long one of these bulletins would
last. The Pilots have a grossly exaggerated sense of their own
importance, D'mahl thought. And what does that make them?</P>
<P>&quot;. . . three . . . two . . . one . . .&quot;</P>
<P>Human beings.</P>
<P>D'mahl sat on a bench at the focus of a small
amphitheater. Tiered around him were two thousand and forty people
wearing the archaic blue military tunics dating back to the time when
Ship's Pilot was a paramilitary rank rather than an elective office.
D'mahl found the uniformity of dress stultifying and the overhead
holo of the day sky of an Earthlike planet banal and oppressive, but
then he found most Pilots, with their naive notion of the Trek's
existential position, somewhat simpleminded and more than a little
pathetic.</P>
<P>Ryan Nakamura, a white-haired man who had been
Chairman of the Council of Pilots longer than anyone cared to
remember, walked slowly toward him, clapped him on the shoulder with
both hands, and sat down beside him. Nakamura smelled of some noxious
perfume designed to sim wisdom-odors of moldy parchment and decayed
sweetness. As an artist, D'mahl found the effect competent if
painfully obvious; as a citizen, he found it patronizing and
offensive.</P>
<P>Nakamura leaned toward him, and as he did, the
amphitheater vanished and they sat cozily alone on an abstract
surface entirely surrounded by a firmament of tightly packed stars.</P>
<P>&quot;Jofe, Scoutship Bela-37 has returned to the
Trek and reported that a solar system containing a potentially
habitable planet is located within a light-year and a half of our
present position,&quot; Nakamura said solemnly.</P>
<P>D'mahl wanted to yawn in the old bore's face, but
of course the viewpoint player hunched him intently toward Nakamura
instead as the Chairman blatted on. &quot;The Council has voted 1,839
to 201 to alter the vector of the Trek toward this system, designated
997-Beta, pending the report of the telltale.&quot;</P>
<P>D'mahl sat midway up in the amphitheater as
Nakamura continued formally from a podium on the floor below. &quot;It
is our earnest hope that our long trek is at last nearing its
successful completion, that in our own lifetimes men will once more
stand on the verdant hills of a living planet, with a sky overhead
and the smells of living things in our nostrils. We conclude this
bulletin with brief excerpts from the report of Haris Bandoora,
commander of Bela-37.&quot;</P>
<P>Behind the podium, Nakamura faded into Haris
Bandoora. &quot;Bela-37 was following a course thirty degrees from
the forward vector of the Trek,&quot; Bandoora said tonelessly.
&quot;Torching at point nine . . .&quot;</P>
<P>D'mahl stood on the bridge of Bela-37&mdash;a
small round chamber rimmed with impressive-looking gadgetry, domed in
somewhat bluish plex to compensate for the doppler shift, but
otherwise visually open to the terrifying glory of the deep void.
However, one of the four voidsuckers on the bridge was a woman who
easily upstaged the stellar spectacle as far as D'mahl was concerned.
She wore briefs and slippers and was totally bald, like the others,
and her skull was tinted silver, but her preternaturally conical
breasts and shining, tightly muscled flesh made what ordinarily would
have been an ugly effect into an abstract paradigm of feminine
beauty. Whether the warmth he felt was his alone, or his reaction
plus that of the viewpoint player, apparently Bandoora himself, was
entirely beside the point.</P>
<P>&quot;Ready to scan and record system 997-Beta,&quot;
the stunning creature said. D'mahl walked closer to her, wanting to
dive into those bottomless voidsucker eyes. Instead, he found his
lips saying, with Bandoora's voice: &quot;Display it, Sidi.&quot;</P>
<P>Sidi did something to the control panel before her
(how archaic!) and the holo of a yellow star about the diameter of a
human head appeared in the geometric center of the bridge. D'mahl
exchanged tense glances with his crew, somatically felt his
expectation rise.</P>
<P>&quot;The planets . . .&quot; he said.</P>
<P>Five small round particles appeared, rotating in
compressed time around the yellow sun.</P>
<P>&quot;The habitable zone . . .&quot;</P>
<P>A transparent green torus appeared around the holo
of 997-Beta. The second planet lay within its boundaries.</P>
<P>There was an audible intake of breath, and D'mahl
felt his own body tremble. &quot;The second planet,&quot; Bandoora's
voice ordered. &quot;At max.&quot;</P>
<P>The holo of the star vanished, replaced by a pale,
fuzzy holo of the second planet, about four times its diameter. The
planet seemed to be mottled with areas of brown, green, blue, yellow,
and purple, but the holo was washed out and wavered as if seen
through miles of heat-haze.</P>
<P>A neuter voice recited instrument readings.
&quot;Estimated gravity 1.2, gs plus or minus ten percent . . .
estimated mean temperature thirty-three degrees centigrade plus or
minus six degrees . . . estimated atmospheric composition: helium,
nitrogen, oxygen as major constituents . . . percentages
indeterminate from present data . . . traces of carbon dioxide,
argon, ammonia, water vapor . . . estimated ratio of liquid area to
solid surface 60-40 . . . composition of oceans indeterminate from
present data. . . .&quot;</P>
<P>D'mahl felt the tension in his body release itself
through his vocal cords in a wordless shout that merged with the
whoops of his companions. He heard his lips say, with Bandoora's
voice: &quot;That's the best prospect any scoutship's turned up
within my lifetime.&quot;</P>
<P>D'mahl was seated in the amphitheater as Bandoora
addressed the Council. &quot;A probe was immediately dispatched to
997-Beta-II. Bela-37 will leave within twenty days to monitor the
probe data wavefront. We estimate that we will be able to bring back
conclusive data within half a standard year.&quot;</P>
<P>D'mahl was an abstract viewpoint in black space. A
huge hazy holo of 997-Beta-II hovered before him like a ghostly
forbidden fruit as the words in his mind announced: &quot;This
concludes the bulletin from the Council of Pilots.&quot;</P>
<P>Everyone in Jofe D'mahl's grand salon immediately
began babbling, gesticulating, milling about excitedly. Head after
head turned in the direction of D'mahl, Jiz, and Bandoora. D'mahl
felt a slow burn rising, knowing to whom the fascinated glances were
directed.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, what do you think of <I>that, </I>Jof?&quot;
Jiz said, with a sly knife edge in her voice.</P>
<P>&quot;Not badly done,&quot; D'mahl said coolly.
&quot;Hardly art, but effective propaganda, I must admit.&quot;</P>
<P>Once again, Bandoora seemed strangely stricken, as
if D'mahl's words had probed some inner wound.</P>
<P>&quot;The planet, Jof, the <I>planet!&quot;</I></P>
<P>Fighting to control a building wave of anger,
D'mahl managed an arch smile. &quot;I was paying more attention to
Sidi,&quot; he said. &quot;Voidsuckers come up with planets that look
that good from a distance much more often than you see bodies that
look that good that close.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You think the future of the human race is a
rather humorous subject,&quot; Bandoora said loudly, betraying
annoyance for the first time.</P>
<P>D'mahl tapped the time at 23.981. His guests were
all blatting about the prospects of at last finding a viable mudball,
and <I>Wandering Dutchmen </I>was about to begin! Leaping to his
feet, he shouted: &quot;Bandoora, you've been out in the big zilch
too long!&quot; The sheer volume of his voice focused the attention
of every guest on his person. &quot;If I were confined in a scoutship
with Sidi, I'd have something better than slok planets on my mind!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You're a degenerate and an egomaniac,
D'mahl!&quot; Bandoora blatted piously, drawing the laughter D'mahl
had hoped for.</P>
<P>&quot;Guilty on both counts,&quot; D'mahl said.
&quot;Sure I'm an egomaniac&mdash;like everyone else, I'm the only
god there is. Of course I'm a degenerate, and so is everyone
else&mdash;soft protoplasmic machines that begin to degenerate from
day one!&quot;</P>
<P>All at once D'mahl had penetrated the serious mood
that the bulletin had imposed on his party, and by donning it and
taking it one step beyond, had recaptured the core. &quot;We're stuck
where we are and with what we are. We're Flying Dutchmen on an
endless sea of space, we're Wandering Jews remembering what we killed
for all eternity&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>A great groan went up, undertoned with laughter at
the crude bridge to the impending premiere, overtoned with sullenness
at the reminder of just who and what they were. D'mahl had blown
it&mdash;or at least failed to entirely recover&mdash;and he knew it,
and the knowledge was a red nova inside his skull. At this moment of
foul karma, 2,4.000 passed into realtime, and on tap frequency E-6&mdash;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>You are standing at the base of a gentle verdant
hill on whose tree-dotted summit a man in a loincloth is being nailed
to a cross. Each time the mallet descends, you feel piercing pains in
your wrists. You stand in an alleyway in ancient Jerusalem holding a
jug of water to your breast as Jesus is dragged to his doom, and you
feel his terrible hopeless thirst parching your throat. You are back
at Calvary listening to the beat of the mallet, feeling the
lightnings of pain in your wrists, the taste of burning sands in your
mouth.</P>
<P>You are on the quarterdeck of an ancient wooden
sailing ship tasting the salt wind of an ocean storm. The sky roils
and howls under an evil green moon. Your crew scurries about the deck
and rigging, shouting and moaning in thin spectral voices, creatures
of tattered rags and ghostly transparent flesh. Foam flies into your
face, and you wipe it off with the back of your hand, seeing through
your own flesh as it passes before your eyes. You feel laughter at
the back of your throat, and it bubbles out of you&mdash;too loud,
too hearty, a maniac's howl. You raise your foglike fist and brandish
it at the heavens. Lightning bolts crackle. You shake your fist
harder and inhale the storm wind like the breath of a lover.</P>
<P>You look up the slope of Calvary as the final
stroke of the mallet is driven home and you feel the wooden handle
and the iron spike in your own hands. The cross is erected, and it is
you who hangs from it, and the sky is dissolved in a deafening blast
of light brighter than a thousand suns. And you are trudging on an
endless plain of blowing gray ash under a sky the color of rusting
steel. The jagged ruins of broken buildings protrude from the
swirling dust, and the world is full of maimed and skeletal people
marching from horizon to horizon without hope. But your body has the
plodding leaden strength of a thing that knows it cannot die. Pain in
your wrists, and ashes in your mouth. The people around you begin to
rot on their feet, to melt like Dali watches, and then only you
remain, custodian of a planetary corpse. A ghostly sailing ship
approaches you, luffing and pitching on the storm-whipped ash.</P>
<P>The quarterdeck pitches under your feet and the
skies howl. Then the storm clouds around the moon melt away to reveal
a cool utter blackness punctuated by myriad hard points of light, and
the quarterdeck becomes a steel bulkhead under your feet and you are
standing in an observation bubble of a primitive first-generation
torchship. Around your starry horizon are dozens of other converted
asteroid freighters, little more than fusion torchtubes with
makeshift domes, blisters, and toroid decks cobbled to their
surfaces&mdash;the distant solar ancestors of the Trek.</P>
<P>You turn to see an ancient horror standing beside
you: an old, old man, his face scarred by radiation, his soul scarred
by bottomless guilt, and his black eyes burning coldly with eternal
ice.</P>
<P>You are standing in an observation bubble of a
first-generation torch-ship. Below, the Earth is a brownish, singed,
cancerous ball still stewing in the radiation of the Slow Motion War.
Somewhere <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">a</SPAN><I> </I>bell is
tolling, and you can feel the tug of the bellrope in your hands.
Turning, you see a lean, sinister man with a face all flat planes and
eyes like blue coals. His face fades into fog for a moment, and only
those mad eyes remain solid and real.</P>
<P>&quot;Hello, Dutchman,&quot; you say.</P>
<P>&quot;Hello, Refugee.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'm usually called Wanderer.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's no longer much of a distinction,&quot;
the Dutchman says. &quot;All men are wanderers now.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We're all refugees too. We've killed the
living world that gave us birth. Even you and I may never live to see
another.&quot; The bite of the nails into your wrists, the weight of
the mallet in your hand. Thirst, and the tolling of a far-off bell.</P>
<P>You are the Dutchman, looking out into the
universal night; a generation to the nearest star, a century to the
nearest hope of a living world, forever to the other side. Thunder
rolls inside your head and lightnings flash behind your eyes. &quot;We've
got these decks under our feet, the interstellar wind to ride, and
fusion torches to ride it with,&quot; you say.</P>
<P>&quot;Don't whine to me, I've never had more.&quot;
</P>
<P>You laugh a wild maniac howl. &quot;And I've got
plenty of company, now.&quot;</P>
<P>You are the Wanderer, looking down at the slain
Earth, listening to the bell toll, feeling the dead weight of the
mallet in your hand. &quot;So do I, Dutchman, so do I.&quot;</P>
<P>The globe of the Earth transforms itself into
another world: <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">a</SPAN><I>
</I>brown-and-purple planetary continent marbled with veins and lakes
of watery blue. Clad in a heavy spacesuit, you are standing on the
surface of the planet: naked rock on the shore of a clear blue lake,
under a violet sky laced with thin gray clouds like jet contrails. A
dozen other suited men are fanned out across the plain of fractured
rock, like ants crawling on a bone pile.</P>
<P>&quot;Dead,&quot; you say. &quot;A corpse-world.&quot;</P>
<P>Maniac laughter beside you. &quot;Don't be morbid,
Wanderer. Nothing is dead that was never alive.&quot;</P>
<P>You kneel on a patch of furrowed soil cupping a
wilted pine seedling in your hands. The sky above you is steel
plating studded with overhead floodlights, and the massive
cylindrical body of the torchtube skewers the watertank universe of
this dirtdigger deck. The whole layout is primitive, strictly
first-generation Trek. Beside you, a young girl in green dirtdigger
shorts and shirt is sitting disconsolately on the synthetic loam,
staring at the curved outer bulkhead of the farm deck.</P>
<P>&quot;I'm going to live and die without ever
seeing a sky or walking in a forest,&quot; she says. &quot;What am I
doing here? What's all this for?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You're keeping the embers of Earth alive,&quot;
you say in your ancient's voice. &quot;You're preserving the last
surviving forms of organic life. Some day your children or your
children's children will plant these seeds in the living soil of a
new Earth.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you really believe that?&quot; she says
earnestly, turning her youthful strength on you like a sun. &quot;That
we'll find a living planet some day?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You must believe. If you stop believing,
you'll be with us here in this hell of our own creation. We Earthborn
were life's destroyers. Our children must be life's preservers.&quot;</P>
<P>She looks at you with the Wanderer's cold eternal
eyes, and her face withers to a parchment of ancient despair. &quot;For
the sake of our bloodstained souls?&quot; she says, then becomes a
young girl once more.</P>
<P>&quot;For the sake of your own, girl, for the sake
of your own.&quot;</P>
<P>You float weightless inside the huddled circle of
the Trek. The circular formation of ships is a lagoon of light in an
endless sea of black nothingness. Bow-ward of the Trek, the
interstellar abyss is hidden behind <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">a</SPAN><I>
</I>curtain of gauzy brilliance: the hydrogen interface, where the
combined scoopfields of the Trek's fusion torches form a permanent
shock wave against the attenuated interstellar atmosphere. Although
the Trek's ships have already been modified and aligned to form the
hydrogen interface, the ships are still the same converted asteroid
freighters that left Sol; this is no later than Trek Year 150.</P>
<P>But inside the circle of ships, the future is
being launched. The <I>Flying Dutchman, </I>the first torchship to be
built entirely on the Trek out of matter winnowed and transmuted from
the interstellar medium, floats in the space before you, surrounded
by a gnat swarm of intership shuttles and men and women in voidsuits.
A clean, smooth cylinder ringed with windowed decks, it seems out of
place among the messy jury-rigging of the first-generation
torchships, an intrusion from the future.</P>
<P>Then an all-but-invisible purple flame issues from
the <I>Dutchman's </I>torchtube and the first Trekborn ship is
drawing its breath of life.</P>
<P>Another new torchship appears beside the <I>Flying
Dutchman, </I>and another and another and another, until the new
Trekborn ships outnumber the converted asteroid freighters and the
hydrogen interface has more than doubled in diameter. Now the area
inside the Trek is a vast concourse of torchships, shuttles, suited
people, and the dancing lights of civilized life.</P>
<P>You are standing on a bulkhead catwalk overlooking
the floor of a dirtdigger deck: a sparse forest of small pines and
oaks, patches of green grass, a few rows of flowers. Above is a holo
of a blue Earth sky with fleecy white clouds. Dirtdiggers in their
traditional green move about solemnly, tending the fragile
life-forms, measuring their growth. Your nostrils are filled with the
incense odor of holiness.</P>
<P>And you sit at a round simmed marble table on a
balcony cafe halfway up the outer bulkhead of an amusement deck
sipping a glass of simmed burgundy. A circle of shops and restaurants
rings the floor below, connected by radial paths to an inner ring of
shops around the central torchtube shaft. Each resulting wedge of
floor is a different bright color, each is given over to a different
amusement: a swimming pool, a bandstand, a zero-g dance-plate,
carnival rides, a shimmer maze. Noise rises. Music plays.</P>
<P>Across from you sits the Wanderer, wearing
dirtdigger green and an expression of bitter contempt. &quot;Look at
them,&quot; he says. 'We're about to approach another planet, and
they don't even know where they are.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And where is that, Refugee?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Who should know better than you, Dutchman?&quot;
he says. And the people below turn transparent, and the bulkheads
disappear, and you are watching zombies dancing on a platform
floating in the interstellar abyss. Nothing else lives, nothing else
moves, in all that endless immensity.</P>
<P>Manic laughter tickles your throat.</P>
<P>A planet appears as a pinpoint, then a
green-and-brown mottled sphere with fleecy white clouds, and then you
are standing on its surface among a party of suited men trudging
heavily back to their shuttleship. Hard brown rock veined with
greenish mineral streakings under a blue-black sky dotted with
pastel-green clouds. You are back on your balcony watching specters
dance in the endless galactic night.</P>
<P>&quot;Great admiral, what shall you say when hope
is gone?&quot; the Wanderer says.</P>
<P>And you are down among the specters, grown ten
feet tall, a giant shaking your fist against the blackness, at the
dead planet, howling your defiance against the everlasting night.
&quot;Sail on! Sail on! Sail on and on!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No more ships! No more ships! Soil or
death!&quot; You are marching at the head of a small army of men and
women in dirtdigger green as it bursts into the amusement deck from
the deck below, bearing crosses wrapped with simmed grape leaves.
Each chanted shout sends nails through your wrists.</P>
<P>And you are leading your carnival of ghosts on a
mad dance through a dirtdigger deck, carelessly trampling on the
fragile life-forms, strewing gold and silver confetti, flashers,
handfuls of jewels&mdash;the bounty of the fusion torch's passage
through the interstellar plankton.</P>
<P>You are in a droptube falling through the decks of
a ship. Amusement decks, residential decks, manufacturing decks,
sifting decks&mdash;all but the control and torchtender decks&mdash;have
been rudely covered over with synthetic loam and turned into
makeshift dirtdigger decks. The growth is sparse, the air has a
chemical foulness, metal surfaces are beginning to corrode, and the
green-clad people have the hunched shoulders and sunken eyes of the
unwholesomely obsessed. The vine-covered cross is everywhere.</P>
<P>You are rising through a lift-tube on another
ship. Here the machinery is in good repair, the air is clean, the
bulkheads shiny, and the decks of the ship glory in light and sound
and surfaces of simmed ruby, emerald, sapphire, and diamond. The
people are birds-of-paradise in mirrorsuits, simmed velvets and silks
in luxurious shades and patterns, feathers and leathers, gold,
silver, and brass. But they seem to be moving to an unnatural rhythm,
dancing a mad jig to a phantom fiddler, and their flesh is as
transparent as unpolarized plex.</P>
<P>You are floating in space in the center of the
Trek; behind you, the Trekborn ships are a half-circle diadem of
jeweled brilliance. In front of you floats the Wanderer, and behind
him the old converted asteroid freighters, tacky and decayed, pale
greenery showing behind every blister and viewport.</P>
<P>&quot;Your gardens are dying, Wanderer.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yours never had life, Dutchman,&quot; he
says, and you can see stars and void through your glassy flesh,
through the ghost-ships behind you.</P>
<P>Two silvery headbands appear in the space between
you in a fanfare of music and a golden halo of light. Large, crude,
designed for temporary external wear, they are the first full sensory
transceivers, ancestors of the surgically implanted tap. They glow
and pulse like live things, like the gift of the nonexistent gods.</P>
<P>You pick one of the headbands, laugh, place it on
the Wanderer's head. &quot;With this ring, I thee wed.&quot;</P>
<P>Unblinkingly, he places the other band on yours.
&quot;Bear my crown of thorns,&quot; he says.</P>
<P>You stand on the bridge of a torchship, the
spectral Dutchman at your side. Beyond the plex, the stars are a
million live jewels, a glory mirrored in the lights of the Trek.</P>
<P>You kneel among tiny pine trees in a dirtdigger
deck beside the Wanderer, and they become a redwood forest towering
into the blue skies of lost Earth, and you can feel the pain of the
nails in your ghostly wrists, hearing the tolling of a far-off bell,
feel the body's sadness, smell the incense of irredeemable loss.</P>
<P>You rise through a lift-tube, the Dutchman's hand
in yours, and you hear the hum of energy as you pass through deck
after jeweled and gleaming deck, hear the sounds of human laughter
and joy, see crystal trees sprouting and rising from the metal
deckplates. The flesh of the spectral people solidifies and the
Dutchman's hand becomes pink and solid. When you look at his face,
your own Wanderer's eyes look back, pain muted by a wild joy.</P>
<P>You float in the center of the Trek with the
Wanderer as the ships around you rearrange themselves in an intricate
ballet: Trekborn and converted asteroid freighters in hundreds of
magical <I>pas de deux, </I>reintegrating the Trek.</P>
<P>You are droptubing down through the decks of a
dirtdigger ship, watching green uniforms transform themselves into
the bird-of-paradise plumage of the Trekborn ships, watching the
corrosion disappear from the metal, watching crystal gazebos, shimmer
mazes, and bubbling brooks appear, as shrines to sadness become
gardens of joy.</P>
<P>And you are sitting across a round simmed marble
table from the Dutchman on a balcony cafe halfway up the bulkhead of
an amusement deck. The central torchtube shaft is overgrown with ivy.
The pool, bandstand, shimmer mazes, dance-plates, and carnival rides
are laid out in a meadow of green grass shaded by pines and oaks. The
bulkheads and upper decking dissolve, and this garden square stands
revealed as a tiny circle of life lost in the immensity of the
eternal void.</P>
<P>&quot;We're Wanderers in the midnight of the
soul,&quot; the Dutchman says. &quot;Perhaps we're guardians of the
only living things that ever were,&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Flying Dutchmen on an endless sea, perhaps
the only gods there be.&quot;</P>
<P>And you are a detached viewpoint watching this
circle of life drift away into the immensity of space, watching the
Trek dwindle away until it is nothing more than one more abstract
pinpoint of light against the galactic darkness. Words of pale fire
appear across the endless star-field:</P>

</P>
<H5>WANDERING DUTCHMEN 
</H5>
<H5>by Jofe D'mahl</H5>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>There was an unmistakable note of politeness in
the clicking of tongues in Jofe D'mahl's grand salon. The applause
went on for an appropriate interval (<I>just </I>appropriate), and
then the guests were up and talking, a brightly colored flock of
birds flitting and jabbering about the jeweled forest.</P>
<P>&quot;. . . you could see that it had well-defined
continents, and the green areas <I>must </I>be vegetation . . .&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;. . . oxygen, sure, but can we breathe all
that helium?&quot;</P>
<P>Standing between Jiz Rumoku and Bandoora, Jofe
D'mahl found himself in the infuriating position of being a vacuum
beside the focus of attention. Eyes constantly glanced in their
direction for a glimpse of Bandoora, but no gaze dared linger long,
for at the side of the void-sucker, D'mahl was sizzling toward nova,
his eyes putting out enough hard radiation to melt plex.</P>
<P>But Bandoora himself was looking straight at him,
and D'mahl sensed some unguessable focus of alien warmth pulsing up
at him from the depths of those unfathomable eyes. &quot;I'm sorry
the Pilots' bulletin ruined your premiere,&quot; he said.</P>
<P><I>&quot;Really?&quot; </I>D'mahl snarled. &quot;What
makes you think your precious blatt has so much importance?&quot; he
continued loudly. There was no reason for the guests not to stare
now; D'mahl was shouting for it. &quot;You dreeks expect us to slaver
like Pavlov's dogs every time you turn up some reeking mudball that
looks habitable until you get close enough to get a good whiff of the
dead stink of poison gas and naked rock. Your blatt will be a
six-month nova, Bandoora. Art is forever.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Forever may be a longer time than you
realize, D'mahl,&quot; Bandoora said calmly. &quot;Other than that, I
agree with you entirely. I found <I>Wandering Dutchmen </I>quite
moving.&quot; Were those actually <I>tears </I>forming in his eyes?
&quot;Perhaps more moving than even you can imagine.&quot;</P>
<P>Silence reigned now as the attention of the guests
become totally focused on this small psychodrama. Some of the bolder
ones began to inch closer. D'mahl found that he could not make out
Bandoora's vector; in this little ego contest, there seemed to be no
common set of rules.</P>
<P>&quot;I'd like to atone for interfering with the
premiere of a great work of art,&quot; Bandoora said. &quot;I'll give
you a chance to make the greatest senso of your career, D'mahl.&quot;
There was a thin smile on his lips, but his eyes were so earnest as
to appear almost comical.</P>
<P>&quot;What makes you think <I>you </I>can teach <I>me
</I>anything about senses?&quot; D'mahl said. &quot;Next thing,
you'll be asking me for a lesson in voidsucking.&quot; A titter of
laughter danced around the salon.</P>
<P>&quot;Perhaps I've already gotten it, D'mahl,&quot;
Bandoora said. He turned, began walking through the colored mists and
crystal trees toward the transparent plex that blistered the great
balcony, focusing his eyes on D'mahl through the crowd, back over his
shoulder. &quot;I don't know anything about sensos, but I can show
you a reality that will make anything you've experienced pale into
nothingness. Capture it on tape if you dare.&quot; A massed intake of
breath.</P>
<P><I>&quot;If 1 dare!&quot; </I>D'mahl shouted,
exploding into nova. &quot;Who do you think you're scaring with your
cheap theatrics, Bandoora? I'm Jofe D'mahl, I'm the greatest artist
of my time, I'm riding the torch of my own ego, and I know it. <I>If
I dare! </I>What do you think any of us have to do <I>but </I>dare,
you poor dreek? Didn't you understand <I>anything </I>of what you
just experienced?&quot;</P>
<P>Bandoora reached the plex blister, turned, stood
outlined against the starry darkness, the blaze of the concourse of
ships. His eyes seemed to draw a baleful energy from the blackness.
&quot;No theatrics, D'mahl,&quot; Bandoora said. &quot;No computer
taps, no sensos, no illusions. None of the things all you people live
by. <I>Reality, </I>D'mahl, the real thing. Out there. The naked
void.&quot;</P>
<P>He half turned, stretched out his right arm as if
to embrace the darkness. &quot;Come with us on Bela-37, D'mahl,&quot;
he said. &quot;Out there in your naked mind where nothing exists but
you and the everlasting void. <I>Wandering Dutchmen </I>speaks well
of such things&mdash;for a senso by a man who was simming it. What
might you do with your own sensorium tape of the void itself&mdash;if
you dared record it through your own living flesh? Do you dare,
D'mahl, do you dare face the truth of it with your naked soul?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Jof<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&mdash;</FONT>&quot;</P>
<P>D'mahl brushed Jiz aside. <I>&quot;Simming it!&quot;
</I>he bellowed in red rage. &quot;Do I dare!&quot; The reality of
the grand salon, even the ego challenge hurled at him before his
guests, burned away in the white-hot fire of the deeper challenge,
the gauntlet Bandoora had flung at the feet of his soul. <I>I</I> <I>can
face this thing, can you? Can you truly carve living art out of the
dead void, not metaphorically, but out of the nothingness itself, in
the flesh, in realtime? Or are you simming it? Are you a fraud?</I></P>
<P>&quot;I told you, Bandoora,&quot; he said, hissing
through his rage, &quot;I've got nothing to do <I>but </I>dare.&quot;</P>
<P>The guests oohed, Jiz shook her head, Bandoora
nodded and smiled. Jofe D'mahl felt waves of change ripple through
his grand salon, through himself, but their nature and vector eluded
the grasp of his mind.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3>II</H3>
<P>As he flitted from <I>Excelsior </I>to <I>Brigadoon
</I>across a crowded sector of the central Trek, it seemed to Jofe
D'mahl that the bubble of excitement in which he had been moving
since the premiere party had more tangibility than the transparent
shimmer screen of his voidbubble. The shimmer was visible only as the
interface between the hard vacuum of space and the sphere of air it
contained, but the enhancement of his persona was visible on the face
of every person he saw. He was being tapped so frequently by people
he had never met in senso or flesh that he had finally had to do
something 180&deg; from his normal vector: tap a screening program
into his banks that rejected calls from all people not on a
manageable approved list. He was definitely the Trek's current nova.</P>
<P>Even here, among the bubbled throngs flitting from
ship to ship or just space-jaunting, D'mahl felt as if he were
outshining the brilliance of the concourse of torchships, even the
hydrogen interface itself, as most of the people whose trajectories
came within visible range of his own saluted him with nods of their
heads or subtle sidelong glances.</P>
<P>It almost made up for the fact that it wasn't
<I>Wandering Dutchmen </I>that had triggered his nova but his public
decision to dare six standard months with the voidsuckers&mdash;away
from the Trek, out of tap contact with the banks, alone in his mind
and body like a primitive pre-tap man. Waller Nan Pei had achieved
the same effect by announcing his public suicide a month in advance,
but blew out his torch forever by failing to go through with it.
D'mahl knew there could be no backing out now.</P>
<P>He flitted past <I>Paradisio, </I>accepted the
salutations of the passengers on a passing shuttle, rounded <I>Ginza,
</I>throttled back his g-polarizer, and landed lightly on his toes on
<I>Brigadoon's </I>main entrance stage. He walked quickly across the
ruby ledge, passed through the shimmer, collapsed his bubble, and
took the nearest droptube for Jiz Rumoku's gallery on twelvedeck,
wondering what the place would look like this time.</P>
<P>Thanks to Jiz's aura, <I>Brigadoon </I>was the
chameleon-ship of the Trek; whole decks were completely done over
about as often as the average Trekker redid his private quarters.
Fashions and flashes tended to spread from <I>Brigadoon </I>to the
rest of the Trek much as they spread from Jiz's gallery to the declcs
of her ship. Recently, a motion to change the ship's name to
<I>Quicksilver </I>had come within fifty votes of passage.</P>
<P>Dropping through the decks, D'mahl saw more
changes than he could identify without tapping for the previous
layouts, and he had been on <I>Brigadoon </I>about a standard month
ago. Threedeck had been living quarters tiered around a formalized
rock garden; now it was a lagoon with floating houseboats. Sixdeck
had been a sim of the ancient Tivoli; now the amusements were
arranged on multileveled g-plates over a huge slow-motion whirlpool
of syrupy rainbow-colored liquid. Nine-deck had been a ziggurat-maze
of living quarters festooned with ivy; now it was a miniature desert
of static-molded gold and silver dust-dunes, latticed into a faerie
filigree of cavelike apartments. Fluidity seemed to be the theme of
the month.</P>
<P>Twelvedeck was now a confection of multicolored
energy. The walls of the shops and restaurants were tinted shimmer
screens in scores of subtle hues, and the central plaza around the
torchtube shaft was an ever-changing meadow of slowly-moving
miniature fuzzballs in blue, green, purple, yellow, and magenta. The
torchtube itself was a cylindrical mirror, and most of the people
were wearing tinted mirror-suits, fogrobes, or lightcloaks. It was
like being inside a rainbow, and D'mahl felt out of sync in his
comparatively severe blue pants, bare chest, and cloth-of-gold cloak.</P>
<P>Jiz Rumoku's gallery was behind a sapphire-blue
waterfall that cascaded from halfway up the curved bulkhead to a pool
of mist spilling out across the floor of the deck. D'mahl stepped
through it, half expecting to be soaked. Mercifully, the waterfall
proved to be a holo, but with Jiz, you never knew.</P>
<P>&quot;You who are about to die salute us,&quot;
Jiz said. She was lying in a blushing-pink fuzzball, naked except for
blinding auroras of broad-spectrum light coyly hiding her breasts and
loins. The pink fuzzball floated in a lazy ellipse near the center of
the gallery, which was now a circular area contained by a shimmer
screen around its circumference that rippled endless spectral
changes. The ceiling was a holo of roiling orange fire, the floor a
mirror of some soft substance.</P>
<P>&quot;Better in fire than in ice,&quot; D'mahl
said. &quot;My motto.&quot; They cross-tapped, and D'mahl lay in the
fuzzball feeling an electric glow as his body walked across the
gallery and kissed Jiz's lips.</P>
<P>&quot;Voidsucking isn't exactly my idea of fire,
Jof,&quot; Jiz said as they simultaneously broke their taps.</P>
<P>&quot;This is?&quot; D'mahl said, sweeping his arm
in an arc. Dozens of floaters in sizes ranging from a few square
centimeters to a good three meters square drifted in seemingly random
trajectories around the gallery, displaying objects and
energy-effects ranging from tiny pieces of static-molded gemdust
jewelry to boxes of flashers, fogrobes, clingers, holo-panes that
were mostly abstract, and several large and very striking
fire-sculptures. The floaters themselves were all transparent plex,
and very few of the &quot;objects&quot; on them were pure matter.</P>
<P>&quot;I cog that people are going to be bored with
matter for a while,&quot; Jiz said, rising from the fuzzball. &quot;After
all, it's nothing but frozen energy. Flux is the coming nova,
energy-matter interface stuff. It expresses the spirit of the torch,
don't you think? Energy, protons, electrons, neutrons, and heavy
element dust from the interstellar medium .transmuted into whatever
we please. This current collection expresses the transmuta-tional
state itself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I like to have a few things with hard
surfaces around,&quot; D'mahl said somewhat dubiously.</P>
<P>&quot;You'll see, even your place will be
primarily interface for the next standard month or so. You'll put it
in sync.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No I won't, oh creator of tomorrow's flash,&quot;
D'mahl said, kissing her teasingly on the lips. &quot;While everyone
else is going transmutational, I'll be out there in the cold hard
void, where energy and matter know their places and stick to them.&quot;</P>
<P>Jiz frowned, touched his cheek. &quot;You're
really going through with it, aren't you?&quot; she said. &quot;Months
of being cooped up in some awful scout-ship, sans tap, sans lovers,
sans change. . . .&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Perhaps at least not sans lovers,&quot;
D'mahl said lightly, thinking of Sidi. But Jiz, he saw, was seriously
worried. &quot;What's the matter, Jiz?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do you actually know about the
voidsuckers?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What's to know? They man the scoutships.
They look for habitable planets. They live the simplest lives
imaginable.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Have you tapped anything on them?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No. I'm taking a senso recorder along, of
course, and I'll have to use myself as major viewpoint, so I don't
want any sensory preconceptions.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I've tapped the basic sensohistory of the
voidsuckers, Jof. There's nothing else in the banks. Doesn't that
bother you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Should it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Tap it, Jof.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I told you<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&mdash;</FONT>&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I know, no sensory preconceptions. But I'm
asking you to tap it anyway. I have, and I think you should.&quot;
Her eyes were hard and unblinking, and her mouth was hardened into an
ideogram of resolve. When Jiz got that look, D'mahl usually found it
advisable to follow her vector, for the sake of parsimony, if nothing
else.</P>
<P>&quot;All right,&quot; he said. &quot;For you,
I'll sully my pristine consciousness with sordid facts. Voidsuckers,
basic history,&quot; he subvoced.</P>
<P>He stood in an observation blister watching a
scoutship head for the hydrogen interface. The scout was basically a
torchship-size fusion tube with a single small toroid deck amidship
and a bridge bubble up near the intake. &quot;Trek Year 301,&quot; a
neuter voice said. &quot;The first scout-ship is launched by the
Trek. Crewed by five volunteers, it is powered by a full-size fusion
torch though its mass is only one tenth that of a conventional
torchship. Combined with its utilization of the Trek's momentum, this
enables it rapidly to reach a terminal velocity approaching .87
lights.&quot;</P>
<P>D'mahl was a detached observer far out in space
watching the scout-ship torch ahead of the Trek. Another scoutship,
then another, and another, and finally others too numerous to count
easily, torched through the hydrogen interface and ahead of the Trek,
veering off at angles ranging from ten to thirty degrees, forming a
conical formation. The area of space enclosed by the cone turned
bright green as the voice said: &quot;By 402, the scoutships numbered
forty-seven, and the still-current search pattern had been
regularized. Ranging up to a full light-year from the Trek and
remote-surveying solar systems from this expanded cone of vision, the
scoutship system maximized the number of potential habitable planets
surveyed in a given unit of time.&quot;</P>
<P>Now D'mahl sat on the bridge of a scoutship
looking out the plex at space. Around him, two men and a woman in
blue voidsucker shorts were puttering about with instrument consoles.
&quot;In 508, a new innovation was introduced.&quot; A small drone
missile shot slightly ahead of the scoutship, which then began to
veer off. &quot;Scoutships now dispatched telltale probes to
potentially habitable planets, returning at once to the Trek.&quot;</P>
<P>D'mahl was a viewpoint in space watching a
stylized diorama of the Trek, a scoutship, a telltale, and a solar
system. The scout was torching back to the Trek while the telltale
orbited a planet, broadcasting a red wavefront of information
Trekward. The scout reached the Trek, which altered its vector toward
the telltale's solar system. The scout then left the Trek to monitor
the oncoming telltale wavefront. &quot;By turning the Trek toward a
prospective system, then returning to monitor the telltale wavefront
by scoutship, our fully evolved planetary reconnaissance system now
maximizes the number of solar systems investigated in a given time
period and also minimizes the reporting time for each
high-probability solar system investigated.&quot;</P>
<P>D'mahl was aboard a scoutship, playing null-g
tennis with an attractive female voidsucker. He was in a simple
commissary punching out a meal. He was lying on a grav-plate set at
about .25 g in small private sleeping quarters. He was a female
voidsucker making love to a tall powerful man in null-g. &quot;The
scout's quarters, though comfortable and adequate to maintain
physical and mental health, impose some hardship on the crew owing to
space limitations,&quot; the neuter voice said. &quot;Tap banks are
very limited and access to the central Trek banks impossible. Scout
crews must content themselves with simple in-flesh amusements. All
Trekkers owe these selfless volunteers a debt of gratitude.&quot;</P>
<P>Jofe D'mahl looked into Jiz Rumoku's eyes. He
shrugged. &quot;So?&quot; he said. &quot;What does that tell me that
I didn't already know?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing, Jof, not one damned thing! The
voidsuckers have been out there in the flesh for over half a
millennium, spending most of their lives with no tap connection to
the Trek, to everything that makes the only human civilization there
is what it is. What's their karmic vector? What's inside their
skulls? Why are they called voidsuckers, anyway? Why isn't there
anything in the banks except that basic history tape?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Obviously because no one's gone out there
with them to make a real senso,&quot; D'mahl said. &quot;They're
certainly not the types to produce one themselves. That's why I'm
going, Jiz. I think Bandoora was right&mdash; there's a beyond senso
to be made on the voidsuckers, and it may be the only virgin subject
matter left.&quot;</P>
<P>A little of the intensity went out of Jiz's
expression. &quot;Ego, of course, has nothing to do with it,&quot;
she said.</P>
<P>&quot;Ego, of course, has everything to do with
it,&quot; D'mahl replied.</P>
<P>She touched a hand to his cheek. &quot;Be careful,
Jof,&quot; she said quite softly.</P>
<P>Moved, D'mahl put his hand over hers, kissed her
lightly on the lips, feeling, somehow, like an Earthbound primitive.
&quot;What's there to be afraid of?&quot; he said with equal
tenderness.</P>
<P>&quot;I don't know, Jof, and I don't know how to
find out. That's what scares me.&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Jofe D'mahl felt <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">a</SPAN><I>
</I>rising sense of vectorless anticipation as the shuttle bore him
bow-ward toward Bela-37, a silvery cylinder glinting against the
auroral background of the hydrogen interface as it hung like a
Damoclean sword above him. Below, the ships of the Trek were
receding, becoming first a horizon-filling landscape of light and
flash, then a disk of human warmth sharply outlined against the cold
black night. It occurred to him that Trekkers seldom ventured up here
where the scoutships parked, close by the interface separating the
Trek from the true void. It was not hard to see why.</P>
<P>&quot;Long way up, isn't it?&quot; he muttered.</P>
<P>The shuttle pilot nodded. &quot;Not many people
come up here,&quot; he said. &quot;Voidsuckers and maintenance crews
mostly. I come up here by myself sometimes to feel the pressure of
the void behind the interface and look down on it all like a god on
Olympus.&quot; He laughed dryly. &quot;Maybe I've ferried one
voidsucker too many.&quot;</P>
<P>Something made D'mahl shudder, then yearn for the
communion of the tap&mdash;the overwhelmingly rich intermeshing of
time, space, bodies, and realities from which he was about to isolate
himself for the first time in his life. The tap is what we live by,
he thought, and who so more than I?</P>
<P>&quot;Jiz Rumoku,&quot; he subvoced, and he was in
her body, standing beside a fire-sculpture in her gallery with a
chunky black man in <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">a</SPAN><I>
</I>severe green velvet suit. &quot;Hello, Jiz,&quot; he said with
her vocal cords. &quot;Hello and good-bye.&quot;</P>
<P>He withdrew his tap from her body, and she
followed into his, high above the Trek. &quot;Hello, Jof. It's sure a
long way up.&quot; She kissed his hand with his lips. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Take care,&quot; his voice said. Then she
broke the tap, and D'mahl was alone in his flesh as the shuttle
decelerated, easing up alongside Bela-37's toroid main deck.</P>
<P>&quot;This is it,&quot; the shuttle pilot said.
&quot;You board through the main shimmer.&quot; D'mahl gave the pilot
an ironic salute, erected his voidbubble, grabbed his kit and senso
recorder, and flitted across a few meters of space to Bela-37's main
entrance stage.</P>
<P>Stepping through the shimmer, he was surprised to
find himself in a small closetlike room with no droptube shaft in
evidence. A round door in the far bulkhead opened and a tall, pale
voidsucker stepped inside. &quot;I'm Ban Nyborg, D'mahl,&quot; he
said. He laughed rather humorlessly. &quot;This is an airlock,&quot;
he said. &quot;Safety feature.&quot;</P>
<P>Automatically, D'mahl tapped for a definition of
the new word: <I>double-doored chamber designed to facilitate ship
entry and exit, obsoleted by the shimmer screen. </I>&quot;How
quaint,&quot; he said, following Nyborg through the open door.</P>
<P>&quot;Lose power, lose your shimmer, this way you
keep your air,&quot; Nyborg said, leading D'mahl down a dismal blue
pastel corridor. &quot;Radial passageway,&quot; Nyborg said. &quot;Leads
to circular corridor around the torchtube. Five other radials, tubes
to the bridge and back, that's the ship.&quot; They reached the
circumtorchtube corridor, done in washed-out blue and yellow, walked
60 degrees around it past some instrument consoles and an orange
radial corridor, then another 60 degrees and halfway up a green
radial to a plain matter door.</P>
<P>Nyborg opened the door and D'mahl stepped into a
grim little room. There was a g-plate, a blue pneumatic chair, a tall
simmed walnut chest, a shaggy red rug, and beyond an open door,
toilet facilities. The ceiling was deep gray, and three of the walls
were grayish tan. The fourth was a holo of the interstellar abyss
itself&mdash;pinpoint stars and yawning blackness&mdash;and it faced
the g-plate.</P>
<P>&quot;Bandoora's quarters,&quot; Nyborg said.
&quot;He's doubling with Sidi.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Charming,&quot; D'mahl grunted. &quot;I'm
touched.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ship's got three tap frequencies: library,
communications, external visual. Bridge is off limits now. You can
tap our departure on external.&quot; Nyborg turned, walked
unceremoniously out of the little cell, and closed the door behind
him.</P>
<P>D'mahl shuddered. The walls and ceiling seemed to
be closing in on him as if to squeeze him into the reality of the
holo. He found himself staring into the starfield, leaning toward it
as if it were pulling him down into it.</P>
<P>He blinked, feeling the strangeness of the
sensation, which drew his attention away from the holo and to his
senso recorder. Ought to get all this down. He turned the recorder
on, dropped in a hundred-hour pod of microtape, keyed it to his own
sensorium. But the initial moment of vertigo had passed; now he was
just in an excruciatingly dull little room with a big starfield holo
on one wall.</P>
<P>D'mahl set the g-plate for one tenth g, just
enough to hold him in place, and lay down on the padding. He found
himself staring into the starfield holo again from this position. Did
Bandoora actually like being sucked at by that thing?</P>
<P>Bandoora tapped him, audio only: &quot;Welcome to
Bela-37, D'mahl. We're about to torch through the interface. Perhaps
you'd care to tap it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thanks,&quot; D'mahl tapped back through the
scout's com frequency, &quot;but I'd rather record it in the flesh
from the bridge.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sorry, but the bridge is off limits to you
now,&quot; Bandoora said, and broke the tap.</P>
<P>&quot;Drool!&quot; D'mahl snarled to no one, and
irritably tapped the scout's external visual frequency.</P>
<P>He was a disembodied viewpoint moving through the
silent friction-less darkness of space. It was like being in a
voidbubble and yet not like being in a voidbubble, for here he was
disconnected from all internal and external senses save vision. He
found that he could tap sub-frequencies that gave him choice of
visual direction, something like being able to turn his nonexistent
head. Below, the Trek was a jewel of infinitely subtle light slowly
shrinking in the velvet blackness. All other vectors were dominated
by the hydrogen interface, a sky of rainbow brilliance that seemed to
all but surround him.</P>
<P>It was a moving visual spectacle, and yet the lack
of the subtleties of full senso also made it pathetic, filled D'mahl
with an elusive sadness. As the rainbow sheen of the hydrogen
interface moved visibly closer, that sadness resolved along a
nostalgia vector as D'mahl realized that he was about to lose tap
contact with the Trek's banks. The interface energies would block out
the banks long before time-lag or signal attenuation even became <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">a</SPAN><I>
</I>factor. It was his last chance to say good-bye to the multiplex
Trek reality before being committed to the unknown and invariant void
beyond.</P>
<P>He broke his tap with the scout's visual
frequency, and zip-tapped through the multiplicity of the Trek's
frequencies like a dying man flashing through his life's sensorium
track before committing it to the limbo banks.</P>
<P>He stood among the crystal trees of his own grand
salon. He was Dalta Reed punting across Blood Lake on <I>Lothlorien
</I>and he was Erna Ramblieu making love to John Benina on his
balcony overlooking Sundance Corridor on <I>Magic Mountain. </I>He
watched <I>Excelsior </I>being built from the body of a welder
working on the hull, and he flashed through the final sequence of
<I>Wandering Dutchmen. </I>He riffled through his own sensorium
track&mdash;making love to Jiz five years ago in a dirtdigger deck,
moments of ten parties, dancing above a null-g plate as a boy,
cutting <I>Wandering Dutchmen </I>at his editor&mdash;realizing
suddenly that he was leaving the world of his own stored memories
behind with everything else. Finally, he flashed through Jiz Rumoku's
body as she led the man in the green velvet suit past a holoframe of
the Far Look Ballet dancing <I>Swan Lake </I>in null-g, and then his
tap was broken, and he was lying on his g-plate in Bela-37, unable to
reestablish it.</P>
<P>He tapped the scout's visual frequency and found
himself moving into the world-filling brilliance of the hydrogen
interface behind the auroral bubble of Bela-37's own torch intake
field. The lesser rainbow touched the greater, and D'mahl rapidly
became sheathed in glory as Bela-37's field formed a bulge in the
Trek's combined field, a bulge that enveloped the scoutship and
D'mahl, became a closed sphere of full-spectrum fire for an instant,
then burst through the hydrogen interface with a rush that sent
D'mahl's being soaring, gasping, and reeling into the cold hard
blackness of the open void beyond.</P>
<P>D'mahl shook, grunted, and broke the tap. For a
panicked moment he thought he had somehow been trapped in the abyss
as his vision snapped back into his flesh staring at the holo of the
void that filled the wall facing him.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The lift-tube ended and Jofe D'mahl floated up out
of it and onto the circular bridge of Bela-37-. The bridge was a plex
blister up near the bow of the torchtube encircled by consoles and
controls to waist level but otherwise visually naked to the
interstellar void. Bow-ward, the ship's intake field formed a
miniature hydrogen interface; stern-ward, the Trek was visible as a
scintillating disk behind a curtain of ethereal fire, but otherwise
nothing seemed to live or move in all that eternal immensity.</P>
<P>&quot;Isn't there any getting away from it?&quot;
D'mahl muttered, half to himself, half to Haris Bandoora, who had
watched him emerge from the lift-tube with those unfathomable eyes
and an ironic, enigmatic grin.</P>
<P>&quot;You people spend your lives trying to get
away from it,&quot; Bandoora said, &quot;and we spend our lives
drenching ourselves in it because we know there <I>is </I>no real
escape from it. One way or the other, our lives are dominated by the
void.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Speak for yourself, Bandoora,&quot; D'mahl
said. &quot;Out there is only one reality.&quot; He touched a
forefinger to his temple. &quot;In here are an infinity more.</P>
<P>&quot;Illusion,&quot; said a woman's voice behind
him. D'mahl turned and saw Sidi&mdash;conical bare breasts, hairless
silvered skull, tightly muscled body, opaque voidsucker eyes&mdash;a
vision of cold and abstract feminine beauty.</P>
<P>D'mahl smiled at her. &quot;What is,&quot; he
said, &quot;is real.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Where you come from,&quot; Sidi said, &quot;no
one knows what's real.&quot;</P>
<P><I>&quot;R<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&eacute;</FONT>alit<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&eacute;</FONT>
c'est moi,&quot; </I>D'mahl said in ancient French. When both Sidi
and Bandoora stared at him blankly, failing to tap for the reference,
<I>unable </I>to tap for the reference, he had a sharp flash of
loneliness. An adult among children. A civilized man among
primitives. And out there . . . out there . . .</P>
<P>He forced his attention away from such thoughts,
forced his vision away from the all-enveloping void, and walked
toward one of the instrument consoles where a slim woman with a
shaven untinted skull sat in a pedestal chair adjusting some
controls.</P>
<P>&quot;This is Areth Lorenzi,&quot; Bandoora said.
&quot;She's setting the sweep-sequence of our extreme-range gravscan.
We automatically scan a twenty light-year sphere for new planeted
stars even on a mission like this. We can pick up an Earth-massed
body that far away.&quot;</P>
<P>The woman turned, and D'mahl saw a face steeped in
age. There were wrinkles around her eyes, at the corners of her
mouth, even a hint of them on her cheeks; extraordinary enough in
itself, but it was her deep, deep pale-blue eyes that spoke most
eloquently of her years, of the sheer volume of the things they had
seen.</P>
<P>&quot;How often have you detected such bodies?&quot;
D'mahl asked conversationally, to keep from obviously staring.</P>
<P>Something seemed to flare in those limpid depths.
She glanced over D'mahl's shoulder at Bandoora for a moment. &quot;It's
... a common enough occurrence,&quot; she said, and turned back to
her work.</P>
<P>&quot;And finally, this is Raj Doru,&quot;
Bandoora said with a peculiar hastiness, indicating the other
voidsucker on the bridge: a squat, dark, powerful-looking man with a
fierce mouth, a sweeping curve of a nose, and bright brown eyes
glowering under his shaven brows. He was standing, hands on hips,
regarding D'mahl scornfully.</P>
<P><I>&quot;What is, is real,&quot; </I>Doru said
acidly. &quot;What do you know about real, Jofe D'mahl? You've never
confronted the reality of the universe in your whole life! Cowering
behind your hydrogen interface and your tap and your mental
masturbation fantasies! The void would shrivel your soul to a
pinpoint and then snuff it out of existence.&quot;</P>
<P><I>&quot;Raj!&quot; </I>Bandoora snapped. Psychic
energy crackled and clashed as the two voidsuckers glared at each
other for a silent moment.</P>
<P>&quot;Let's see the great D'mahl suck some void,
Haris, let's&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Everything in its time,&quot; Bandoora said.
&quot;This isn't it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Raj is an impatient man,&quot; Sidi said.</P>
<P>&quot;A peculiar trait for a voidsucker,&quot;
D'mahl replied dryly. These people were beginning to grate on his
consciousness. They seemed humorless, obsessive, out of sync with
their own cores, as if the nothingness in which they continuously and
monomaniacally wallowed had emptied out their centers and filled them
with itself.</P>
<P>D'mahl found himself looking up and out into the
starry blackness of the abyss, wondering if that eternal coldness
might in time seep into his core too, if the mind simply could not
encompass that much nothingness and still remain in command of its
own vector.</P>
<P>&quot;Patience is an indifferent virtue out here,&quot;
Areth said. It did not seem a comforting thought.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3>III</H3>
<P>What do these people <I>do </I>with themselves?
Jofe D'mahl wondered as he paced idly and nervously around the
circumtorchtube corridor for what seemed like the thousandth time. A
week aboard Bela-37 and he was woozy with boredom. There was a limit
to how much chess and null-g tennis you could play, and the ship's
library banks were pathetic&mdash;a few hundred standard reference
tapes, fifty lamer pornos, a hundred classic sensos (four of his own
included, he was wanly pleased to note), and an endless log of
dull-as-death scoutship reports.</P>
<P>&quot;Patience is an indifferent virtue out here,&quot;
Areth Lorenzi had said. To D'mahl, it seemed the only virtue possible
under the circumstances, and his supply of it was rapidly running
out.</P>
<P>Up ahead, he heard footfalls coming down a radial
corridor, and a moment later his vector intersected that of Sidi,
striding beautifully and coldly toward him like a robot simmed in
flesh. Even his initial attraction to her was beginning to fade.
Inside that carapace of abstract beauty she seemed as disconnected
from any reality he cared to share as the others.</P>
<P>&quot;Hello, D'mahl,&quot; she said distantly.
&quot;Have you been getting good material for your senso?&quot;</P>
<P>D'mahl snorted. &quot;If you can call a pod and a
quarter of boredom footage interesting material,&quot; he said.
&quot;Bandoora promised me something transcendent. Where is it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Have you not looked around you?&quot;</P>
<P>D'mahl nodded upward, at the ceiling, at space
beyond. &quot;Out there? I can see that from my own grand salon.&quot;</P>
<P>'Wait.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;For what?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;For the call.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What call?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;When it comes, you will know it,&quot; Sidi
said, and walked past him up the corridor. D'mahl shook his head.
From Doru, hostility; from Bandoora, lamer metaphysics; from Nyborg,
a grunt now and then; from Areth Lorenzi, a few games of nearly
silent chess. Now brain-teases from Sidi. Can it be that that's all
these people have? A few lamer quirks around a core of inner vacuum?
Nothing but their own obsessiveness between them and eternal boredom?
It might make a reasonably interesting senso, if I could figure out a
way to dramatize vacuity. He sighed. At least it gave him a valid
artistic problem to play with.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">&quot;All</SPAN><I>
</I>routine here,&quot; Ban Nyborg said, bending his tall frame over
the readout screen, across which two columns of letters and numbers
slowly crawled. &quot;Star catalog numbers on the left, masses of any
dark bodies around them on the right.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A simple program could monitor this,&quot;
D'mahl said. &ldquo;Why are you doing it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Computer <I>does </I>screen it, I'm just
backing up. Something to do.&quot;</P>
<P>D'mahl shook his head. He had wandered into this
comp center by accident &mdash; none of the voidsuckers  had even
bothered to mention it to him. Yet here was much of the equipment at
the heart of the scoutship's mission: the ship's computer and banks,
the gravscan readout, and a whole series of other instrument consoles
he would have had to tap for to identify. But the dull gray room had
a strange air of neglect about it.</P>
<P>&quot;You sound almost as bored as I am, Nyborg,&quot;
he said.</P>
<P>Nyborg nodded without looking up. &quot;All
waiting, till you get the call.&quot;</P>
<P><I>&quot;The call? </I>What call?&quot;</P>
<P>Nyborg turned, and for the first time in nearly
two standard weeks, D'mahl saw animation on his long face; fire,
perhaps even remembered ecstasy in his pale eyes. &quot;When the void
calls you to it,&quot; he said. &quot;you'll see. No use talking
about it. It calls, and you go, and that's what it's all about.
That's why we're all here.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's why you're here? What about all
this?&quot; D'mahl said, sweeping his hand in a circle to indicate
the roomful of instruments.</P>
<P>He could visibly see the life go out of Nyborg's
face; curtains came down over the fire in his eyes, and he was once
again Nyborg the cyborg.</P>
<P>&quot;All this is the mission,&quot; Nyborg
grunted, turning back to the readout screen. &quot;What gets us out
here. But the call is why we come. Why do you think we're called
voidsuckers?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why?&quot;</P>
<P>'We suck void,&quot; Nyborg said.</P>
<P>&quot;You mean you don't care about the mission?
You're not dedicated to finding us a new living world?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Drool,&quot; Nyborg muttered. &quot;Scoutships
don't need us, can run themselves. <I>We </I>need <I>them. </I>To get
us to the void.&quot; He deliberately began to feign intense interest
in what he was doing, and D'mahl could not extract a syllable more.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Just how long have you been on scoutships,
Areth?&quot; Jofe D'mahl said, looking up from his hopeless position
on the chessboard.</P>
<P>&quot;About a century and <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">a</SPAN><I>
</I>half,&quot; Areth Lorenzi said, still studying her next move. As
always, she volunteered nothing.</P>
<P>&quot;You must really be dedicated to the mission
to have spent such a long life out here in nowhere,&quot; D'mahl
said, trying to get something out of her. Those eyes hinted of so
much and that mouth said so little.</P>
<P>&quot;I've always heard the call.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What's this call I keep hearing about?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The void calls, and for those who are
called, there is nothing but the void. You think our lives are
sacrifices for the common good of humanity?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, aren't they?&quot;</P>
<P>Areth Lorenzi looked up at him with her ancient
crystalline eyes. &ldquo;We man the scoutships to reach the void, we
don't brave the void to man the scoutships,&quot; she said. &quot;We
sacrifice nothing but illusion. We live with the truth. We live for
the truth.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And the truth shall set you free?&quot;
D'mahl said archly. But the reference blew by her since she had no
way to tap for it.</P>
<P>Areth dropped her gaze. A note of bitterness came
into her voice. &quot;The truth is: No man is free.&quot; She moved
her rook to double-check D'mahl's king and queen. &quot;Checkmate in
three moves, D'mahl,&quot; she said.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>D'mahl found Haris Bandoora alone on the bridge
looking stern-ward, back toward where the Trek had been visible until
recently as a tiny bright disk among the pinpoint stars. Now the
Trek, if it was visible at all, was nothing more than one point of
light lost in a million others. Bela-37 seemed frozen in a black
crystal vastness speckled with immobile motes of sparkling dust, an
abstract universe of dubious reality.</P>
<P>A tremor of dread went through D'mahl, a twinge of
the most utter aloneness. Even the presence of the enigmatic and
aloof Bandoora seemed a beacon of human warmth in the dead uncaring
night.</P>
<P>&quot;Overwhelming, isn't it?&quot; Bandoora said,
turning at the sound of D'mahl's footfalls. &quot;A hundred million
stars, perhaps as many planets, and this one galaxy is a speck of
matter floating in an endless nothingness.&quot; There was a strange
overlay of softness in those dark and bottomless eyes, almost a
misting of tears. &quot;What are we, D'mahl? Once we were bits of
some insignificant anomaly called life contaminating a dust-mote
circling a speck of matter lost in a tiny cloud of specks, itself a
minor contaminant of the universal void. Now we're not even that. . .
.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We're the part that counts, Bandoora,&quot;
D'mahl said.</P>
<P>&quot;To whom?&quot; Bandoora said, nodding toward
the abyss. &quot;To <I>that?&quot;</I></P>
<P>&quot;To ourselves. To whatever other beings share
consciousness on planets around whichever of those stars. Sentience
is what counts, Bandoora. The rest of it is just backdrop.&quot;
D'mahl laughed hollowly. 
</P>
<P>&quot;If this be solipsism, let us make the most
of it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If only you knew . . .&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If only I knew what?&quot;</P>
<P>Bandoora smiled an ironic smile. &quot;You <I>will
</I>know,&quot; he said. &quot;That's why you're here. We can't be
alone with it forever.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&mdash;</FONT>&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I've heard the call, Haris.&quot; Raj Dora
had risen to the bridge, and now he walked rapidly to Bandoora's
side, his brown eyes feverish, an uncharacteristic languor in his
posture.</P>
<P>&quot;When?&quot; Bandoora asked crisply.</P>
<P>&quot;Now.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How long?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Twenty-four hours.&quot;</P>
<P>Bandoora turned and followed Doru toward the
droptube. &quot;What's going on?&quot; D'mahl asked, trailing after
them.</P>
<P>&quot;Raj is going to suck void,&quot; Bandoora
said. &quot;He's heard the call. Care to help me see him off?&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>At the round airlock door, Raj Doru took a
voidbubble-and-flitter harness from the rack, donned it, took a flask
of water and a cassette of ration out of a locker, and clipped them
to the belt of his shorts. His eyes looked off into some unguessable
reality that D'mahl could not begin to sync with.</P>
<P>&quot;What are you doing, Doru?&quot; he asked.</P>
<P>Doru didn't answer; he didn't even seem to notice
D'mahl's presence. &quot;Put on a voidbubble and see,&quot; Bandoora
said, taking two harnesses off the rack and handing one to him.</P>
<P>D'mahl and Bandoora donned their harnesses, then
Bandoora opened the airlock door and the three men stepped inside.
They erected their bubbles, Bandoora sealed the door behind them,
then the three of them walked through the shimmer screen onto the
scoutship's entrance stage.</P>
<P>Out on the narrow metal shelf, D'mahl found
himself utterly overwhelmed by the black immensities, the infinite
hole in which the scout-ship hung precariously suspended. This was
utterly unlike the view from his grand salon, for here there was no
concourse of ships or even torchtube wake to ease the impact of the
abyss upon the soul. Here there was only a tiny ship, the abstract
stars, three small men&mdash;and an infinity of nothing. D'mahl
reeled and quaked with a vertigo that pierced the core of his being.</P>
<P>&quot;Twenty-four hours, Haris,&quot; Doru tapped
on the com frequency. He spread his arms, turned on his g-polarizer,
and leaped up and out into the blackness of the interstellar abyss.</P>
<P><I>&quot;What's he doing?&quot; </I>D'mahl shouted
vocally. He caught himself, tapped the question to Bandoora as Doru
began to pick up velocity and dwindle into the blackness along a
vector at right angles to the ship's trajectory.</P>
<P>&quot;He's going to suck void for twenty-four
hours,&quot; Bandoora tapped. &quot;He's answering the call. He'll go
out far enough to lose sight of the ship and stay there for a
standard day.&quot;</P>
<P>Doru was already just a vague shape moving against
the backdrop of the starfield. As D'mahl watched, the shape fuzzed to
a formless point. &quot;What will he do out there?&quot; he asked
Bandoora quietly, a shudder racking his body.</P>
<P>&quot;What happens between a man and the void is
between a man and the void.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is it ... safe?&quot;</P>
<P><I>&quot;Safe? </I>We have a fix on him, and he's
still inside the cone of our interface. His body is safe. His mind .
. . that's between Raj and the void.&quot;</P>
<P>Now D'mahl could no longer make Doru out at all.
The voidsucker had vanished . . . into the void. D'mahl began to
catch his mental breath, realizing that he was missing the only prime
senso footage that had yet presented itself to him. He tried to tap
Doru through the ship's com frequency, but all he got was a reject
signal.</P>
<P>&quot;I've got to get this on tape, Bandoora! But
he's rejecting my tap.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I told you, what happens between a man and
the void is between that man and the void. The only way you'll ever
bring back a senso of <I>this </I>reality, D'mahl, is to experience
it in your own flesh and tap yourself.&quot;</P>
<P>D'mahl looked into Bandoora's cool even eyes; then
his gaze was drawn out into the black and starry depths into which
Doru had disappeared. To which Doru had willingly, even ecstatically,
given himself. Fear and fascination mingled inside him. Here was an
experience the contemplation of which caused his knees to tremble,
his heart to pound, and a cold wind to blow through his soul. Yet
here too was an experience whose parameters he could not predict or
fathom, a thing he had never done nor dreamed of doing, the thing
that lay at the core of what the voidsuckers were. The thing,
therefore, that was the core of the senso for which he was enduring
these endless months of boredom. A thing, therefore, that he must
inevitably confront.</P>
<P>&quot;Why do you do it?&quot; he tapped, turning
from the abyss to face Bandoora.</P>
<P>&quot;Each man has his own reason,&quot; the
voidsucker tapped. &quot;The call has many voices.&quot; He smiled a
knowing smile. &quot;You're beginning to hear it in your own
language, D'mahl,&quot; he said.</P>
<P>D'mahl shivered, for somewhere deep inside him,
the opening notes of that siren-song were indeed chiming, faraway
music from the depths of the beyond within.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Standing on the bridge watching Bandoora disappear
into the void, Jofe D'mahl felt like a hollow stringed instrument
vibrating to yet another strumming of the same endless chord. Doru,
Nyborg, Areth, Sidi, and now finally Bandoora had committed
themselves to the abyss in these past three weeks, Areth and Nyborg
twice apiece. Each of them had refused to let him tap them or even to
discuss the experience afterward, and each of them had come back
subtly changed. Doru seemed to have much of the hostility leached out
of him; Nyborg had become even less talkative, almost catatonic;
Areth seemed somehow slightly younger, perhaps a bit less distant:
and Sidi had begun to ignore him almost completely. He could find no
common denominator, except that each succeeding voidsuck had made him
feel that much more isolated on Bela-37, that much more alone, that
much more curious about what transpired between the human mind and
the void. Now that the last of them was out there, D'mahl felt the
process nearing completion, the monotonous chord filling his being
with its standing-wave harmonics.</P>
<P>&quot;Are you hearing it, Jofe D'mahl?&quot; the
quiet voice of Areth Lorenzi said beside him. &quot;Do you finally
hear the call?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'm not sure what I'm hearing,&quot; D'mahl
said, without looking away from the immensities outside the plex.
&quot;Maybe what I'm hearing is my own ego calling. I've got to get a
voidsuck on tape, or I've wasted all this time out here.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It's the call,&quot; Areth said. &quot;I've
seen it often enough. It comes to each along his own natural vector.&quot;</P>
<P>With ah effort, D'mahl turned to face her.
&quot;There's something you people aren't telling me,&quot; he said.
&quot;I can feel it. I know it.&quot;</P>
<P>Now it was Areth who spoke without looking at him,
whose eyes were transfixed by the overwhelming void. &quot;There is,&quot;
she said. &quot;The void at the center of all. The truth we live with
that you deny.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Drool on all this crypticism!&quot; D'mahl
snapped. &quot;What is this cosmic truth you keep teasing me with?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To know, you must first taste the void.&quot;</P>
<P><I>&quot;Why?&quot;</I></P>
<P>&quot;To know that, you must first answer the
call.&quot;</P>
<P>A wordless grunt of anger and frustration exploded
from D'mahl's throat. &quot;You think I don't know the game you
people are playing?&quot; he said. &quot;You think I don't know what
you're doing? But why? Why are you so anxious for me to suck void?
Why did you want me here in the first place?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because of who you are, Jofe D'mahl,&quot;
Areth said. &quot;Because of <I>Wandering Dutchmen. </I>Because you
may be the one we have sought. The one who can share the truth and
lift this burden from our souls.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Now it's flattery, is it?&quot;</P>
<P>Areth turned to face him, and he almost winced at
the pain, the despair, the pleading in her eyes. &quot;Not flattery,&quot;
she said. &quot;Hope. I ask you, one human being to another, to help
us. Bandoora would not ask, but I do. Lift our burden, D'mahl, heed
the call and lift our burden.&quot;</P>
<P>Unable to face those eyes, D'mahl looked off into
the star-speckled blackness. Bandoora could no longer be seen, but
something out there was indeed beckoning to him with an unseen hand,
calling to him with an unheard voice. Even his fear seemed to be a
part of it, challenging him to face the void within and the void
without and to carve something out of it if he had the greatness of
soul to dare.</P>
<P>&quot;All right,&quot; he said softly&mdash;to
Areth, to Bandoora, to all of them, and to that which waited beyond
the plex blister of the bridge. &quot;You've won. When Bandoora comes
back, I'll answer your damned call. As I once said, I've got nothing
to do but dare.&quot;</P>
<P>But the man who had said it seemed long ago and
far away.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>They were all out on the entrance stage in
voidbubbles to see him off. &quot;Eighteen standard hours, D'mahl,&quot;
Bandoora tapped over the com frequency. &quot;Remember, we've got a
fix on you, and we can come right out and get you if it becomes too
much. Just tap.&quot;</P>
<P>Inside his own bubble, D'mahl nodded silently. He
fingered his water flask and his ration cassette. He tapped the time
at 4.346. He could not for a moment draw his eyes away from the
endless black sea into which he was about to plunge. Millions of
pinpoint stars pulsed and throbbed in the darkness like needles
pricking his retinas. A silent roaring pulsed up at him from out of
the abyss, the howl of the eternal silences themselves. His body
seemed to end at the knees. The void appeared to be a tangible
substance reaching out to enfold him in its cold and oceanic embrace.
He knew that he must commit himself to it <I>now, </I>or in the next
moment flee gibbering and sweating into the psychic refuge of
Bela-37.</P>
<P>&quot;See you at 22.000,&quot; he tapped inanely,
activating his g-polarizer. Then he flexed his knees and dived off
the little metal shelf into the vast unknown.</P>
<P>The act of leaping into the abyss seemed to free
him of the worst of his fears, as if he had physically jumped out of
them, and for a while he felt no different than he had at times when,
flitting from one Trek ship to another, he had temporarily lost sight
of all. Then he looked back.</P>
<P>Bela-37 was a small metal cylinder slowly
dwindling into the starry darkness. The five tiny figures standing on
the entrance stage hovered on the edge of visibility and then melted
into the formless outline of the scoutship. Nothing else existed that
seemed real. Only the shrinking cylinder of metal, one single work of
man in all that nothing. D'mahl shuddered and turned his head away.
Somehow the sight of the pure void itself was less terrifying than
that of his last connection with the things of man disappearing from
view into its depths.</P>
<P>He did not look back again for a long time. When
he did, his universe had neither back nor front nor sides nor top nor
bottom. All around him was an infinite black hole dusted with
meaningless stars, and every direction seemed to be down. His mind
staggered, reeled, and rejected this impossible sensory data.
Polarities reversed, so that the entire universe of stars and
nothingness seemed to be collapsing in on him, crushing the breath
out of him. He screamed, closed his eyes, and was lost in the
four-dimensional whirlpool of his own vertigo.</P>
<P>By feel, he turned off the g-polarizer, whirling
inside the vacuum of his own mind, sucked spiraling downward into
meaningless mazes of total disorientation. Half whimpering, he opened
his eyes again to a new transformation.</P>
<P>It was as if he were imbedded in a clear,
motionless, crystalline substance englobed by a seamless black wall
onto which the stars had been painted. Nothing moved, no event
transpired, time could not be said to be passing. It was the very
essence of tranquillity; calming, eternal, serene.</P>
<P>D'mahl sighed, felt his constricted muscles relax
and his mind drift free. He floated in the void like an immortal
embryo in everlasting amnion, waiting for he knew not what. Nor
cared.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Time did not pass, but there was duration. D'mahl
floated in the void, and waited. Thirst came and was slaked, and he
waited. Hunger came; he nibbled ration, and waited. He grew aware of
the beating of his own heart, the pulsing of blood through his veins,
and he waited. The kinesthetic awareness of his own bodily functions
faded, and he still waited.</P>
<P>Nothing moved. Nothing lived. Nothing changed.
Silence was eternal. Gradually, slowly, and with infinite subtlety,
D'mahl's perception of his environment began to change again. The
comforting illusion of being held in crystalline suspension in a
finite reality enclosed by a painted backdrop of stars and blackness
began to fade under the inexorable pressure of durationless time and
forced contemplation. The clear crystal substance of space dissolved
into the nothingness whence his mind had conjured it, and as it did,
the stars became not points of pain on distant walls but motes of
incandescent matter an infinity away across vast gulfs of absolute
nothingness. The overwhelming blackness was not the painted walls of
a pocket reality but an utter absence of everything&mdash;light,
warmth, sound, motion, color, life&mdash;that went on and on without
boundaries to give it shape or span to give it meaning. This was the
void and he was in it.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Strangely, D'mahl now found that his mind could
encompass this mercilessly true perception of reality, however
awesome, however terrifying, without the shield of perceptual
illusions. Endless duration had stripped him of the ability to
maintain these illusions, and between gibbering terror and a cool,
detached acceptance of the only reality he could maintain, his mind
chose detachment.</P>
<P>He was, and he was in the void. That was reality.
He moved, and all else was static. That was real. He could hear the
sound of his own breath, and all else was silence. That was
inescapable truth. He could perceive his body's shape as the
interface between his internal reality and the nothingness outside,
and all else was formless forever in space and time. That was the
void. That was the universe. That was prime reality. That was the
reality from which men fled&mdash;into religion, dream, art, poetry,
philosophy, metaphysics, literature, film, music, war, love, hate,
paranoia, the senso and the tap. Into the infinity of realities
within.</P>
<P>Outside the realities of the mind there was
nothingness without form or end, minutely contaminated with flecks of
matter. And man was but the chance end-product of a chain of random
and improbable collisions between these insignificant contaminants.
The void neither knew nor cared. The void did not exist. It was the
eternal and infinite nonexistence that dwarfed and encompassed that
which did.</P>
<P>D'mahl floated in this abyss of nonbeing, duration
continued, and the void began to insinuate tendrils of its nonself
into his being, into his pith and core, until it was reflected by a
void within.</P>
<P>Jofe D'mahl experienced himself as a thin shell of
being around a core of nothingness floating in more nonbeing that
went on tunelessly and formlessly forever. He was the atom-thin
interface between the void without and the void within. He was an
anomaly in all that nothingness, a chance trick knot whereby
nothingness redoubled upon itself had produced
somethingness&mdash;consciousness, being, life itself. He was nothing
and he was everything there was. He was the interface. He did not
exist. He was all.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>For more timeless duration, Jofe D'mahl existed as
a bubble of consciousness in a sea of nonbeing, a chance bit of
matter recomplicated into a state it was then pleased to call life, a
locus of feeling in a nothingness that knew neither feeling nor
knowing itself. He had passed beyond terror, beyond pride, beyond
humility, into a reality where they had no meaning, where nothing had
meaning, not even meaning itself.</P>
<P>He tried to imagine other bubbles of consciousness
bobbing in the everlasting void&mdash;on Bela-37, on the ships of the
Trek, on unknown planets circling those abstract points of light
contaminating the sterile perfection of the abyss. But out here in
the true void, in this endless matrix of nonbeing, the notion that
consciousness, or even life itself, was anything but the improbable
product of a unique and delicate chain of random interactions between
bits of recomplicated nothingness called &quot;matter&quot; seemed
hopelessly jejune and pathetically anthropocentric. One possible
chain of unlikely events led to life and all others led back to
nothingness. One misstep on the part of nonexistent fate, and the
unlikely spell was broken.</P>
<P>The wonder was not that life had arisen so
sparsely, but that it had arisen at all.</P>
<P>D'mahl floated in the blackness of the abyss, in
the sea of timeless nonbeing, clinging to the life-preserver of one
incontrovertible truth. I am, he thought. I exist, and every thought
I've ever had, every reality that ever existed in my mind, also
exists. This may be prime reality, but everything that is, is real.</P>
<P>Coldly, calmly, almost serenely, Jofe D'mahl
waited in the silent immobile darkness for the recall signal from
Bela-37, the call to return from the nonbeing of the void to the
frail multiplexity of the worlds of man.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>They were all out on the entrance stage in
voidbubbles to greet him. Silently, they conveyed him inside the
scoutship, their eyes speaking of the new bond between them. With a
strange ceremoniousness, they escorted D'mahl into the ship's
commissary. Bandoora seated him at a short side of one of the
rectangular tables, then sat down across its length from him. The
others arranged themselves on either long side of the table. It would
have been a moot point as to who was at the foot and who the head
were it not for another of the scoutship's endless holos of space
forming the wall behind Bandoora. This one was a view of the galaxy
as seen from far out in the intergalactic emptiness, and it haloed
Bandoora's head in Stardust and blackness.</P>
<P>&quot;Now that you have confronted the void, Jofe
D'mahl,&quot; Bandoora said solemnly, &quot;you are ready to share
the truth.&quot;</P>
<P>Petty annoyance began to fade the reality of
D'mahl's so recent experience from the forefront of his
consciousness. This was beginning to seem like some kind of
ridiculous ceremony. Were they going to treat his experience out
there as an initiation into some ludicrous <I>religion? </I>Replete
with incantations, tribal secrets, and Bandoora as high priest?</P>
<P>&quot;Say what you have to say, Bandoora,&quot; he
said. &quot;But please spare me the formalities.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;As you wish, D'mahl,&quot; Bandoora said.
His eyes hardened, seemed to pick up black flashes of void from the
holo of space behind him. &quot;What happened between you and the
void is between you and the void,&quot; he said. &quot;But you felt
it. And for half a millennium our instruments have been confirming
it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Confirming what?&quot; D'mahl muttered. But
the quaver in his voice would not let him hide from that awful
foretaste that bubbled up into his consciousness from the void
inside.</P>
<P>&quot;We have instruments far beyond what we've
let you people believe,&quot; Bandoora said, &quot;and we've had them
for a long time. We've gravscanned tens of thousands of stars, not
thousands. We've found thousands of planets, not hundreds. We've
found hundreds of Earth-parameter planets orbiting in habitable
zones, not dozens. We've been lying, D'mahl. We've been lying to you
for centuries.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why?&quot; D'mahl whispered, knowing the
answer, feeling it screaming at him from the holo behind Bandoora's
head, from the voidsucker's opaque eyes, from the void beyond.</P>
<P>&quot;You know why,&quot; Doru said harshly,
&quot;Because they're nothing but dead rock and gas. Over seven
hundred of them, D'mahl.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All of them should have been teeming with
life by any parameters our scientists can construct,&quot; Areth
Lorenzi said. &quot;For centuries, we hoped that the next one or the
one after that would disprove the only possible conclusion. But we've
not found so much as a microbe on any of them. We have no hope left.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Gets as far as protein molecules sometimes,&quot;
Nyborg grunted. &quot;Maybe one in eighty.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But the telltale probes can't&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Telltales!&quot; Doru snorted. &quot;The
telltale probes are more illusion to protect you people! We've got
microspectrographs that could pick up a DNA molecule ten light-years
away, and we've had them for centuries.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We already know that 997-Beta-II is dead,&quot;
Sidi said. &quot;We knew it before we reported to the Council of
Pilots. This whole mission, like hundreds before it, is an empty
gesture.&quot;</P>
<P><I>&quot;But why have you been lying to us like
this?&quot; </I>D'mahl shouted. &quot;What right did you have? What&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What were we supposed to say?&quot; Bandoora
shouted back. &quot;That it's all dead? That life on Earth was a
unique accident? That nothing exists but emptiness and dead matter
and the murderers of the only life there ever was? What are we
supposed to say, D'mahl? What are we supposed to do?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;For over two centuries we have lived with
the conviction that our mission is hopeless,&quot; Areth said softly.
&quot;For over two centuries we have been leading the Trek from one
false hope to the next, knowing that hope was false. Don't judge us
too harshly. What else could we have done?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You could have told us,&quot; D'mahl
croaked. &quot;You could have told us the truth.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Could we?&quot; Areth said. &quot;Could we
have told you before you yourself confronted the void?&quot;</P>
<P>Anger and despair chased each other in a yin-yang
mandala at Jofe D'mahl's core. Anger at the smug arrogance of these
narrow lamer people who dared treat all of human civilization as
retarded children who could not be told the truth. Despair at the
awful nature of that truth. Anger at the thought that perhaps the
voidsuckers were hiding their true reason for silence, that they had
kept the Trek in ignorance so that they wouldn't risk the termination
of the scoutship program and with it the one act that gave their
lamer lives meaning. Despair at the treacherous thought that the
voidsuckers might be right after all, that the truth would shatter
the Trek like radiation-rotted plex. Anger at himself for even
thinking of joining the voidsuckers and sitting in such arrogant
judgment.</P>
<P>&quot;You lamer drool-ridden dreeks!&quot; D'mahl
finally snarled. &quot;How dare you judge us like that! Who do you
think you are, gods on Olympus? Living your narrow little lives,
cutting yourselves off from the worlds inside, and then presuming to
decide what we can face!&quot;</P>
<P>His flesh trembled, his muscles twanged like steel
wire tensed to the snapping point, and adrenaline's fire pounded
through his arteries as his hands ground into the edge of the table.</P>
<P>But the voidsuckers sat there looking up at him
quietly, and what he saw in their eyes was relief, not anger, or
reaction to anger.</P>
<P>&quot;Then you'll do it, D'mahl?&quot; Bandoora
said softly.</P>
<P>&quot;Do what?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Tell them in your own way,&quot; Areth said.
&quot;Lift the burden from us.&quot;</P>
<P><I>&quot;What?&quot;</I></P>
<P>&quot;When I tapped <I>Wandering Dutchmen, </I>I
felt you might be the one,&quot; Bandoora said. &quot;You sensed the
edges of the truth. You seemed to be looking at the void and yet
beyond. You know your people, D'mahl, as we do not. You've just said
it yourself. Tell them. Make a senso that tells them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All this . . . this whole trip ... it was
all a trick to get me out here ... to tell me this ... to drop your
load of slok on me. . . .&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I promised you the chance to make the
greatest senso of your career,&quot; Bandoora said. &quot;Did I lie?&quot;</P>
<P>D'mahl subsided into his chair. &quot;But you
didn't tell me I was going to have to succeed,&quot; he said.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3>IV</H3>
<P>The scoutship came in tail-first on a long shallow
arc over the hydrogen interface, still decelerating. Tapping
Bela-37's visual frequency, Jofe D'mahl saw the ships of the Trek
suddenly appear in all their glory as the scoutship passed the
auroral wavefront, as if the interface were a rainbow curtain going
up on a vast ballet of motion and light.</P>
<P>Thousands of shining cylinders hung in the
blackness, their surfaces jeweled with multicolored lights. The space
between them coruscated and shone with shuttle exhausts and a haze of
subtle reflections off thousands of moving voidbubbles. The thin
purple wake of the Trek cut an ethereal swath of manifested motion
and time through the eternal immobile nothingness.</P>
<P>The Trek seemed larger and lovelier than even
D'mahl's memory had made it during the long sullen trip hack. Its
light drove back the everlasting darkness, its complexity shattered
the infinite sameness of the void; it danced in the spotlight of its
own brilliance. It was alive. It was beautiful. It was home.</P>
<P>Bandoora had calculated well; as Bela-37 passed
stemward of the Trek, its relative velocity dwindled away to zero and
it hung in space about twenty kilometers behind the great concourse
of ships. Bandoora turned the scoutship end-for-end and began to ease
it toward the Trek, toward its eventual parking slot just behind the
hydrogen interface. D'mahl broke his tap with the scout's visual
frequency and lay on the g-plate in his room for a long moment
staring into the starfield holo before him for the last time.</P>
<P>Then, like a lover reaching for remembered flesh
after a long parting, like a man rising out of a long coma toward the
dawning light, he tapped Jiz Rumoku.</P>
<P>He was sitting at a clear glass table sipping an
icy blue beverage out of a pewter mug, washing down a swallow of
lavender sponge. Across the table, Varn Kamenev was pouring himself
another mugful from a matching pitcher. The table was on a disk of
clear plex, floating, like dozens of others, through what seemed like
a topless and bottomless forest of ivy. He didn't recognize the
restaurant, but didn't bother to tap for it.</P>
<P>&quot;Home is the hero,&quot; he said with Jiz's
throat and lips, feeling her body warm to his presence.</P>
<P>&quot;Jof! Where are you, what happened, let me
tap&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Wait for the flesh, Jiz,&quot; he told her.
&quot;I'll be in your gallery within two hours. I wanted you to be
the first, but I've got to zip-tap my way back to realities before I
die of thirst.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But what was it like&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Miles and miles of miles and miles,&quot; he
said, feeling a surge of exhilaration at the thought that he was with
someone who could and would tap for the reference. &quot;Next year in
Jerusalem,&quot; he said with her mouth. He kissed her hand with her
lips and broke the tap.</P>
<P>And zip-tapped through the changes like a random
search program for the phantom tapper.</P>
<P>He was Para Running, soaring naked in a low-g dive
into a pool of fragrant rose-colored water heated to body
temperature. He watched Bela-37 pop through the hydrogen interface
with himself aboard from the sensorium track of the shuttle pilot,
then watched it arrive back at the Trek on the news-summary
frequency. He stood in his own grand salon glaring through the
party's mists at Haris Bandoora, then tapped it in realtime&mdash;the
bare emerald floor, the darkened crystal trees, and, beyond the plex,
the great concourse of ships shining in the galactic night.</P>
<P>He was in John Benina's body, looking down on
Sundance Corridor. Vines crawled up and down the sheer glass faces of
the apartments now, and pines grew around the faceted mirror in the
center of the square, subduing the usual brilliance. He tapped a
fragment of <I>Let a Thousand Flowers Bloom, </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">a</SPAN><I>
</I>senso by Iran Capabula that had been premiered during his
absence: bent over under a yellow sun in a clear blue sky, he was
weeding an endless field of fantastically colorful flowers, soaked in
their incenselike perfume. He danced a few measures of <I>Starburst
</I>as male lead for the Far Look Ballet. He made love for the first
time on a hill of blue fur in <I>Samarkand, </I>for the last time at
Jiz's, and a dozen times in between. He edited <I>Blackout, </I>his
first senso, and <I>Wandering Dutchmen, </I>his latest. He dined
amidst colored clouds on <I>Ariel </I>and at the shore of Blood Lake
on <I>Lothlorien </I>and a dozen other meals between. He tapped
random sequences of every senso he had ever made.</P>
<P>And when he was through, he was one with the
D'mahl that had been, he was back in the universe of infinite
realities that he had left; he was whole, and he was home.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><I>Brigadoon, </I>as D'mahl had expected, was
totally transformed. But the nature of the current flash was hardly
anything that he would have expected, and something about it chilled
him at the core.</P>
<P>Twodeck was a sim of an ancient Alpine Earth
village&mdash;simmed wooden houses, grass growing on synthetic loam,
pine trees; even the bulkheads were hidden by a 36o-degree holo of
snowcapped mountains under a blue sky. The amusements of sixdeck had
been cut down and ludicrously simplified to fit into an American
county fair motif: Ferris wheel, merry-go-round, dart-and-balloon
games, a baseball diamond, even mechanical sims of prize cattle,
sheep, dogs, and pigs. Once again, the deck was enclosed in a
36o-degree holo, this one of fields of corn waving in a breeze.
Eightdeck, a residential deck, was a simmed African village&mdash;thatched
huts in a circle, a kraal containing mechanical cattle and antelope,
lions and hyenas slinking about the holoed veldt that enclosed it.
Tendeck had actually been made over into a functional dirtdigger
deck: row after row of pine tree seedlings, thickly-packed vine
trellises, beds of flowers, people in dirtdigger green bustling about
everywhere.</P>
<P>It wasn't so much the theme of the flash that
appalled D'mahl&mdash; <I>Brigadoon </I>had gone through nature
flashes before&mdash;but the monomania of its application, the
humorlessness of it all, the sheer lack of brio. This latest
transformation of <I>Brigadoon </I>seemed so deadly earnest, an
attempt to accurately sim old Earth environments rather than to use
them to ring artistic changes.</P>
<P>Twelvedeck, Jiz's deck, the epicenter of all of
<I>Brigadoon's </I>waves of transformation, appalled him most of all.
Everything was wood and trees. The shops and restaurants were
constructed of simmed logs with rough bark on them; the windows were
small square panes of plex set in wooden grillworks. The furniture in
them was of simmed rough-hewn wood. The paths were flagstone. Huge
simmed chestnut and eucalyptus trees were everywhere, towering to the
ceiling of the deck to form an almost seamless forest canopy, and
dwarfing and almost crowding out the modest neoprimitive cabins. The
air had been made redolent with the odors of burning leaves and
moldering loam; birdcalls and vague animal rustlings burbled
continually in the ear.</P>
<P>Jiz Rumoku's gallery was a single large room
carved out of the simmed stump of what would have been an enormous
redwood tree, with her living quarters a rude lean-to atop it.
Inside, the walls and floor were simmed redwood planking, the ceiling
was ribbed by heavy wooden beams, and an orange fire flickered and
roared in a red brick fireplace. Elegant simmed oak tables and chests
in the clean, severe Shaker style served to display representational
woodcarvings, clay pottery, blue-and-white ceramic dishes, simple
gold and silver jewelry, wickerwork baskets and animals, neohomespun
clothing. Cast iron stoves, scythes, tools, and plowshares were
scattered around the gallery.</P>
<P>Jiz stood behind a low table wearing a clinging,
form-fitting dress of red-and-white checked gingham, cut in
bare-breasted Minoan style. She was drinking something out of a clay
mug.</P>
<P>&quot;Jof!&quot; she shouted, and they
cross-tapped. D'mahl felt the scratchiness of the dress against her
skin as his body kissed her lips and his arms hugged him to her. He
tasted the remnants of the drink in her mouth&mdash;something sweet,
slightly acrid, and vaguely alcoholic. His own lips tasted hard and
electric by comparison.</P>
<P>&quot;I don't know where to begin!&quot; she said,
as they broke the tap. &quot;Let me tap your sensorium track of the
trip!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not in the banks yet,&quot; D'mahl said.
&quot;Remember, I was cut off.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's right! How bizarre! Are you actually
going to have to <I>tell </I>me about it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'll tap the recordings into the banks soon
enough,&quot; D'mahl mumbled, wondering whether he was lying. &quot;But
in the meantime, what's all <I>this, </I>talking about bizarre?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's right,&quot; Jiz said, &quot;you <I>have
</I>been out of touch. How strange! The transmutational flash didn't
last quite as long as I had expected, mostly because it began to seem
so artificial, so out of sync with our future vector.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Future vector?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Eden.&quot;</P>
<P><I>&quot;Eden?&quot;</I></P>
<P>&quot;Our coming new home, Jof. We couldn't keep
calling it 997-Beta II, could we? We had a referendum and 'Eden' won,
though I preferred Olympia. I've always found the Greek mythos more
simpatico.&quot;</P>
<P>Chimes of nausea rolled through D'mahl's being
from a center of nothingness below his sternum. &quot;Don't you think
all this is a bit premature, Jiz?&quot; he said.</P>
<P>&quot;That's the nature of my game, Jof, you know
that,&quot; Jiz said, touching the tip of his nose with a playful
fingertip. &quot;But this time, I'm doing more than creating flash.
I'm helping to prepare us for the transformation.&quot;</P>
<P><I>&quot;Transformation?&quot;</I></P>
<P>She flitted around the gallery, touching wood,
brick, clay, wicker, iron. &quot;Oh Jof, you said it yourself in
<I>Wandering Dutchmen! </I>Flying Dutchmen on an endless sea, that's
what we've been too long. Eternal adolescents low-riding our faerie
ships through the night. And now that we've got a chance to grow up,
to sink new roots in fresh soil, we've got to sync our minds with the
coming reality, we've got to climb off the torch we're riding and get
closer to the ground. Wood, brick, iron, clay, growing things!
<I>Planetary </I>things! We're preparing ourselves to pioneer a
virgin world.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Slok,&quot; D'mahl muttered under his
breath. &quot;Dirtdigger slok,&quot; he said aloud. Something like
anger began simmering toward nova inside him.</P>
<P>Jiz paused, a butterfly frozen in mid-dance.
&quot;What?&quot;</P>
<P>D'mahl looked at her, bare breasts held high over
red-and-white gingham, proudly presiding over the synthetic
primitivism she had created, over the vain and pathetic dream that
would never be, and for a long moment she seemed to be made of thin
clear glass that would shatter at the merest sound of his voice. The
gallery, twelvedeck, <I>Brigadoon, </I>the Trek were clouds of smoke
that would dissipate at a careless wave of his hand. Beyond and
within, the void gibbered and laughed at poor wraiths who tried so
hard to be real. How can I tell her? D'mahl thought. And to what end?
To what damned end?</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing,&quot; he said lamely. &quot;I guess
I just don't like the idea of growing up. I've got too much pan in my
peter.&quot;</P>
<P>Jiz giggled as she tapped the triple-reference
pun, and it enabled the moment to slide by. But D'mahl felt a
distancing opening up between himself and Jiz, between himself and
the Trek, between reality and illusion. Is this what it feels like to
be a voidsucker? he wondered. If it is, you can torch it to plasma
and feed it to the converter!</P>
<P>&quot;But you've been out there, Jof,&quot; Jiz
said, moving back across the gallery toward him. &quot;You've read
the telltale wavefront, you've looked inside the gates of Eden.&quot;
Her eyes sparkled, but beyond that sugarplum glow D'mahl saw only the
lurking void. &quot;Are there oceans with fish and skies full of
birds? Is the grass green? Do the plants flower?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A gentleman never tells,&quot; D'mahl
muttered. What do I say, that the green grass is copper salts and the
oceans are blue with cyanide and the skies full of poison? He began
to feel more sympathy for the voidsuckers now. How could you make a
life out of telling people these things? How do <I>you </I>like being
the angel of death?</P>
<P><I>&quot;Jof!&quot; </I>
</P>
<P>&quot;I can't say anything, Jiz, I promised not
to.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh come on, how could the voidsuckers or the
Council squeeze a promise like that out of you?&quot;</P>
<P>With enormous effort, D'mahl painted a smug smile
across his face; the creases in his skin felt like stress-cracks in a
mask of glass. &quot;Because that's the quid I'm paying for their pro
quo, ducks,&quot; he said.</P>
<P>&quot;You mean . . . ?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's right. You didn't think I'd spend all
that time out there and let some dry-as-Luna bulletin from the
Council upstage me, did you? No bulletin&mdash;997-Beta-II&mdash;Eden&mdash;is
my next senso.&quot;</P>
<P>Jiz bounced up, then down, and kissed him on the
lips. &quot;I cog it'll be your greatest,&quot; she said.</P>
<P>D'mahl hugged her briefly to him, his eyes looking
through her mane of hair to a set of plain clay dishes on an oaken
chest beside the brick fireplace. He shuddered, feeling the void
inside every atom of every molecule of matter in those simmed
projections of a past that was dead forever into a future that would
never be. He was committed to doing it now, the way through was the
only way out, and he had taken it upon himself to find it.</P>
<P>&quot;It had better be,&quot; he said. &quot;It
had damned well better be.&quot;</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>D'mahl stood in Aric Moreau's body amidst solemn
people in their loathsome homespun wandering drool-eyed through
tightly packed rows of pine seedlings jamming a dirtdigger deck on
<I>Glade. </I>There was no attempt to sim anything here; the
dirtdiggers were force-growing a forest for transplantation to the
nonexistent fertile soil of Eden, and, as with the other dirtdigger
decks he had tapped, aesthetics had been gobbled up by function.
Angrily, he made excrement rain from the sky, turned the fashionable
neohomespun garments to filthy denim rags, and threw in a few
wrathful lightning bolts for good measure.</P>
<P>He ran the segment of Bela-37's report where the
holo of 997-Beta-II hung like an overripe fruit in the center of the
scoutship's bridge and made a tongue and mouth appear at the equator,
giving <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">a</SPAN><I> </I>big juicy
raspberry. He floated in the void, falling, falling, eternally
falling into an infinite black hole dusted with meaningless stars. He
caused the stars to become crudely painted dots on black paper, and
punched his way out of the paper-bag continuum and into&mdash;the
abyss.</P>
<P>He tapped a newstape from 708, the year
557-Gamma-IV had been the light that failed, and watched Trekkers in
Biblical-style robes moping about a dirtdigger deck crammed with
overgrown flower beds and the reek of rotting vegetation. He
exaggerated the sour expressions into ludicrous clown caricatures of
themselves that melted slowly into pumpkins, and Big Ben chimed
midnight. He stood poised on the entrance stage of Bela-37, reeling
and quaking, utterly overwhelmed by the black immensities in which
the scoutship hung precariously suspended.</P>
<P>He snorted, took the effects ring off his head
like a discarded crown, and sat in the cocoon chair staring moodily
at the microtape pod turning futilely on the output spindle of his
editor. He pressed a blue button and wiped the pod. The slok I've
been laying down these three days just isn't worth saving, he
thought. I'm just diddling with the banks and the effects ring; it
doesn't add up to anything.</P>
<P>And time was growing short. Everyone knew that
Bela-37 had returned, and everyone knew that the reason there had
been no bulletin was that Jofe D'mahl was going to release the news
in the form of a senso. Jiz in her innocence and Bandoora in his
cowardly cunning had seen to that. The longer it took for the senso
to appear, the more cosmic import it took on, and the more certain
people became that the only possible reason for releasing the
scoutship report in this bizarre manner was to do karmic justice to
the greatest and most joyous event in the history of the Trek, to
write a triumphant finis to man's long torchship ride.</P>
<P>So the longer he sat here dead in space like a
ship with its torch blown out, the farther people would travel along
hope's false vector, the worse the crash would be when it came, the
harder it became to conceive of a senso that could overcome all that
dynamic inertia, and on into the next turning of the terrible screw.
Now D'mahl understood only too well why the voidsuckers had chosen to
lie for half a millennium. The longer the lie went on, the more
impossible it became to dare to tell the truth.</P>
<P>And what was the way out that the voidsuckers
took? They ignored the asymptotic nature of the Frankenstein Monster
they had created and gave themselves over to the void! For them, the
ultimate reality was the greatest escape illusion of them all.</P>
<P>D'mahl slammed both hands angrily down on the edge
of the editor console. All right, damn it, if the void is where all
vectors lead, then the void has to be the core'! It's the best
footage I've got anyway. I'll go to the center, and I won't come back
till I've got the heart of this senso beating in the palm of my hand.</P>
<P>He fitted the pod of his voidsuck onto the
editor's auxiliary playback spindle and programmed continuous-loop
replay. He started to program a twenty-four-standard-hour limit, then
changed his mind. No, he thought, I want the power in my hand, and I
want this to be open-ended. He programmed a cut-off command into the
effects ring bank, threw blocks across all other effects programming,
and put the ring on his head.</P>
<P>Now he would confront his void footage as if it
were the original naked reality, with only the power to break the
loop, without the reality-altering powers of the editor. And I won't
use the cutoff until I can come back with what I need, he promised
himself as he opened his tap to the voidsuck pod. 1 won't come back
until I can come back riding my own torch again.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>He was an immortal embryo floating free in the
eternal amnion of the universal abyss, and the millions of stars were
motes of incandescent matter an infinity away across vast gulfs of
absolute nothingness. The overwhelming blackness was an utter absence
of everything&mdash;light, warmth, sound, color, life&mdash;that went
on and on without boundaries to give it shape or span to give it
meaning. This was the void and he was in it.</P>
<P>But to his surprise, D'mahl found that his mind
now immediately grasped this mercilessly true perception of reality
without illusion, and with only the residual somatic vertigo and
terror recorded on the sensorium tape. Even this soon faded as the
tape's memory caught up with the cool clarity of mind it had taken
him an unknown duration of disorientation and terror to achieve in
realtime.</P>
<P>He was, and he was in the void. He moved, and all
else was static. He could perceive his body's shape, the interface
between his internal reality and the nothingness outside, and all
else was without edge or interface forever in space and time. Outside
the realities of his own mind was void without form or end, minutely
contaminated with flecks of matter, and man was but the chance
end-product of a chain of random and improbable collisions between
these insignificant contaminants. The void neither knew nor cared.
The void did not exist. It was the eternal and infinite nonexistence
that dwarfed and encompassed that which did. D'mahl experienced
himself as a thin shell of being around a core of nothingness
floating in more nonbeing, a trick anomaly of somethingness lost in
timeless and formless forever. Nothing had meaning, not even meaning
itself. The wonder was not that life had arisen but once in this
endless matrix of nonbeing, but that it had arisen at all.</P>
<P>Black void, meaninglessly dusted with untouchable
stars, the internal churnirigs of his own flesh, the utter knowledge
of the utter emptiness that surrounded him, and timeless duration.
Once you have reached this place, D'mahl thought, then what? Once
asked, the question became ridiculous, for here in the void there was
nothing to address any question to but himself. There was nothing to
perceive but the absence of perception. There was nothing to
perceive. There was nothing. There wasn't.</P>
<P>D'mahl floated in physical nothingness and mental
void waiting for the transcendent revelation he had sought. Waiting
for the revelation. Waiting for. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Games chased themselves through his mind as he
waited in the absence of event, in the absence of meaningful
perception, in the absence of measurable time, in the total absence.
He counted his own pulsebeats trying to reestablish time, but soon
lost count and forgot even what he had been doing. He tried to
imagine the nature of what it was he sought, but that immediately
tangled itself up in tautological feedback loops: if he knew what he
sought, he would not have to seek it. He tried to speculate on what
lay beyond the infinite nothingness that surrounded him in order to
establish some frame of metaphysical reference, but any such concept
hovered forever in unreachable realms of mathematical gobbledygook.
He tried to immerse himself in the nothingness itself and found he
was there already.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Games evaporated from his consciousness, and then
the possibility of games, and he became nothing but a viewpoint
trapped in a vacuum of nondata. The blackness of space could no
longer be perceived as anything like a color, and the stars became no
more than mere flecks of retinal static. Vision and hearing were
becoming forgotten concepts in this utter nonreality where the only
sensory data seemed to be the noise in the sensory systems
themselves.</P>
<P>Thought itself began to follow the senses into
oblivion, and finally there was nothing left but a focus of ache in
the vast and endless nothing, a bonging mantra of boredom so total,
so complete, so without contrast tliat it became a world of universal
pain.</P>
<P>No, not even pain, for pain would have been
welcome relief here.</P>
<P>Something somewhere whimpered. Something nowhere
whimpered. Nothing nowhere whimpered. Why? Why? Why? it cried. Why?
Why? Why? Why is this happening to me? Why is this not happening to
me? Why doesn't something happen? Happen . . . happen . . . happen .
. . happen . . . happen . . . happen . . .</P>
<P>A mental shout shattered the void. &quot;Why am I
doing this to myself?&quot;</P>
<P>And there was mind, chastising itself. And there
was mind, chastising itself for its own stupidity. There was mental
event, there was content, there was form.</P>
<P>There was the mind of Jofe D'mahl floating forever
in eternal boredom. And laughing at itself.</P>
<P>You <I>are </I>doing this to yourself, you silly
dreek! D'mahl realized. And with that realization, the meaningless
patterns on his retinas resolved themselves into a vision of the
galactic abyss, speckled with stars. And in his mind, that vision
further resolved itself into microtape unreeling endlessly on a pod
in his editor in his living quarters on <I>Excelsior </I>near the
center of the Trek.</P>
<P>You're doing it <I>all </I>to yourself, cretin!
<I>You </I>control this reality, but you forgot you control it. There
isn't any problem. There never was a problem. The only problem is
that we refused to see it.</P>
<P>&quot;Cut,&quot; D'mahl tapped, and he was sitting
in his cocoon chair bathed in his own sweat, staring at the console
of his editor, laughing, feeling the power of his own torch coursing
through him, crackling from his fingertips, enlivening his exhausted
flesh.</P>
<P>Laughing, he cleared the blocks from his effects
banks. Who needs planets? Who needs life beyond the germ we carry?
Who needs prime reality at all?</P>
<P><I>&quot;R<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&eacute;</FONT>alit<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&eacute;</FONT>,
c'est moi,&quot; </I>D'mahl muttered. He had said it before, but
hadn't savored its full meaning. For on his brow he wore not a crown
of thorns but the crown of creation.</P>
<P>He ran back a few feet of the tape and floated
once more in the empty star-dusted blackness. He laughed. &quot;Let
there be light,&quot; he tapped. And behold, the firmament shattered,
and there was light.</P>
<P>&quot;Cut,&quot; Jofe D'mahl tapped. And sat
hovering over his editor. And began to carve another segment of his
own meaning out of the void.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>A bright golden light fills your vision and a
delicious warm glow suffuses your body. The light recedes until it
becomes something no naked human eye could bear: the plasma heart of
a torchtube, which seems to beat and throb like a living thing. And
now you are straddling this phoenix-flame; it grows between your legs
and yet you are riding it through a galaxy preternaturally filled
with stars, a blazing firmament of glory. As you ride faster and
faster, as the warm glow in your body builds and builds with every
throb of the torchtube, letters of fire light-years high appear
across the starfield:</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H5>RIDING THE TORCH</H5>
<H5>by Jofe D'mahl</H5>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>And you scream in ecstasy and the universe
explodes into crystal shards of light.</P>
<P>An old man with long white hair, a matted white
beard, dressed in an ancient grimy robe, sits on a fluffy white cloud
picking his red, beak-like nose. He has wild-looking pop eyes under
bushy white brows and a shock of lightning bolts in his right hand.
On the cloud next to him sits Satan in a natty red tuxedo, black
cape, and bow tie, with apple-green skin and a spiffy black Vandyke.
He is puffing on the end of his long sinuous tail, exhaling
occasional whiffs of lavender smoke that smells of brimstone. You are
watching this scene from slightly above, inhaling stray Satanic
vapors. They are mildly euphoric.</P>
<P>&quot;Job, Job,&quot; Satan says. &quot;Aren't you
ever going to get tired of bragging about that caper? What did it
prove, anyway?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That my creatures love me no matter how much
crap I dump on them,&quot; the old man says. &quot;I don't see them
building no Sistine Chapels to <I>you, </I>Snake-eyes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You really are a sadistic old goat, aren't
you? You ought to audition for <I>my </I>part.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You think I couldn't do it? You think you're
such a red-hot badass?&quot; The old man stands up, scowling
thunders, brandishing his lightning bolts. &quot;By the time I got
through with those yucks, they'd be drooling to <I>you </I>for mercy.
Either way, I am the greatest. Remember how I creamed those
Egyptians?&quot;</P>
<P>Satan blows lavender smoke at him. &quot;Ten
crummy plagues and a drowning scene. Strictly amateur stuff.&quot;</P>
<P><I>&quot;Oh yeah? Oh yeah?&quot; </I>the old man
shouts, flinging random lightning bolts, his eyes rolling like
pinwheels. &quot;I'll show you who's the tail-torcher around here!
I'll show you who's Lord God Allah Jehovah, King of the Universe!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, really?&quot; Satan drawls. &quot;Tell
you what, you want to make it double or nothing on the Job bet?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Anytime, Snake-eyes, anytime!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Okay, Mr. I Am, you dumped all you had on
Job and he still crawled on his hands and knees to kiss your toes. If
you're such a hotshot, let's see you break them. All of them. Let's
see you make the whole human race curl up into fetal balls, stick
their thumbs in their mouths, and give up. That's the bet, Mr. In the
Beginning. I'll take them against you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You gotta be kidding! I run this whole show!
I'm omniscient, omnipotent, and I can deal marked cards off the
bottom of the deck.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'll give you even money anyway.&quot;</P>
<P>The old man breaks into maniacal laughter. Satan
looks up into your face, shrugs, and twirls his finger around his
right temple. &quot;You got a bet, sonny!&quot; the old man says.
&quot;How's <I>this </I>for openers?&quot; And with a mad whoop, he
starts flinging lightning bolts down from his cloud onto the world
below.</P>
<P>You are standing in a crowded street in Paris as
the sky explodes and the buildings melt and run and the Eiffel Tower
crumples and falls and your flesh begins to slough off your bones.
You are a great bird, feathers aflame in a burning sky, falling
toward a wasteland of blowing ash and burning buildings. You are a
dolphin leaping out of a choking bitter sea into sandpaper air. You
stand beside your orange orchard watching the trees ignite like
torches under a sky-filling fireball as your hair bursts into flame.
You lie, unable to breathe, on an endless plain of rubble and gray
ash, and the sky is a smear of cancerous purples and browns.</P>
<P>You are watching Satan and the wild-eyed old man
drifting above the ruined ball of the Earth on their fleecy clouds.
Satan looks a bit greener than before, and he sucks nervously on the
end of his tail. The old man, grinning, flings occasional lightning
bolts at small islands of green below, turning them to more gray ash
and purplish-brown wasteland.</P>
<P>&quot;Zap!&quot; the old man giggles, flinging a
bolt. &quot;How's <I>that, </I>Snake-eyes? I <I>told </I>you I was
omnipotent. They never had a chance. Fork over, Charley!&quot; He
holds out the palm of his left hand.</P>
<P>&quot;I've got to admit that tops your Land of
Egypt number,&quot; Satan says. &quot;However . . .&quot; He takes
his tail out of his mouth and blows a pointed arrow of lavender smoke
upward past your nose. Following it, you see dozens of distant
silvery cylinders moving outward into the starry blackness of the
galactic night.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, yeah?&quot; the old man says, cocking a
lightning bolt at the fleet of converted asteroid freighters. &quot;I'll
take care of <I>that!&quot;</I></P>
<P>&quot;Hold on, Grandpa!&quot; Satan drawls. &quot;You
can't win your bet that way! If there are none of them left to give
up, then I win and you lose.&quot;</P>
<P>Trembling with rage, the old man uncocks his
throwing arm. His eyes whirl like runaway galaxies, his teeth grind
into each other, and black smoke steams out of his ears. &quot;You
think you're so damned smart, do you? You think you can get the best
of the old Voice from the Whirlwind, do you? You think those shaved
apes have a chance of making it to the next green island in their
lousy tin-can outrigger canoes?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There's a sweet little world circling Tau
Ceti, and they've got what it takes to get that far,&quot; Satan
says, throwing you a little wink on the side.</P>
<P>&quot;Don't tell me about Tau Ceti!&quot; the old
man roars. &quot;I'm omnipotent, I'm omniscient, and I can lick any
being in this bar!&quot; He snaps his fingers and you, he, and Satan
are standing on a rolling meadow of chartreuse grass under a
royal-blue sky scudded with faerie traceries of white cloud. Huge
golden fernlike trees sway gently in a sweet fragrant breeze, swarms
of tiny neon-bright birds drift among beds of huge orange-, emerald-,
ruby-, and sapphire-colored flowers, filling the air with eldritch
music. Red velvety kangaroolike creatures with soulful lavender eyes
graze contentedly, leap about, and nuzzle each other with long mobile
snouts.</P>
<P>&quot;Here's your sweet little world circling Tau
Ceti,&quot; the old man snarls. &quot;Here's the new Eden those
monkeys are making for, and it's as good a job as I did on Earth, if
I do say so myself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Maybe better,&quot; Satan admits.</P>
<P>&quot;Is <I>it?&quot; </I>the old man howls with a
voice of thunder. And his eyes rumble and he flings a handful of
lightning bolts into the air, and his face turns bright red with rage
as he screams: &quot;Turn to slok!&quot;</P>
<P>And the sky becomes a sickly chemical violet
veined with ugly gray clouds. And the chartreuse grass, the golden
fern trees, and the bright flowers dissolve into a slimy brown muck
as the birds and red velvet kangaroos evaporate into foul purple
mists. And the brown muck and purple mists mingle and solidify. . . .</P>
<P>And you are clad in a heavy spacesuit, standing on
an endless plain of purplish-brown rock under a cruel dead sky, one
of a dozen suited, men crawling over the planetary corpse like ants
on a bone pile.</P>
<P>You are watching Satan and the old man hovering
over the converted asteroid freighters of the Trek as they slink away
from Tau Ceti V into the galactic night. A gray pall seems to exude
from the ships, as if the plex of their ports and blisters were
grimed with a million years of despair's filth.</P>
<P>&quot;Take a look at them now!&quot; the old man
crows. He snaps his fingers and the three of you are looking down
into a primitive dirtdigger deck from a catwalk. The scudding of
green is like an unwholesome fungus on the synthetic loam, the air
smells of ozone, and the dirtdiggers below are gray hunchbacked
gnomes shuffling about as if under 4 gs. &quot;It won't be long now,&quot;
the old man says. &quot;It's a century to the next live world I've
put out here. None of them are going to live to see it, and boy oh
boy, do they know it!&quot;</P>
<P>He snaps his fingers again and the three of you
are standing by the torchtube in a first-generation residence deck:
grim blue corridors, leaden overheads, ugly steel plating, row after
row of identical gray doors. The people plodding aimlessly up and
down seem as leached of color and life as their surroundings.</P>
<P>&quot;And before their children can get there,
they're going to start running out of things,&quot; the old man says.
&quot;Carbon for their flesh. Calcium for their bones. Phosphorus for
their life's juices. Iron for their blood.&quot; The light begins to
get dim, the walls begin to get misty. The people begin to slump and
melt, and you can feel your own bones begin to soften, your blood
thinning to water; your whole body feels like a decomposing pudding.
&quot;They're going to turn slowly to slok themselves,&quot; the old
man says, leering.</P>
<P>He snaps his fingers once more, and you are an
abstract viewpoint beside the old man and Satan as they hang over the
dimming lights of the Trek.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, Snake-eyes, are you ready to pay up
now?&quot; the old man says smugly, holding out his palm.</P>
<P>&quot;They haven't given up yet,&quot; Satan says,
dragging on the tip of his tail.</P>
<P>&quot;You're a stubborn dreek!&quot; the old man
snaps irritably.</P>
<P>Satan blows out a plume of lavender smoke that
seems endless. It billows and grows and expands into a great cloud of
mist that completely envelops the fleet of converted asteroid
freighters. &quot;So are they,&quot; he says.</P>
<P>And when the lavender mist clears, the Trek has
been transformed. Where there had been scores of converted asteroid
freighters slinking through space in their own pall of gloom, there
are now hundreds of new Trekborn torchships coruscating like a
pirate's treasure of jewels against the black velvet of the night,
promenading through the abyss behind their own triumphant rainbow
shield, the hydrogen interface.</P>
<P>Satan laughs, he cracks his long sinuous tail like
a whip, and the three of you are standing beside the great
circumtorchtube coils of a sifting deck, amid recovery canisters,
control consoles, and a Medusa's head of transfer coils. You can feel
the immense power of the torch in your bones, through the soles of
your feet. Satan points grandly from canister to canister with the
tip of his tail. &quot;Carbon for their flesh,&quot; he mimics in a
croaking parody of the old man's voice. &quot;Calcium for their
bones. Phosphorus for their life's juices. Iron for their blood. And
all of it from the interstellar medium itself, which you can't get
rid of without shutting down your whole set, Mr. Burning Bush!
They're not turning to slok, they're turning slok to themselves.&quot;</P>
<P>He breaks into wild laughter, snaps his tail
again, and the three of you are standing in a small pine forest in a
dirtdigger deck beneath a holoed blue sky inhaling the odors of
growing things. &quot;Lo, they have created a garden in your
wilderness,&quot; Satan says, doubling over with laughter as the old
man's face purples with rage. Another crack of the tail and you are
floating above a grand promenade in a particularly brilliant
amusement deck: restaurants in gold, sapphire, and silver, diamond
tables drifting on null-g plates, gypsy dancers twirling weightless
in the air, rosy fountains, sparkling music, and the smell of
carnival. &quot;And a city of light in your everlasting darkness.&quot;</P>
<P>Yet another snap of the tail and the three of you
are drifting in the center of the Trek, surrounded by the great
concourse of bright ships, under the aurora of the hydrogen
interface. Satan holds out his palm to the old man. &quot;Does this
look as if they're going to give up, Mr. Have No Others Before Me?
All they'll ever need, and all from pure slok! They can go on
forever. Cross my palm with silver, Mr. Creator of All He Surveys.
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command.&quot;</P>
<P>The old man's face turns from purple to black.
Fire shoots out of his nostrils. The hairs of his beard curl and
uncurl with a furious electrical crackle. &quot;For I am a god of
vengeance and wrath,&quot; he roars, &quot;and I am going to smite
them hip and thigh.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You're wasting your dingo act on <I>me,
</I>cobber,&quot; Satan drawls, puffing out lavender smoke rings.
&quot;They've got you by the short hairs.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, have they, sonny? Wait till they get to
their next Ultima Thule!&quot; The old man snaps his fingers with a
peal of thunder and the three of you are standing in a forest of
immensely tall and stately trees with iridescent green bark and huge
sail-like leaves at their crown that roll and snap ponderously in the
wind. A thick carpet of brownish mosslike grass covers the cool
forest floor, punctuated with red, blue, yellow, and purple fans of
flowery fungi. Feathered yellow and orange monkey-size bipeds leap
from leaf to leaf high overhead, and fat little purplish balls of fur
roll about the brownish grass nibbling on the fungi. The air smells
of cinnamon and apples, and the slight overrich-ness.of oxygen makes
you pleasantly lightheaded.</P>
<P>&quot;Let me guess,&quot; Satan sighs, sucking
languidly on the tip of his tail.</P>
<P>&quot;Turn to slok!&quot; the old man bellows, and
his shout is thunder that rends the sky and the forest crystallizes
and shatters to dust and the brownish grass hardens to rock and the
feathered bipeds and purplish furballs decompress and explode and you
are standing on a plain of mean brown rock streaked with green under
a blue-black sky soiled with green clouds, and the air reeks of
chlorine.</P>
<P>&quot;You're slipping, Mr. You Were,&quot; Satan
says. &quot;They don't need your gardens any more, for theirs is the
power and the glory forever, amen.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, is it?&quot; the old man says, grinning.
&quot;They don't need the old Master of the Universe any more, do
they? You've been the Prince of Liars too long, sonny. You don't
understand how these jerks have been programmed. For thus have I set
them one against the other and each against himself. It's the oldest
trick in the book.&quot;</P>
<P>He snaps his fingers and the three of you are
pressed up against the outer bulkhead of an amusement deck as a
wild-eyed mob of dirt-diggers surges through it, smashing crystal
tables, toppling fire-sculptures, brandishing crosses wrapped with
simmed grape leaves, and chanting: &quot;No more ships! No more
ships! Soil or death!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They don't need my gardens any more, do
they?&quot; the old man gloats. &quot;I can play their minds like
harpsichords, because I created their universe, outer <I>and </I>inner.&quot;
He snaps his fingers. &quot;Look at your masters of energy and matter
now!&quot;</P>
<P>And you are standing in a corroding dirtdigger
deck breathing sour air. The pine trees are stunted, the grass is
sickly, and the dirtdiggers' eyes are feverish and shiny as they bow
down to the vine-covered cross. &quot;Groveling on their hands and
knees where they belong,&quot; the old man says. &quot;The old guilt
routine, it gets 'em every time.&quot; He snaps his fingers again,
and you are falling through a droptube through the decks of a
well-maintained ship. The air is sweet, the lights clear and bright,
the metallic and jeweled surfaces clean and sparkling, but the
peacock crowds seem ridden with fear, whirling at nothing, jumping at
shadows. &quot;And if the right don't get them, the left hand will,&quot;
the old man says. &quot;Each man is an island, each man stands alone.
What profiteth them if they gain the universe as long as I hold the
mortgage on their souls?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, but what profiteth them if they <I>forsake
</I>your cheapjack housing development and <I>gain </I>their souls?&quot;
Satan says, blowing chains of smoke rings into each passing deck. The
rings of lavender smoke alight on the brows of the people and turn
into silvery bands&mdash;the first full sensory transceivers,
ancestors of the tap. &quot;Behold the tap!&quot; Satan says as the
transceiver bands melt into the skulls of their wearers, becoming the
surgically implanted tap. &quot;The Declaration of Independence from
your stage set, O Producer of Biblical Epics! The bridge between the
islands! The door to realities into which you may not follow! The
crown of creation!&quot;</P>
<P>Satan turns to you as the three of you leave the
droptube in a quiet residential deck: walkways of golden bricks
wandering among gingerbread houses of amethyst, quartz, topaz. He
blows a smoke ring at you which settles on your head and then sinks
into your skull. &quot;What about it, man?&quot; he asks you with a
cock of his head at the old man. &quot;Is Merlin the Magnificent here
the Be-All and End-All, or just another circus act?&quot;</P>
<P>Satan breaks into mad laughter, and then you are
snapping your tail, laughing madly, and blowing lavender puffs of
smoke at the old man, who stares at you with bugging pop eyes.</P>
<P>&quot;Where did he go?&quot; the old man says.</P>
<P>&quot;Allow me to introduce myself,&quot; you say.</P>
<P>&quot;The Lord is not mocked!&quot; the old man
shouts.</P>
<P>&quot;Behold the master of space beyond spaces and
times beyond time,&quot; you say, sucking on the tip of your tail.</P>
<P>You bounce one of the purplish furballs on your
hand under huge iridescent green trees. You stand on the Champs
Elys<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">&eacute;</FONT>es in fair
Paris on lost Earth. You dance in Jofe D'mahl's grand salon and pop a
flasher into your mouth which explodes in a flash of pink velvet that
transforms you into a woman making love to a golden man on black
sands on the shore of a silver lake under blue and orange moons. You
ride a surfboard of emerald light in the curl of a wave a mile high
that rolls across an endless turquoise sea. You soar singing into the
heart of a blue-white sun, burning yet unconsumed.</P>
<P>You are a viewpoint beside Satan and the old man
rising through a lifttube in a torchship transformed. Somber
dirtdigger shorts turn to cloaks of many colors. Trees, ivy, and
flowers sprout from metal deck-plates. Corrosion melts from the
bulkheads of dirtdigger decks, the vine-colored crosses evaporate,
and sour-smelling gloomings become fragrant gardens of delight.</P>
<P>Anger boils through the old man. His red face
dopplers through purple into ultraviolet black as sparks fly from his
gnashing teeth and tiny lightning bolts crackle from his fingertips.
&quot;They've . . . they've . . . they've . . .&quot; He stammers in
blind rage, his eyes rolling thunders.</P>
<P>&quot;They've eaten from the Tree of Creation this
time,&quot; Satan says with a grin. &quot;How do you like <I>them
</I>apples?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;For eating of the Tree of Good and Evil I
drove these drool-headed dreeks from Eden with fire and the sword!&quot;
the old man roars with the voice of a thousand novas. &quot;For <I>this
</I>will I wreak such vengeance as will make all that seem like a
cakewalk through paradise!&quot;</P>
<P>And he explodes in a blinding flash of light, and
now you can see nothing but the starry firmament and an enormous
mushroom pillar cloud of nuclear fire light-years high, roiling,
immense, static, and eternal. &quot;For now I am become the Lord of
Hosts, Breaker of Worlds! Look upon my works, ye mortals, and
despair!&quot;</P>
<P>And you are watching Jofe D'mahl flitting from a
shuttle to the entrance stage of Bela-37. You watch him emerge from a
lift-tube onto the bridge of the scoutship. And you are Jofe D'mahl,
staring back through the plex at the Trek, a disk of diamond
brilliance behind the rainbow gauze of its hydrogen interface. As you
watch, it dwindles slowly to a point of light, one more abstract star
lost in the black immensities of the boundless void.</P>
<P>&quot;Overwhelming, isn't it?&quot; Haris Bandoora
says, moving partially into your field of vision. &quot;A hundred
million stars, perhaps as many planets, and this one galaxy is a
speck of matter floating in an endless nothing. Once we were bits of
some insignificant anomaly called life contaminating a dust-mote
circling a dot of matter lost in the universal void. Now we're not
even that.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We're the part that counts,&quot; you say.</P>
<P>&quot;If only you knew.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Knew what?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I've heard the call, Haris.&quot; Raj Doru,
fever in his fierce brown eyes, has risen to the bridge and walked to
Bandoora's side.</P>
<P>You are standing in a voidbubble on Bela-37's
entrance stage with Haris Bandoora and Raj Doru. Your field of vision
contains nothing but the tiny ship, the abstract stars, the two men,
and an infinity of nothing. You reel with vertigo and nausea before
that awful abyss.</P>
<P>Doru spreads his arms, turns on his g-polarizer,
and leaps up and out into the blackness of the void.</P>
<P>&quot;What's he doing?&quot; you shout.</P>
<P>&quot;Sucking void,&quot; Bandoora says.
&quot;Answering the call. He'll go out far enough to lose sight of
the ship and stay there for a standard day.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What will he do out there?&quot; you ask
softly as Doru disappears into the everlasting night.</P>
<P>&quot;What happens between a man and the void is
between a man and the void.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why do you do it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Each man has his own reason, D'mahl. The
call has many voices. Soon you will hear it in your own language.&quot;</P>
<P>And you are standing on the scoutship's bridge
watching Haris Bandoora himself disappear into that terrible oceanic
immensity.</P>
<P>&quot;Are you hearing the call, Jofe D'mahl?&quot;
says the quiet voice of Areth Lorenzi, the ancient voidsucker now
standing beside you like a fleshly ghost.</P>
<P>&quot;I'm not sure what I'm hearing,&quot; you
say. &quot;Maybe just my own ego. I've got to get a voidsuck on tape,
or I've wasted my time out here.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It's the call,&quot; she says. &quot;It
comes to each of us along his own natural vector.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There's something you people aren't telling
me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There is, but to know, you must first taste
the void.&quot;</P>
<P>You stand in your voidbubble on Bela-37's entrance
stage, knees flexed, looking out into the endless abyss into which
you are about to leap; millions of needlepoint stars prick at your
retinas, and the black silences howl in your ears. You inhale and
dive up and out into the unknown.</P>
<P>And you float in clear black nothingness where the
stars are motes of incandescent matter infinities away across the
empty purity of the abyss. Nothing moves. Nothing changes. No event
transpires. Silence is eternal. Time does not exist.</P>
<P>&quot;What is it that the voidsuckers know?&quot;
you finally say, if only to hear the sound of your own voice. &quot;What
is it that they hear out here in this endless nowhere?&quot;</P>
<P>And an immense and horrid laughter rends the
fabric of space, and the firmament is rent asunder by an enormous
mushroom pillar cloud light-years high that billows and roils and yet
remains changeless, outside of time. &quot;You would know what the
voidsuckers know, would you, vile mortal?&quot; says the voice from
the pillar of nuclear fire. &quot;You would know a truth that would
shrivel your soul to a cinder of slok?&quot;</P>
<P>And the mushroom cloud becomes an old man in a
tattered robe, with long white hair and beard, parsecs tall, so that
his toenails blot out stars and his hands are nebulae. Novas blaze in
his eyes, comets flash from his fingertips, and his visage is wrath,
utter and eternal. &quot;Behold your universe, upright monkey, all
that I now give unto thee, spawn of Adam, and all that shall ever
be!&quot;</P>
<P>You stand on a cliff of black rock under a cruel
actinic sun choking on vacuum. You tread water in an oily yellow sea
that sears your flesh while blue lightnings rend a pale-green sky.
Icy-blue snow swirls around you as you crawl across an endless
fractured plain of ice under a wan red sun. Your bones creak under 4
gs as you try to stand beneath a craggy overhang while the sky beyond
is filthy gray smeared with ugly bands of brown and purple.</P>
<P>&quot;Behold your latest futile hope, wretched
creature!&quot; the voice roars. &quot;Behold Eden, 997-Beta-II!&quot;
And you stand on a crumbling shelf of striated green rock overlooking
a chemically blue sea. The purplish sky is mottled with blue and
greenish clouds and the air sears your lungs as your knees begin to
huckle, your consciousness to fade.</P>
<P>And once more you float in a void sundered by a
galactic mushroom pillar cloud that becomes a ghastly vision of an
old man light-years tall. The utter emptiness of the interstellar
abyss burns with X-ray fire from the black holes of his eyes, his
hair and beard are manes of white-hot flame that sear the firmament,
his hands are claws crushing star clusters, his mouth is a scar of
death across the face of the galaxy, and his rage is absolute.</P>
<P>&quot;Slok, stinking microbe!&quot; he howls with
a voice that blasts ten thousand planets from their orbits. &quot;It's
all slok! That's what the voidsuckers know. Lo, I have created a
universe for you that goes on forever, time and space without end.
And in all that creation, one garden where life abounded, one Earth,
one Eden, and that you have destroyed forever. And all else is
slok&mdash;empty void, poison gas, and dead matter, worlds without
end, time without mercy! Behold my works, mortals, behold your
prison, and despair!&quot;</P>
<P>And his laughter shakes the galaxy and his eyes
are like unto the nether pits of hell.</P>
<P>You shake your head, and you smile. You point your
right forefinger at the ravening colossus. &quot;You're forgetting
something, you lamer,&quot; you say. &quot;I created this reality.
You're not real. Evaporate, you drool-headed dreek!&quot;</P>
<P>And the monstrous old man begins to dissolve into
a huge lavender mist. &quot;I may not be real,&quot; he says, &quot;but
the situation you find yourself in sure is. Talk your way out of that
one!&quot; He disappears, thumbing his nose.</P>
<P>And you are watching Jofe D'mahl, a small figure
in a shiny mirror-suit standing alone in the eternal abyss. He turns
to you, begins to grow, speaks.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;Have thou and I not against fate conspired, 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And seized this sorry scheme of things entire? 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And shaped it closer to the heart's desire?&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>D'mahl's mirrorsuit begins to flash endlessly
through the colors of the spectrum. Lightnings crackle from his
fingertips and auroras halo his body like waves of hydrogen
interfaces. &quot;Let there be light, we have said on the first day,
and there is light.&quot;</P>
<P>You are D'mahl as the entire jeweled glory of two
thousand and forty torchships springs into being around you. &quot;Let
there be heavens, we have said on the second day,&quot; you say, and
you are standing on a meadow of rolling purple hills under a rainbow
sky in a dancing multitude of Trekkers. &quot;And Earth.&quot; And
the multitude is transported to <I>Erewhon, </I>where the dirtdiggers
have combined three whole decks and created a forest of towering
pines and lordly oaks under an azure sky.</P>
<P>&quot;Let there be matter and energy without end,
we have said on the third day,&quot; you say, and you feel the power
flowing through your body as you straddle a naked torchtube, as you
become the torch you are riding. &quot;And there is matter and energy
everlasting.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And now on the fourth day, we have rested,&quot;
you say, floating in the void. &quot;And contemplated that which we
have not made. And found it devoid of life or meaning, and hopelessly
lame.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And on the fifth day,&quot; D'mahl says as
you watch him standing in the blackness in his suit of many lights,
&quot;we shall give up the things of childhood&mdash;gods and demons,
planets and suns, guilts and regrets.&quot;</P>
<P>D'mahl is standing in front of a huge shimmer
screen overlooking the grass and forest of a dirtdigger deck. &quot;And
on the sixth day, shall we not say, let there be life? And shall
there not be life?&quot;</P>
<P>Bears, cows, unicorns, horses, dogs, lions,
giraffes, red velvety kan-garoolike creatures, hippos, elephants,
tigers, buffalo, mice, hummingbirds, shrews, rabbits, geese, zebras,
goats, monkeys, winged dragons, tapirs, eagles come tumbling,
soaring, and gamboling out of the shimmer screen to fill the forest
and meadow with their music.</P>
<P>And you are D'mahl, feeling the power of the torch
pour through your body, flash from your fingertips, as you stand in
the center of the Trek, awash in light and life and motion, saying:
&quot;And on the seventh day, shall we not say, let us be fruitful
and multiply and fill the dead and infinite reaches of the void with
ships and life and meaning?&quot;</P>
<P>And you stretch out your arms and torchships
explode into being around you as the Trek opens like an enormous
blossoming mandala, filling the blackness of the abyss with itself,
immense, forever unfolding, and eternal. &quot;And shall not that day
be without end?&quot;</P>
