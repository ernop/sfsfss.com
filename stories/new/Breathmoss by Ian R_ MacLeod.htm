            <P align=justify></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>In her twelfth standard year, which on 
            Habara was the Season of Soft Rains, Jalila moved across the 
            mountains with her mothers from the high plains of Tabuthal to the 
            coast. For all of them, the journey down was one of unhurried 
            discovery, with the kamasheens long gone and the world freshly 
            moist, and the hayawans rusting as they rode them, the huge flat 
            plates of their feet swishing through purplish-green undergrowth. 
            She saw the cliffs and qasrs she’d only visited from her dreamtent, 
            and sailed across the high ridges on ropewalks her distant ancestors 
            had built, which had seemed frail and antique to her in her worried 
            imaginings, but were in fact strong and subtle; huge dripping 
            gantries heaving from the mist like wise giants, softly humming, and 
            welcoming her and her hayawan, whom she called Robin, in cocoons of 
            effortless embrace. Swaying over the drop beyond into grey-green 
            nothing was almost like flying.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>The strangest thing of all in this 
            journey of discoveries was that the landscape actually seemed to 
            rise higher as they descended and encamped and descended again; the 
            sense of <I>up</I> increased, rather than that of down. The air on 
            the high plains of Tabuthal was rarefied–Jalila knew that from her 
            lessons in her dreamtent; they were so close to the stars that Pavo 
            had had to clap a mask over her face from the moment of her birth 
            until the breathmoss was embedded in her lungs. And it had been 
            clear up there, it was always clear, and it was pleasantly cold. The 
            sun shone all day hard and cold and white from the blue blackness, 
            as did a billion stars at night, although Jalila had never thought 
            of those things as she ran amid the crystal trees and her mothers 
            smiled at her and occasionally warned her that, one day, all of this 
            would have to change.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>And now that day was upon her, and 
            this landscape–as Robin, her hayawan, rounded the path through an 
            urrearth forest of alien-looking trees with wrinkled brown trunks 
            and soft green leaves, and the land fell away, and she caught her 
            first glimpse of something far and flat on the horizon–had never 
            seemed so high.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Down on the coast, the mountains 
            reared behind them and around a bay. There were many people here–not 
            the vast numbers, perhaps, of Jalila’s dreamtent stories of the Ten 
            Thousand and One Worlds, but so many that she was sure, as she first 
            walked the streets of a town where the buildings huddled in 
            ridiculous proximity, and tried not to stare at all the faces, that 
            she would never know all their families.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Because of its position at the edge of 
            the mountains, the town was called Al Janb, and, to Jalila’s relief, 
            their new haramlek was some distance away from it, up along a 
            near-unnoticeable dirt track that meandered off from the blue-black 
            serraplated coastal road. There was much to be done there by way of 
            repair, after the long season that her bondmother Lya had left the 
            place deserted. The walls were fused stone, but the structure of the 
            roof had been mostly made from the stuff of the same strange 
            urrearth trees that grew up the mountains, and in many places it had 
            sagged and leaked and grown back toward the chaos that seemed to 
            want to encompass everything here. The hayawans, too, needed much 
            attention in their makeshift stables as they adapted to this new 
            climate, and mother Pavo was long employed constructing the 
            necessary potions to mend the bleeding bonds of rusty metal and 
            flesh, and then to counteract the mold that grew like slow tears 
            across their long, solemn faces. Jalila would normally have been in 
            anguish to think of the sufferings that this new climate was 
            visiting on Robin, but she was too busy feeling ill herself to care. 
            Ridiculously, seeing as there was so much more oxygen to breathe in 
            this rich coastal air, every lungful became a conscious effort, a 
            dreadful physical lunge. Inhaling the damp, salty, spore-laden 
            atmosphere was like sucking soup through a straw. She grew feverish 
            for a while, and suffered the attentions of similar molds to those 
            that were growing over Robin, yet in even more irritating and 
            embarrassing places. More irritating still was the fact that Ananke 
            her birthmother and Lya her bondmother–even Pavo, who was still 
            busily attending to the hayawans–treated her discomforts and fevers 
            with airy disregard. They had, they all assured her vaguely, 
            suffered similarly in their own youths. And the weather would soon 
            change in any case. To Jalila, who had spent all her life in the 
            cool unvarying glare of Tabuthal, where the wind only ever blew from 
            one direction and the trees jingled like ice, that last statement 
            might as well have been spoken in another language.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>If anything, Jalila was sure that she 
            was getting worse. The rain drummed on what there was of the roof of 
            their haramlek, and dripped down and pooled in the makeshift 
            awnings, which burst in bucketloads down your neck if you bumped 
            into them, and the mist drifted in from every direction through the 
            paneless windows, and the mountains, most of the time, seemed to 
            consist of cloud, or to have vanished entirely. She was coughing. 
            Strange stuff was coming out on her hands, slippery and green as the 
            slime that tried to grow everywhere here. One morning, she awoke, 
            sure that part of her was bursting, and stumbled from her dreamtent 
            and out through the scaffolding that had by then surrounded the 
            haramlek, then barefoot down the mud track and across the quiet 
            black road and down onto the beach, for no other reason than that 
            she needed to <I>escape</I>.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>She stood gasping amid the rockpools, 
            her hair lank and her skin feverishly itching. There was something 
            at the back of her throat. There was something in her lungs. She was 
            sure that it had taken root and was growing. Then she started 
            coughing as she had never coughed before, and more of the greenstuff 
            came splattering over her hands and down her chin. She doubled over. 
            Huge lumps of it came showering out, strung with blood. If it hadn’t 
            been mostly green, she’d have been sure that it <I>was</I> her 
            lungs. She’d never imagined anything so agonizing. Finally, though, 
            in heaves and starts and false dawns, the process dwindled. She 
            wiped her hands on her night-dress. The rocks all around her were 
            splattered green. It was breathmoss; the stuff that had sustained 
            her on the high plains. And <I>now</I> look at it! Jalila took a 
            slow, cautious breath. And then another. Her throat ached. Her head 
            was throbbing. But still, the process was suddenly almost 
            ridiculously easy. She picked her way back across the beach, up 
            through the mists to her haramlek. Her mothers were eating 
            breakfast. Jalila sat down with them, wordlessly, and started to 
            eat.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>That night, Ananke came and sat with 
            Jalila as she lay in her dreamtent in plain darkness and tried not 
            to listen to the sounds of the rain falling on and through the 
            creaking, dripping building. Even now, her birthmother’s hands 
            smelled and felt like the high desert as they touched her face. 
            Rough and clean and warm, like rocks in starlight, giving off their 
            heat. A few months before, Jalila would probably have started 
            crying.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"You’ll understand now, perhaps, why 
            we thought it better not to tell you about the breathmoss. . . 
            ?"</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>There was a question mark at the end 
            of the sentence, but Jalila ignored it. They’d known all along! She 
            was still angry.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"And there are other things, too, 
            which will soon start to happen to your body. Things that are 
            nothing to do with this place. And I shall now tell you about them 
            all, even though you’ll say you knew it before. . . . "</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>The smooth, rough fingers stroked her 
            hair. As Ananke’s words unraveled, telling Jalila of changings and 
            swellings and growths she’d never thought would really apply to 
            <I>her, </I>and which these fetid lowlands really seemed to have 
            brought closer, Jalila thought of the sound of the wind, tinkling 
            through the crystal trees up on Tabuthal. She thought of the dry 
            cold wind in her face. The wet air here seemed to enclose her. She 
            wished that she was running. She wanted to escape.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Small though Al Janb was, it was as 
            big a town as Jalila had ever seen, and she soon came to volunteer 
            to run all the various errands that her mothers required as they 
            restored and repaired their haramlek. She was used to wide expanses, 
            big horizons, the surprises of a giant landscape that crept upon you 
            slowly, visible for miles. Yet here, every turn brought abrupt 
            surprise and sudden change. The people had such varied faces and 
            accents. They hung their washing across the streets, and bickered 
            and smoked in public. Some ate with both hands. They stared at you 
            as you went past, and didn’t seem to mind if you stared back at 
            them. There were unfamiliar sights and smells, markets that erupted 
            on particular days to the workings of no calendar Jalila yet 
            understood, and which sold, in glittering, shining, stinking, 
            disgusting, fascinating arrays, the strangest and most wonderful 
            things. There were fruits from off-planet, spices shaped like 
            insects, and insects that you crushed for their spice. There were 
            swarming vats of things Jalila couldn’t possibly imagine any use 
            for, and bright silks woven thin as starlit wind that she longed for 
            with an acute physical thirst. And there were aliens, too, to be 
            glimpsed sometimes wandering the streets of Al Janb, or looking down 
            at you from its overhung top windows like odd pictures in old 
            frames. Some of them carried their own atmosphere around with them 
            in bubbling hookahs, and some rolled around in huge grey bits of the 
            sea of their own planets, like babies in a birthsac. Some of them 
            looked like huge versions of the spice insects, and the air around 
            them buzzed angrily if you got too close. The only thing they had in 
            common was that they seemed blithely unaware of Jalila as she stared 
            and followed them, and then returned inexcusably late from whatever 
            errand she’d supposedly been sent on. Sometimes, she forgot her 
            errands entirely.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"You must learn to get <I>used</I> to 
            things. . . . " Lya her bondmother said to her with genuine 
            irritation late one afternoon, when she’d come back without the tool 
            she’d been sent to get early that morning, or even any recollection 
            of its name or function. "This or any other world will never be a 
            home to you if you let every single thing <I>surprise</I> you. . . . 
            " But Jalila didn’t mind the surprises; in fact, she was coming to 
            enjoy them, and the next time the need arose to visit Al Janb to buy 
            a new growth-crystal for the scaffolding, she begged to be allowed 
            to go, and her mothers finally relented, although with many a 
            warning shake of the head.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>The rain had stopped at last, or at 
            least held back for a whole day, although everything still looked 
            green and wet to Jalila as she walked along the coastal road toward 
            the ragged tumble of Al Janb. She understood, at least in theory, 
            that the rain would probably return, and then relent, and then come 
            back again, but in a decreasing pattern, much as the heat was 
            gradually <I>increasing,</I> although it still seemed ridiculous to 
            her that no one could ever predict exactly how, or when, Habara’s 
            proper Season of Summers would arrive. Those boats she could see 
            now, those fisherwomen out on their feluccas beyond the white bands 
            of breaking waves, their whole lives were dictated by these 
            uncertainties, and the habits of the shoals of whiteback that came 
            and went on the oceans, and which could also only be guessed at in 
            this same approximate way. The world down here on the coast was so 
            <I>unpredictable</I> compared with Tabuthal! The markets, the 
            people, the washing, the sun, the rain, the aliens. Even Hayam and 
            Walah, Habara’s moons, which Jalila was long used to watching, had 
            to drag themselves through cloud like cannonballs though cotton as 
            they pushed and pulled at this ocean. Yet today, as she clambered 
            over the groynes of the long shingle beach that she took as a 
            shortcut to the center of the town when the various tides were out, 
            she saw a particular sight that surprised her more than any 
            other.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>There was a boat, hauled far up from 
            the water, longer and blacker and heavier-looking than the feluccas, 
            with a sort-of ramshackle house at the prow, and a winch at the 
            stern that was so massive that Jalila wondered if it wouldn’t tip 
            the craft over if it ever actually entered the water. But, for all 
            that, it wasn’t the boat that first caught her eye, but the figure 
            who was working on it. Even from a distance, as she struggled to 
            heave some ropes, there was something different about her, and the 
            way she was moving. Another alien? But she was plainly human. And 
            barefoot, in ragged shorts, and bare-breasted. In fact, almost as 
            flat-chested as Jalila still was, and probably of about her age and 
            height. Jalila still wasn’t used to introducing herself to 
            strangers, but she decided that she could at least go over, and 
            pretend an interest in–or an ignorance of–this odd boat.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>The figure dropped another loop of 
            rope over the gunwales with a grunt that carried on the smelly sea 
            breeze. She was brown as tea, with her massy hair hooped back and 
            hanging in a long tail down her back. She was broad-shouldered, and 
            moved in that way that didn’t quite seem wrong, but didn’t seem 
            entirely right either. As if, somewhere across her back, there was 
            an extra joint. When she glanced up at the clatter of shingle as 
            Jalila jumped the last groyne, Jalila got a proper full sight of her 
            face, and saw that she was big-nosed, big-chinned, and that her 
            features were oddly broad and flat. A child sculpting a person out 
            of clay might have done better.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"Have you come to help me?"</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Jalila shrugged. "I might have 
            done."</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"That’s a funny accent you’ve 
            got."</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>They were standing facing each other. 
            She had grey eyes, which looked odd as well. Perhaps she was an 
            off-worlder. That might explain it. Jalila had heard that there were 
            people who had things done to themselves so they could live in 
            different places. She supposed the breathmoss was like that, 
            although she’d never thought of it that way. And she couldn’t quite 
            imagine why it would be a requirement for living on any world that 
            you looked this ugly.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"Everyone talks oddly here," she 
            replied. "But then your accent’s funny as well."</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"I’m Kalal. And that’s just my 
            <I>voice</I>. It’s not an accent." Kalal looked down at her oily 
            hands, perhaps thought about wiping one and offering it to shake, 
            then decided not to bother.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"Oh. . . ?"</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"You don’t get it, do you?" That gruff 
            voice. The odd way her features twisted when she smiled.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"What is there to get? You’re 
            just–"</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"–I’m a man." Kalal picked up a coil 
            of rope from the shingle, and nodded to another beside it. "Well? 
            Are you going to help me with this, or aren’t you?"</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>The rains came again, this time 
            starting as a thing called <I>drizzle,</I> then working up the scale 
            to <I>torrent</I>. The tides washed especially high. There were 
            storms, and white crackles of lightening, and the boom of a wind 
            that was so unlike the kamasheen. Jalila’s mothers told her to be 
            patient, to wait, and to remember–<I>please</I> remember this time, 
            so you don’t waste the day for us all, Jalilaneen–the things that 
            they sent her down the serraplate road to get from Al Janb. She 
            trudged under an umbrella, another new and useless coastal object, 
            which turned itself inside out so many times that she ended up 
            throwing it into the sea, where it floated off quite happily, as if 
            that was the element for which it was intended in the first place. 
            Almost all of the feluccas were drawn up on the far side of the 
            roadway, safe from the madly bashing waves, but there was no sign of 
            that bigger craft belonging to Kalal. Perhaps he–the antique 
            genderative word <I>was</I> he, wasn’t it?–was out there, where the 
            clouds rumbled like boulders. Perhaps she’d imagined their whole 
            encounter entirely.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Arriving back home at the haramlek 
            surprisingly quickly, and carrying for once the things she’d been 
            ordered to get, Jalila dried herself off and buried herself in her 
            dreamtent, trying to find out from it all that she could about these 
            creatures called <I>men</I>. Like so many things about life at this 
            awkward, interesting, difficult time, men were something Jalila 
            would have insisted she definitely already knew about a few months 
            before up on Tabuthal. Now, she wasn’t so sure. Kalal, despite his 
            ugliness and his funny rough-squeaky voice and his slightly odd 
            smell, looked little like the hairy-faced werewolf figures of her 
            childhood stories, and seemed to have no particular need to shout or 
            fight, to carry her off to his rancid cave, or to start collecting 
            odd and pointless things that he would then try to give her. There 
            had once, Jalila’s dreamtent told her, for obscure biological 
            reasons she didn’t quite follow, been far more men in the universe; 
            almost as many as there had been women. Obviously, they had 
            dwindled. She then checked on the word <I>rape,</I> to make sure it 
            really was the thing she’d imagined, shuddered, but nevertheless 
            investigated in full holographic detail the bits of himself that 
            Kalal had kept hidden beneath his shorts as she’d helped stow those 
            ropes. She couldn’t help feeling sorry for him. It was all so 
            pointless and ugly. Had his birth been an accident? A curse? She 
            began to grow sleepy. The subject was starting to bore her. The last 
            thing she remembered learning was that Kalal wasn’t a proper man at 
            all, but a <I>boy</I>–a half-formed thing; the equivalent to 
            girl–another old urrearth word. Then sleep drifted over her, and she 
            was back with the starlight and the crystal trees of Tabuthal, and 
            wondering as she danced with her own reflection which of them was 
            changing.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>By next morning, the sun was shining 
            as if she would never stop. As Jalila stepped out onto the newly 
            formed patio, she gave the blazing light the same sort of an 
            appraising <I>what-are-you-up-to-now</I> glare that her mothers gave 
            her when she returned from Al Janb. The sun had done this trick 
            before of seeming permanent, then vanishing by lunchtime into sodden 
            murk, but today her brilliance continued. As it did the day after. 
            And the day after that. Half a month later, even Jalila was 
            convinced that the Season of Summers on Habara had finally 
            arrived.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>The flowers went mad, as did the 
            insects. There were colors everywhere, pulsing before your eyes, 
            swarming down the cliffs toward the sea, which lay flat and placid 
            and salt-rimed, like a huge animal, basking. It remained mostly cool 
            in Jalila’s dreamtent, and the haramlek by now was a place of tall 
            malqaf windtowers and flashing fans and well-like depths, but 
            stepping outside beyond the striped shade of the mashrabiyas at 
            midday felt like being hit repeatedly across the head with a hot 
            iron pan. The horizons had drawn back; the mountains, after a few 
            last rumbles of thunder and mist, as if they were clearing their 
            throats, had finally announced themselves to the coastline in all 
            their majesty, and climbed up and up in huge stretches of forest 
            into stone limbs that rose and tangled until your eyes grew tired of 
            rising. Above them, finally, was the sky, which was always blue in 
            this season; the blue color of flame. Even at midnight, you caught 
            the flash and swirl of flame.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Jalila learned to follow the advice of 
            her mothers, and to change her daily habits to suit the imperious 
            demands of this incredible, fussy, and demanding weather. If you 
            woke early, and then drank lots of water, and bowed twice in the 
            direction of Al’Toman while she was still a pinprick in the west, 
            you could catch the day by surprise, when dew lay on the stones and 
            pillars, and the air felt soft and silky as the arms of the ghostly 
            women who sometimes visited Jalila’s nights. Then there was 
            breakfast, and the time of work, and the time of study, and Ananke 
            and Pavo would quiz Jalila to ensure that she was following the 
            prescribed Orders of Knowledge. By midday, though, the shadows had 
            drawn back and every trace of moisture had evaporated, and your head 
            swarmed with flies. You sought your own company, and didn’t even 
            want <I>that, </I>and wished, as you tossed and sweated in your 
            dreamtent, for frost and darkness. Once or twice, just to prove to 
            herself that it could be done, Jalila had tried walking to Al Janb 
            at this time, although of course everything was shut and the whole 
            place wobbled and stank in the heat like rancid jelly. She returned 
            to the haramlek gritty and sweaty, almost crawling, and with a 
            pounding ache in her head.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>By evening, when the proper order of 
            the world had righted itself, and Al’Toman would have hung in the 
            east if the mountains hadn’t swallowed her, and the heat, which 
            never vanished, had assumed a smoother, more manageable quality, 
            Jalila’s mothers were once again hungry for company, and for food 
            and for argument. These evenings, perhaps, were the best of all the 
            times that Jalila could remember of her early life on the coast of 
            Habara’s single great ocean, at that stage in her development from 
            child to adult when the only thing of permanence seemed to be the 
            existence of endless, fascinating change. <I>How</I> they argued! 
            Lya, her bondmother, and the oldest of her parents, who wore her 
            grey hair loose as cobwebs with the pride of her age, and waved her 
            arms as she talked and drank, wreathed in endless curls of smoke. 
            Little Pavo, her face smooth as a carved nutmeg, with her small, 
            precise hands, and who knew so much but rarely said anything with 
            insistence. And Jalila’s birthmother Ananke, for whom, of her three 
            mothers, Jalila had always felt the deepest, simplest love, who 
            would always touch you before she said anything, and then fix you 
            with her sad and lovely eyes, as if touching and seeing were far 
            more important than any words. Jalila was older now. She joined in 
            with the arguments–of course, she had <I>always</I> joined in, but 
            she cringed to think of the stumbling inanities to which her mothers 
            had previously had to listen, while, now, at last, she had real, 
            proper things to say about life, whole new philosophies that no one 
            else on the Ten Thousand Worlds and One had ever thought of. . . . 
            Most of the time, her mothers listened. Sometimes, they even acted 
            as if they were persuaded by their daughter’s wisdom.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Frequently, there were visitors to 
            these evening gatherings. Up on Tabuthal, visitors had been rare 
            animals, to be fussed over and cherished and only reluctantly 
            released for their onward journey across the black dazzling plains. 
            Down here, where people were nearly as common as stones on the 
            beach, a more relaxed attitude reigned. Sometimes, there were formal 
            invitations that Lya would issue to someone who was <I>this</I> or 
            <I>that</I> in the town, or more often Pavo would come back with a 
            person she had happened to meet as she poked around for lifeforms on 
            the beach, or Ananke would softly suggest a <I>neighbor</I> (another 
            new word and concept to Jalila) might like to <I>pop in </I>(ditto). 
            But Al Janb was still a small town, and the dignitaries generally 
            weren’t that dignified, and Pavo’s beach wanderers were often shy 
            and slight as she was, while <I>neighbor</I> was frequently a 
            synonym for <I>boring. </I>Still, Jalila came to enjoy most kinds of 
            company, if only so that she could hold forth yet more devastatingly 
            on whatever universal theory of life she was currently 
            developing.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>The flutter of lanterns and hands. The 
            slow breath of the sea. Jalila ate stuffed breads and fuul and 
            picked at the mountains of fruit and sucked lemons and sweet blue 
            rutta and waved her fingers. The heavy night insects, glowing with 
            the pollen they had collected, came bumbling toward the lanterns or 
            would alight in their hands. Sometimes, afterward, they walked the 
            shore, and Pavo would show them strange creatures with blurring 
            mouths like wheels, or point to the vast, distant beds of the 
            tideflowers that rose at night to the changes of the tide; silver, 
            crimson, or glowing, their fronds waving through the dark like the 
            beckoning palm trees of islands from storybook seas.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>One guestless night, when they were 
            walking north away from the lights of the town, and Pavo was filling 
            a silver bag for an aquarium she was ostensibly making for Jalila, 
            but in reality for herself, the horizon suddenly cracked and 
            rumbled. Instinctively by now, Jalila glanced overhead, expecting 
            clouds to be covering the coastal haze of stars. But the air was 
            still and clear; the hot dark edge of that blue flame. Across the 
            sea, the rumble and crackle was continuing, accompanied by a glowing 
            pillar of smoke that slowly tottered over the horizon. The night 
            pulsed and flickered. There was a breath of impossibly hot salt air. 
            The pillar, a wobbly finger with a flame-tipped nail, continued 
            climbing skyward. A few geelies rose and fell, clacking and cawing, 
            on the far rocks; black shapes in the darkness.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"It’s the start of the Season of 
            Rockets," Lya said. "I wonder who’ll be coming. . . ?"</FONT></P>

            <P align=justify></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>By now, Jalila had acquired many of 
            her own acquaintances and friends. Young people were relatively 
            scarce amid the long-lived human Habarans, and those who dwelt 
            around Al Janb were continually drawn together and then repulsed 
            from each other like spinning magnets. The elderly mahwagis, who had 
            outlived the need for wives and the company of a haramlek and lived 
            alone, were often more fun, and more reliably eccentric. It was a 
            relief to visit their houses and escape the pettinesses and sexual 
            jealousies that were starting to infect the other girls near to 
            Jalila’s own age. She regarded Kalal similarly–as an escape–and she 
            relished helping him with his boat, and enjoyed their journeys out 
            across the bay, where the wind finally tipped almost cool over the 
            edge of the mountains and lapped the sweat from their 
            faces.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Kalal took Jalila out to see the 
            rocketport one still, hot afternoon. It lay just over the horizon, 
            and was the longest journey they had undertaken. The sails filled 
            with the wind, and the ocean grew almost black, yet somehow 
            transparent, as they hurried over it. Looking down, Jalila believed 
            that she could glimpse the white sliding shapes of the great 
            sea-leviathans who had once dwelt, if local legend was to be 
            believed, in the ruined rock palaces of the qasrs, which she had 
            passed on her journey down from Tabuthal. Growing tired of sunlight, 
            they had swarmed back to the sea that had birthed them, throwing 
            away their jewels and riches, which bubbled below the surface, then 
            rose again under Habara’s twin moons to become the beds of 
            tideflowers. She had gotten that part of the story from Kalal. 
            Unlike most people who lived on the coast, Kalal was interested in 
            Jalila’s life in the starry darkness of Tabuthal, and repaid her 
            with his own tales of the ocean.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>The boat ploughed on, rising, 
            frothing. Blissfully, it was almost cold. Just how far out at sea 
            was this rocketport? Jalila had watched some of the arrivals and 
            departures from the quays at Al Janb, but those journeys took place 
            in sleek sail-less craft with silver doors that looked, as they 
            turned out from the harbor and rose out on stilts from the water, as 
            if they could travel half-way up to the stars on their own. Kalal 
            was squatting at the prow, beyond that ramshackle hut that Jalila 
            now knew contained the pheromones and grapplers that were needed to 
            ensnare the tideflowers that this craft had been built to harvest. 
            The boat bore no name on the prow, yet Kalal had many names for it, 
            which he would occasionally mention without explaining. If there was 
            one thing that was different about Kalal, Jalila had decided, it was 
            this absence of proper talk or explanation. It put many people off, 
            but she had found that most things became apparent if you just hung 
            around him and didn’t ask direct questions.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>People generally pitied Kalal, or 
            stared at him as Jalila still stared at the aliens, or asked him 
            questions that he wouldn’t answer with anything other than a shrug. 
            Now that she knew him better, Jalila was starting to understand just 
            how much he hated such treatment–almost as much, in fact, as he 
            hated being thought of as ordinary. I am a <I>man, </I>you know, 
            he’d still remark sometimes–whenever he felt that Jalila was 
            forgetting. Jalila had never yet risked pointing out that he was in 
            fact a <I>boy</I>. Kalal could be prickly and sensitive if you 
            treated him as if things didn’t matter. It was hard to tell, really, 
            just how much of how he acted was due to his odd sexual identity, 
            and how much was his personality.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>To add to his freakishness, Kalal 
            lived alone with another male–in fact, the only other male in Al 
            Janb–at the far end of the shore cottages, in a birthing 
            relationship that made Kalal term him his <I>father</I>. His name 
            was Ibra, and he looked much more like the males of Jalila’s 
            dreamtent stories. He was taller than almost anyone, and wore a 
            black beard and long colorful robes or strode about bare-chested, 
            and always talked in a thunderously deep voice, as if he were 
            addressing a crowd through a megaphone. Ibra laughed a lot and 
            flashed his teeth through that hairy mask, and clapped people on the 
            back when he asked them how they were, and then stood away and 
            seemed to lose interest before they had answered. He whistled and 
            sang loudly and waved to passers-by while he worked at repairing the 
            feluccas for his living. Ibra had come to this planet when Kalal was 
            a baby, under circumstances that remained perennially vague. He 
            treated Jalila with the same loud and grinning friendship with which 
            he treated everyone, and which seemed like a wall. He was at least 
            as alien as the tube-like creatures who had arrived from the stars 
            with this new Season of Rockets, which had had one of the larger 
            buildings in Al Janb encased in transparent plastics and flooded in 
            a freezing grey goo so they could live in it. Ibra had come around 
            to their haramlek once, on the strength of one of Ananke’s 
            <I>pop</I> <I>in</I> evening invitations. Jalila, who was then 
            nurturing the idea that no intelligence could exist without the 
            desire to acknowledge some higher deity, found her propositions and 
            examples drowned out in a flurry of counter-questions and assertions 
            and odd bits of information that she half-suspected that Ibra, as he 
            drank surprising amounts of virtually undiluted zibib and freckled 
            aniseed spit at her, was making up on the spot. Afterward, as they 
            walked the shore, he drew her apart and laid a heavy hand on her 
            shoulder and confided in his rambling growl how much he’d enjoyed 
            <I>fencing</I> with her. Jalila knew what fencing was, but she 
            didn’t see what it had to do with talking. She wasn’t even sure if 
            she liked Ibra. She certainly didn’t pretend to understand 
            him.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>The sails thrummed and crackled as 
            they headed toward the spaceport. Kalal was absorbed, staring ahead 
            from the prow, the water splashing reflections across his lithe 
            brown body. Jalila had almost grown used to the way he looked. After 
            all, they were both slightly freakish: she, because she came from 
            the mountains; he, because of his sex. And they both liked their own 
            company, and could accept each other into it without distraction 
            during these long periods of silence. One never asked the other what 
            they were thinking. Neither really cared, and they cherished that 
            privacy.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"Look–" Kalal scuttled to the rudder. 
            Jalila hauled back the jib. In wind-crackling silence, they and 
            their nameless and many-named boat tacked toward the 
            spaceport.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>The spaceport was almost like the 
            mountains: when you were close up, it was too big be seen properly. 
            Yet, for all its size, the place was a disappointment; empty and 
            messy, like a huge version of the docks of Al Janb, similarly 
            reeking of oil and refuse, and essentially serving a similar 
            function. The spaceships themselves–if indeed the vast cistern-like 
            objects they saw forever in the distance as they furled the sails 
            and rowed along the maze of oily canals were spaceships–were only a 
            small part of this huge floating complex of islands. Much more of it 
            was taken up by looming berths for the tugs and tankers that 
            placidly chugged from icy pole to equator across the watery expanses 
            of Habara, taking or delivering the supplies that the settlements 
            deemed necessary for civilized life, or collecting the returning 
            fallen bulk cargoes. The tankers were rust-streaked beasts, so huge 
            that they hardly seemed to grow as you approached them, humming and 
            eerily deserted, yet devoid of any apparent intelligence of their 
            own. They didn’t glimpse a single alien at the spaceport. They 
            didn’t even see a human being.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>The journey there, Jalila decided as 
            they finally got the sails up again, had been far more enjoyable and 
            exciting than actually arriving. Heading back toward the sun-pink 
            coastal mountains, which almost felt like home to her now, she was 
            filled with an odd longing that only diminished when she began to 
            make out the lighted dusky buildings of Al Janb. Was this 
            homesickness, she wondered? Or something else?</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>This was the time of Habara’s long 
            summer. This was the Season of Rockets. When she mentioned their 
            trip, Jalila was severely warned by Pavo of the consequences of 
            approaching the spaceport during periods of possible launch, but it 
            went no further than that. Each night now, and deep into the 
            morning, the rockets rumbled at the horizon and climbed upward on 
            those grumpy pillars, bringing to the shore a faint whiff of sulphur 
            and roses, adding to the thunderous heat. And outside at night, if 
            you looked up, you could sometimes see the blazing comet-trails of 
            the returning capsules, which would crash somewhere in the distant 
            seas.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>The beds of tideflowers were growing 
            bigger as well. If you climbed up the sides of the mountains before 
            the morning heat flattened everything, you could look down on those 
            huge, brilliant, and ever-changing carpets, where every pattern and 
            swirl seemed gorgeous and unique. At night, in her dreamtent, Jalila 
            sometimes imagined that she was floating up on them, just as in the 
            oldest of the old stories. She was sailing over a different 
            landscape on a magic carpet, with the cool night desert rising and 
            falling beneath her like a soft sea. She saw distant palaces, and 
            clusters of palms around small and tranquil lakes that flashed the 
            silver of a single moon. And then yet more of this infinite sahara, 
            airy and frosty, flowed through curves and undulations, and grew 
            vast and pinkish in her dreams. Those curves, as she flew over them 
            and began to touch herself, resolved into thighs and breasts. The 
            winds stirring the peaks of the dunes resolved in shuddering 
            breaths.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>This was the time of Habara’s long 
            summer. This was the Season of Rockets.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Robin, Jalila’s hayawan, had by now, 
            under Pavo’s attentions, fully recovered from the change to her 
            environment. The rust had gone from her flanks, the melds with her 
            thinly grey-furred flesh were bloodless and neat. She looked thinner 
            and lighter. She even smelled different. Like the other hayawans, 
            Robin was frisky and bright and brown-eyed now, and didn’t seem to 
            mind the heat, or even Jalila’s forgetful neglect of her. Down on 
            the coast, hayawans were regarded as expensive, uncomfortable, and 
            unreliable, and Jalila and her mothers took a pride in riding across 
            the beach into Al Janb on their huge, flat-footed, and loping 
            mounts, enjoying the stares and the whispers, and the whispering 
            space that opened around them as they hobbled the hayawans in a 
            square. Kalal, typically, was one of the few coastal people who 
            expressed an interest in trying to ride one of them, and Jalila was 
            glad to teach him, showing him the clicks and calls and nudges, the 
            way you took the undulations of the creature’s back as you might the 
            ups and downs of the sea, and when not to walk around their front 
            and rear ends. After her experiences on his boat, the initial rope 
            burns, the cracks on the head and the heaving sickness, she enjoyed 
            the reversal of situations.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>There was a Tabuthal saying about 
            falling off a hayawan ninety-nine times before you learnt to ride, 
            which Kalal disproved by falling off far into triple figures. Jalila 
            chose Lya’s mount Abu for him to ride, because she was the biggest, 
            the most intelligent, and generally the most placid of the beasts 
            unless she felt that something was threatening her, and because Lya, 
            more conscious of looks and protocol down here than the other 
            mothers, rarely rode her. Domestic animals, Jalila had noticed, 
            often took oddly to Kalal when they first saw and scented him, but 
            he had learned the ways of getting around them, and developed a bond 
            and understanding with Abu even while she was still trying to bite 
            his legs. Jalila had made a good choice of riding partners. Both of 
            them, hayawan and human, while proud and aloof, were essentially 
            playful, and never shirked a challenge. While all hayawans had been 
            female throughout all recorded history, Jalila wondered if there 
            wasn’t a little of the male still embedded in Abu’s imperious 
            downward glance.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Now that summer was here, and the 
            afternoons had vanished into the sun’s blank blaze, the best time to 
            go riding was the early morning. North, beyond Al Janb, there were 
            shores and there were saltbeds and there were meadows, there were 
            fences to be leapt, and barking feral dogs as male as Kalal to be 
            taunted, but south, there were rocks and forests, there were tracks 
            that led nowhere, and there were headlands and cliffs that you saw 
            once and could never find again. South, mostly, was the way that 
            they rode.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"What happens if we keep 
            riding?"</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>They were taking their breath on a 
            flatrock shore where a stream, from which they had all drunk, shone 
            in pools on its way to the ocean. The hayawans had squatted down now 
            in the shadows of the cliff and were nodding sleepily, one 
            nictitating membrane after another slipping over their eyes. As soon 
            as they had gotten here and dismounted, Kalal had walked straight 
            down, arms outstretched, into the tideflower-bobbing ocean. Jalila 
            had followed, whooping, feeling tendrils and petals bumping into 
            her. It was like walking through floral soup. Kalal had sunk to his 
            shoulders and started swimming, which was something Jalila still 
            couldn’t quite manage. He splashed around her, taunting, sending up 
            sheets of colored light. They’d stripped from their clothes as they 
            clambered out, and laid them on the hot rocks, where they now 
            steamed like fresh bread.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"This whole continent’s like a huge 
            island," Jalila said in delayed answer to Kalal’s question. "We’d 
            come back to where we started."</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Kalal shook his head. "Oh, you can 
            never do that. . . . "</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"Where would we be, then?"</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"Somewhere slightly different. The 
            tideflowers would have changed, and we wouldn’t be us, either." 
            Kalal wet his finger, and wrote something in naskhi script on the 
            hot, flat stone between them. Jalila thought she recognized the 
            words of a poet, but the beginning had dissolved into the hot air 
            before she could make proper sense of it. Funny, but at home with 
            her mothers, and with their guests, and even with many of the people 
            of her own age, such statements as they had just made would have 
            been the beginning of a long debate. With Kalal, they just seemed to 
            hang there. Kalal, he moved, he passed on. Nothing quite seemed to 
            stick. There was something, somewhere, Jalila thought, lost and 
            empty about him.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>The way he was sitting, she could see 
            most of his genitals, which looked quite jaunty in their little nest 
            of hair; like a small animal. She’d almost gotten as used to the 
            sight of them as she had to the other peculiarities of Kalal’s 
            features. Scratching her nose, picking off some of the petals that 
            still clung to her skin like wet confetti, she felt no particular 
            curiosity. Much more than Kalal’s funny body, Jalila was conscious 
            of her own–especially her growing breasts, which were still somewhat 
            uneven. Would they ever come out right, she wondered, or would she 
            forever be some unlovely oddity, just as Kalal seemingly was? Better 
            not to think of such things. Better to just enjoy the feel the sun 
            baking her shoulders, loosening the curls of her hair.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"Should we turn back?" Kalal asked 
            eventually. "It’s getting hotter. . . . "</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"Why bother with that–if we carry on, 
            we’ll get back to where we started."</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Kalal stood up. "Do you want to 
            bet?"</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>So they rode on, more slowly, uphill 
            through the uncharted forest, where the urrearth trees tangled with 
            the blue fronds of Habara fungus, and the birds were still, and the 
            crackle of the dry undergrowth was the only sound in the air. 
            Eventually, ducking boughs, then walking, dreamily lost and almost 
            ready to turn back, they came to a path, and remounted. The trees 
            fell away, and they found that they were on a clifftop, far, far 
            higher above the winking sea than they could possibly have imagined. 
            Midday heat clapped around them. Ahead, where the cliff stuck out 
            over the ocean like a cupped hand, shimmering and yet solid, was one 
            of the ruined castles or geological features that the sea-leviathans 
            had supposedly deserted before the arrival of people on this 
            planet–a qasr. They rode slowly toward it, their hayawans’ feet 
            thocking in the dust. It looked like a fairy place. Part natural, 
            but roofed and buttressed, with grey-black gables and huge and 
            intricate windows, that flashed with the colors of the sea. Kalal 
            gestured for silence, dismounted from Abu, led his mount back into 
            the shadowed arms of the forest, and flicked the switch in her back 
            that hobbled her.</FONT></P>

            ask questions, followed.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Close to, much of the qasr seemed to 
            be made of a quartz-speckled version of the same fused stone from 
            which Jalila’s haramlek was constructed. But some other bits of it 
            appeared to be natural effusions of the rock. There was a big arched 
            door of sun-bleached and iron-studded oak, reached by a path across 
            the narrowing cliff, but Kalal steered Jalila to the side, and then 
            up and around a bare angle of hot stone that seemed ready at any 
            moment to tilt them down into the distant sea. But the way never 
            quite gave out; there was always another handhold. From the 
            confident manner in which he moved up this near-cliff face, then 
            scrambled across the blistering black tiles of the rooftop beyond, 
            and dropped down into the sudden cool of a narrow passageway, Jalila 
            guessed that Kalal had been to this qasr before. At first, there was 
            little sense of trespass. The place seemed old and empty–a 
            little-visited monument. The ceilings were stained. The corridors 
            were swept with the litter of winter leaves. Here and there along 
            the walls, there were friezes, and long strings of a script which 
            made as little sense to Jalila, in their age and dimness, as that 
            which Kalal had written on the hot rocks.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Then Kalal gestured for Jalila to 
            stop, and she clustered beside him, and they looked down through the 
            intricate stone lattice of a mashrabiya into sunlight. It was plain 
            from the balcony drop beneath them that they were still high up in 
            this qasr. Below, in the central courtyard, somehow shocking after 
            this emptiness, a fountain played in a garden, and water lapped from 
            its lip and ran in steel fingers toward cloistered 
            shadows.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"Someone <I>lives</I> 
here?"</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Kalal mouthed the word <I>tariqua.</I> 
            Somehow, Jalila instantly understood. It all made sense, in this 
            Season of Rockets, even the dim scenes and hieroglyphs carved in the 
            honeyed stones of this fairy castle. Tariquas were merely human, 
            after all, and the spaceport was nearby; they had to live somewhere. 
            Jalila glanced down at her scuffed sandals, suddenly conscious that 
            she hadn’t taken them off–but by then it was too late, and below 
            them and through the mashrabiya a figure had detached herself from 
            the shadows. The tariqua was tall and thin, and black and bent as a 
            burnt-out matchstick. She walked with a cane. Jalila didn’t know 
            what she’d expected–she’d grown older since her first encounter with 
            Kalal, and no longer imagined that she knew about things just 
            because she’d learnt of them in her dreamtent. But still, this 
            tariqua seemed a long way from someone who piloted the impossible 
            distances between the stars, as she moved and clicked slowly around 
            that courtyard fountain, and far older and frailer than anyone 
            Jalila had ever seen. She tended a bush of blue flowers, she touched 
            the fountain’s bubbling stone lip. Her head was ebony bald. Her 
            fingers were charcoal. Her eyes were as white and seemingly blind as 
            the flecks of quartz in the fused stone of this building. Once, 
            though, she seemed to look up toward them. Jalila went cold. Surely 
            it wasn’t possible that she could <I>see</I> them?–and in any event, 
            there was something about the motion of looking up which seemed 
            habitual. As if, like touching the lip of the fountain, and tending 
            that bush, the tariqua always looked up at this moment of the day at 
            that particular point in the stone walls that rose above 
            her.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Jalila followed Kalal further along 
            the corridors, and down stairways and across drops of beautifully 
            clear glass, that hung on nothing far above the prismatic sea. 
            Another glimpse of the tariqua, who was still slowly moving, her 
            neck stretching like an old tortoise as she bent to sniff a flower. 
            In this part of the qasr, there were more definite signs of 
            habitation. Scattered cards and books. A moth-eaten tapestry that 
            billowed from a windowless arch overlooking the sea. Empty coat 
            hangers piled like the bones of insects. An active but clearly 
            little-used chemical toilet. Now that the initial sense of surprise 
            had gone, there was something funny about this mixture of the 
            extraordinary and the everyday. Here, there was a kitchen, and a 
            half-chewed lump of aish on a plate smeared with seeds. To imagine, 
            that you could both travel between the stars <I>and</I> eat bread 
            and tomatoes! Both Kalal and Jalila were red-faced and chuffing now 
            from suppressed hilarity. Down now at the level of the cloisters, 
            hunched in the shade, they studied the tariqua’s stooping back. She 
            really did look like a scrawny tortoise, yanked out of its shell, 
            moving between these bushes. Any moment now, you expected her to 
            start chomping on the leaves. She moved more by touch than by sight. 
            Amid the intricate colors of this courtyard, and the flashing glass 
            windchimes that tinkled in the far archways, as she fumbled 
            sightlessly but occasionally glanced at things with those odd, white 
            eyes, it seemed yet more likely that she was blind, or at least 
            terribly near-sighted. Slowly, Jalila’s hilarity receded, and she 
            began to feel sorry for this old creature who had been aged and 
            withered and wrecked by the strange process of travel between the 
            stars. <I>The Pain of Distance</I>–now, where had that phrase come 
            from?</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Kalal was still puffing his cheeks. 
            His eyes were watering as he ground his fist against his mouth and 
            silently thumped the nearest pillar in agonized hilarity. Then he 
            let out a nasal grunt, which Jalila was sure that the tariqua must 
            have heard. But her stance didn’t alter. It wasn’t so much as if she 
            hadn’t noticed them, but that she already <I>knew</I> that someone 
            was there. There was a sadness and resignation about her movements, 
            the tap of her cane. . . . But Kalal had recovered his equilibrium, 
            and Jalila watched his fingers snake out and enclose a flake of 
            broken paving. Another moment, and it spun out into the sunlit 
            courtyard in an arc so perfect that there was never any doubt that 
            it was going to strike the tariqua smack between her bird-like 
            shoulders. Which it did–but by then they were running, and the 
            tariqua was straightening herself up with that same slow 
            resignation. Just before they bundled themselves up the stairway, 
            Jalila glanced back, and felt a hot bar of light from one of the 
            qasr’s high upper windows stream across her face. The tariqua was 
            looking straight toward her with those blind white eyes. Then Kalal 
            grabbed her hand. Once again, she was running.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Jalila was cross with herself, and 
            cross with Kalal. It wasn’t <I>like</I> her, a voice like a mingled 
            chorus of her three mothers would say, to taunt some poor old 
            mahwagi, even if that mahwagi happened also to be an aged tariqua. 
            But Jalila was young, and life was busy. The voice soon faded. In 
            any case, there was the coming moulid to prepare for.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>The arrangement of festivals, locally, 
            and on Habara as a whole, was always difficult. Habara’s 
            astronomical year was so long that it made no sense to fix the 
            traditional cycle of moulids by it, but at the same time, no one 
            felt comfortable celebrating the same saint or eid in conflicting 
            seasons. Fasting, after all, properly belonged to winter, and no one 
            could quite face their obligations toward the Almighty with quite 
            the same sense of surrender and equanimity in the middle of spring. 
            People’s memories faded, as well, as to how one <I>did</I> a 
            particular saint in autumn, or revered a certain enlightenment in 
            blasting heat that you had previously celebrated by throwing 
            snowballs. Added to this were the logistical problems of catering 
            for the needs of a small and scattered population across a large 
            planet. There were travelling players, fairs, wandering sufis and 
            priests, but they plainly couldn’t be everywhere at once. The end 
            result was that each moulid was fixed locally on Habara, according 
            to a shifting timetable, and after much discussion and many 
            meetings, and rarely happened twice at exactly the same time, or 
            else occurred simultaneously in different places. Lya threw herself 
            into these discussions with the enthusiasm of one who had long been 
            missing such complexities in the lonelier life up on Tabuthal. For 
            the Moulid of First Habitation–which commemorated the time when the 
            Blessed Joanna had arrived on Habara at a site that several 
            different towns claimed, and cast the first urrearth seeds, and 
            lived for five long Habaran years on nothing but tideflowers and 
            starlight, and rode the sea-leviathans across the oceans as if they 
            were hayawans as she waited for her lover Pia–Lya was the leading 
            light in the local organizations at Al Janb, and the rest of her 
            haramlek were expected to follow suit.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>The whole of Al Janb was to be 
            transformed for a day and a night. Jalila helped with the hammering 
            and weaving, and tuning Pavo’s crystals and plants, which would 
            supposedly transform the serraplate road between their haramlek and 
            the town into a glittering tunnel. More in the forefront of Jalila’s 
            mind were those colored silks that came and went at a particular 
            stall in the markets, and which she was sure would look perfect on 
            her. Between the planning and the worries about this or that turning 
            into a disaster, she worked carefully on each of her three mothers 
            in turn; a nudge here, a suggestion there. Turning their thoughts 
            toward accepting this extravagance was a delicate matter, like 
            training a new hayawan to bear the saddle. Of course, there were 
            wild resistances and buckings, but you were patient, you were 
            stronger. You knew what you wanted. You kept to your subject. You 
            returned and returned and returned to it.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>On the day when Ananke finally 
            relented, a worrying wind had struck up, pushing at the soft, 
            half-formed growths that now straggled through the normal weeds 
            along the road into Al Janb like silvered mucus. Pavo was fretting 
            about her creations. Lya’s life was one long meeting. Even Ananke 
            was anxious as they walked into Al Janb, where faulty fresh 
            projections flickered across the buildings and squares like an 
            incipient headache as the sky greyed. Jalila, urging her birthmother 
            on as she paused frustratingly, was sure that the market wouldn’t be 
            there, or that if it was, the stall that sold the windsilks was sure 
            to have sold out–or, even then, that the particular ones she’d set 
            her mind on would have gone. . . .</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>But it was all there. In fact, a whole 
            new supply of windsilks, even more marvelous and colorful, had been 
            imported for this moulid. They blew and lifted like colored smoke. 
            Jalila caught and admired them.</FONT></P><FONT size=3><B></FONT>

            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Jalila turned at the voice. It was Nayra, a girl about a 
            standard year and a half older than her, whose mothers were amongst 
            the richest and most powerful in Al Janb. Nayra herself was both 
            beautiful and intelligent; witty, and sometimes devastatingly cruel. 
            She was generally at the center of things, surrounded by a bickering 
            and admiring crowd of seemingly lesser mortals, which sometimes 
            included Jalila. But today she was alone.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>"You see, Jalila. That crimson. With your hair, your eyes . . 
            . "</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>She held the windsilk across Jalila’s face like a yashmak. It 
            danced around her eyes. It blurred over her shoulders. Jalila would 
            have thought the color too bold. But Nayra’s gaze, which flickered 
            without ever quite leaving Jalila’s, her smoothing hands, told 
            Jalila that it was right for her far better than any mirror could 
            have. And then there was blue–that flame color of the summer night. 
            There were silver clasps, too, to hold these windsilks, which Jalila 
            had never noticed on sale before. The stallkeeper, sensing a desire 
            to purchase that went beyond normal bargaining, drew out more 
            surprises from a chest. <I>Feel! They can only be made in one place, 
            on one planet, in one season. Look! The grubs, they only hatch when 
            they hear the song of a particular bird, which sings only once in 
            its life before it gives up its spirit to the Almighty. . . . 
            </I>And so on. Ananke, seeing that Jalila had found a more 
            interested and willing helper, palmed her far more cash than she’d 
            promised, and left her with a smile and an oddly sad backward 
            glance.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Jalila spend the rest of that grey and windy afternoon with 
            Nayra, choosing clothes and ornaments for the moulid. Bangles for 
            their wrists and ankles. Perhaps–no? yes?–even a small tiara. Bolts 
            of cloth the color of today’s sky bound across her hips to offset 
            the windsilk’s beauty. A jewel still filled with the sapphire light 
            of a distant sun to twinkle at her belly. Nayra, with her dark 
            blonde hair, her light brown eyes, her fine strong hands, which were 
            pale pink beneath the fingernails like the inside of a shell, she 
            hardly needed anything to augment her obvious beauty. But Jalila 
            knew from her endless studies of herself in her dreamtent mirror 
            that <I>she</I> needed to be more careful; the wrong angle, the 
            wrong light, an incipient spot, and whatever effect she was striving 
            for could be so easily ruined. Yet she’d never really cared as much 
            about such things as she did on that windy afternoon, moving through 
            stalls and shops amid the scent of patchouli. To be so much the 
            focus of her own and someone else’s attention! Nayra’s hands, 
            smoothing across her back and shoulders, lifting her hair, cool 
            sweat at her shoulders, the cool slide and rattle of her bangles as 
            she raised her arms. . . .</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>"We could be creatures from a story, Jalila. Let’s imagine 
            I’m Scheherazade." A toss of that lovely hair. Liquid gold. Nayra’s 
            seashell fingers, stirring. "You can be her sister, Dinarzade. . . .

            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Jalila nodded enthusiastically, although Dinarzade had been 
            an unspectacular creature as far as she remembered the tale; there 
            only so that she might waken Scheherazade in the Sultana’s chamber 
            before the first cock crow of morning. But her limbs, her throat, 
            felt strange and soft and heavy. She reminded herself, as she 
            dressed and undressed, of the doll Tabatha she’d once so treasured 
            up on Tabuthal, and had found again recently, and thought for some 
            odd reason of burying. . . .</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>The lifting, the pulling, Nayra’s appraising hands and glance 
            and eyes. This unresisting heaviness. Jalila returned home to her 
            haramlek dazed and drained and happy, and severely out of 
            credit.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>That night, there was another visitor for dinner. She must 
            have taken some sort of carriage to get there, but she came toward 
            their veranda as if she’d walked the entire distance. Jalila, whose 
            head was filled with many things, was putting out the bowls when she 
            heard the murmur of footsteps. The sound was so slow that eventually 
            she noticed it consciously, looked up, and saw a thin, dark figure 
            coming up the sandy path between Pavo’s swaying and newly sculpted 
            bushes. One arm leaned on a cane, and the other strained seekingly 
            forward. In shock, Jalila dropped the bowl she was holding. It 
            seemed to roll around and around on the table forever, slipping 
            playfully out of reach of her fingers before spinning off the edge 
            and shattering into several thousand white pieces.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>"Oh dear," the tariqua said, finally climbing the steps 
            beside the windy trellis, her cane tap-tapping. "Perhaps you’d 
            better go and tell one of your mothers, Jalila."</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Jalila felt breathless. All through that evening, the 
            tariqua’s trachoman white eyes, the scarred and tarry driftwood of 
            her face, seemed to be studying her. Even apart from that odd 
            business of her knowing her name, which she supposed could be 
            explained, Jalila was more and more certain that the tariqua knew 
            that it was she and Kalal who had spied on her and thrown stones at 
            her on that hot day in the qasr. As if that mattered. But somehow, 
            it <I>did</I>, more than it should have done. Amid all this confused 
            thinking, and the silky memories of her afternoon with Nayra, Jalila 
            scarcely noticed the conversation. The weather remained gusty, 
            spinning the lanterns, playing shapes with the shadows, making the 
            tapestries breathe. The tariqua’s voice was as thin as her frame. It 
            carried on the spinning air like the croak of an insect.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>"Perhaps we could walk on the beach, Jalila?"</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>"What?" She jerked as if she’d been abruptly awakened. Her 
            mothers were already clearing things away, and casting odd glances 
            at her. The voice had whispered inside her head, and the tariqua was 
            sitting there, her burnt and splintery arm outstretched, in the 
            hope, Jalila supposed, that she would be helped up from the table. 
            The creature’s robe had fallen back. Her arm looked like a picture 
            Jalila had once seen of a dried cadaver. With an effort, nearly 
            knocking over another bowl, Jalila moved around the billowing table. 
            With an even bigger effort, she placed her own hand into that of the 
            tariqua. She’d expected it to feel leathery, which it did. But it 
            was also hot beyond fever. Terribly, the fingers closed around hers. 
            There was a pause. Then the tariqua got up with surprising 
            swiftness, and reached around for her cane, still holding Jalila’s 
            hand, but without having placed any weight on it. <I>She could have 
            done all that on her own, the old witch,</I> Jalila thought. <I>And 
            she can </I>see,<I> too–look at the way she’s been stuffing herself 
            with kofta all evening, reaching over for figs. . . 
            .</I></FONT></P><FONT size=3></I></FONT>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"What do you know of the stars, 
            Jalila?" the tariqua asked as they walked beside the beach. Pavo’s 
            creations along the road behind them still looked stark and strange 
            and half-formed as they swayed in the wind, like the wavering silver 
            limbs of an upturned insect. The waves came and went, strewing 
            tideflowers far up the strand. Like the tongue of a snake, the 
            tariqua’s cane darted ahead of her.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Jalila shrugged. There were these 
            Gateways, she had always known that. There were these Gateways, and 
            they were the only proper path between the stars, because no one 
            could endure the eons of time that crossing even the tiniest 
            fragment of the Ten Thousand and One Worlds would entail by the 
            ordinary means of traveling from <I>there</I> to 
            <I>here</I>.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"Not, of course," the tariqua was 
            saying, "that people don’t do such things. There are tales, there 
            are always tales, of ghost-ships of sufis drifting for tens of 
            centuries through the black and black. . . . But the wealth, the 
            contact, the <I>community, </I>flows through the Gateways. The 
            Almighty herself provided the means to make them in the Days of 
            Creation, when everything that was and will ever be spilled out into 
            a void so empty that it did not even exist as an emptiness. In those 
            first moments, as warring elements collided, boundaries formed, 
            dimensions were made and disappeared without ever quite dissolving, 
            like the salt tidemarks on those rocks. . . . " As they walked, the 
            tariqua waved her cane. ". . . which the sun and the eons can never 
            quite bake away. These boundaries are called cosmic strings, Jalila, 
            and they have no end. They must form either minute loops, or they 
            must stretch from one end of this universe to the other, and then 
            turn back again, and turn and turn without end."</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Jalila glanced at the brooch the 
            tariqua was wearing, which was of a worm consuming its tail. She 
            knew that the physical distances between the stars were vast, but 
            the tariqua somehow made the distances that she traversed to avoid 
            that journey seem even vaster. . . .</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"You must understand," the tariqua 
            said, "that we tariquas pass through something worse than nothing to 
            get from one side to the other of a Gateway."</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Jalila nodded. She was young, and 
            <I>nothing</I> didn’t sound especially frightening. Still, she 
            sensed that there were the answers to mysteries in this near-blind 
            gaze and whispering voice that she would never get from her 
            dreamtent or her mothers. "But, <I>hanim,</I> what could be worse," 
            she asked dutifully, although she still couldn’t think of the 
            tariqua in terms of a name, and thus simply addressed her with the 
            short honorific, "than sheer emptiness?"</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"Ah, but emptiness is <I>nothing</I>. 
            Imagine, Jalila, passing through <I>everything</I> instead!" The 
            tariqua chuckled, and gazed up at the sky. "But the stars are 
            beautiful, and so is this night. You come, I hear, from Tabuthal. 
            There, the skies must all have been very different."</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Jalila nodded. A brief vision flared 
            over her. The way that up there, on the clearest, coldest nights, 
            you felt as if the stars were all around you. Even now, much though 
            she loved the fetors and astonishments of the coast, she still felt 
            the odd pang of missing something. It was a <I>feeling</I> she 
            missed, as much as the place itself, which she guessed would 
            probably seem bleak and lonely if she returned to it now. It was 
            partly to do, she suspected, with that sense that she was loosing 
            her childhood. It was like being on a ship, on Kalal’s nameless 
            boat, and watching the land recede, and half of you loving the loss, 
            half of you hating it. A war seemed to be going on inside her 
            between these two warring impulses. . . .</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>To her surprise, Jalila realized that 
            she wasn’t just thinking these thoughts, but speaking them, and that 
            the tariqua, walking at her slow pace, the weight of her head 
            bending her spine, her cane whispering a jagged line in the dust as 
            the black rags of her djibbah flapped around her, was listening. 
            Jalila supposed that she, too, had been young once, although that 
            was hard to imagine. The sea frothed and swished. They were at the 
            point in the road now where, gently buzzing and almost out of sight 
            amid the forest, hidden there as if in shame, the tariqua’s caleche 
            lay waiting. It was a small filigree, a thing as old and black and 
            ornate as her brooch. Jalila helped her toward it through the trees. 
            The craft’s door creaked open like an iron gate, then shut behind 
            the tariqua. A few crickets sounded through the night’s heat. Then, 
            with a soft rush, and a static glow like the charge of windsilk 
            brushing flesh, the caleche rose up through the treetops and wafted 
            away.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>The day of the moulid came. It was 
            everything that Jalila expected, although she paid it little 
            attention. The intricate, bowered pathway that Pavo had been working 
            on finally shaped itself to her plans–in fact, it was better than 
            that, and seemed like a beautiful accident. As the skies cleared, 
            the sun shone through prismatic arches. The flowers, which had 
            looked so stunted only the evening before, suddenly unfolded, with 
            petals like beaten brass, and stamens shaped so that the continuing 
            breeze, which Pavo had always claimed to have feared, laughed and 
            whistled and tooted as it passed through them. Walking beneath the 
            archways of flickering shadows, you were assailed by scents and the 
            clashes of small orchestras. But Jalila’s ears were blocked, her 
            eyes were sightless. She, after all, was Dinarzade, and Nayra was 
            Scheherazade of the Thousand and One Nights.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Swirling windsilks, her heart 
            hammering, she strode into Al Janb. Everything seemed to be 
            different today. There were too many sounds and colors. People tried 
            to dance with her, or sell her things. Some of the aliens seemed to 
            have dressed themselves as humans. Some of the humans were most 
            definitely dressed as aliens. Her feet were already blistered and 
            delicate from her new crimson slippers. And there was Nayra, dressed 
            in a silvery serwal and blouse of such devastating simplicity that 
            Jalila felt her heart kick and pause in its beating. Nayra was 
            surrounded by a small storm of her usual admirers. Her eyes took in 
            Jalila as she stood at their edge, then beckoned her to join them. 
            The idea of Dinarzade and Scheherazade, which Jalila had thought was 
            to be their secret, was now shared with everyone. The other girls 
            laughed and clustered around, admiring, joking, touching and 
            stroking bits of her as if she was a hayawan. <I>You of all people, 
            Jalila! And such jewels, such silks . . . </I>Jalila stood 
            half-frozen, her heart still kicking. <I>So, so marvelous! And not 
            at all dowdy. . . . </I>She could have lived many a long and happy 
            life without such compliments.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Thus the day continued. All of them in 
            a crowd, and Jalila feeling both over-dressed and exposed, with 
            these stirring, whispering windsilks that covered and yet mostly 
            seemed to reveal her body. She felt like a child in a ribboned 
            parade, and when one of the old mahwagis even came up and pressed a 
            sticky lump of basbousa into her hand, it was the final indignity. 
            She trudged off alone, and found Kalal and his father Ibra managing 
            a seafront stall beside the swaying masts of the bigger trawlers, 
            around which there was a fair level of purchase and interest. Ibra 
            was enjoying himself, roaring out enticements and laughter in his 
            big, belling voice. At last, they’d gotten around to harvesting some 
            of the tideflowers for which their nameless boat had been designed, 
            and they were selling every sort here, salt-fresh from the 
            ocean.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"Try this one. . . . " Kalal drew 
            Jalila away to the edge of the harbor, where the oiled water flashed 
            below. He had just one tideflower in his hand. It was deep-banded 
            the same crimson and blue as her windsilks. The interior was like 
            the eye of an anemone.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Jalila was flattered. But she 
            hesitated. "I’m not sure about wearing something dead." In any case, 
            she knew she already looked ridiculous. That this would be more of 
            the same.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"It isn’t dead, it’s as alive as you 
            are." Kalal held it closer, against Jalila’s shoulder, toward the 
            top of her breast, smoothing out the windsilks in a way that briefly 
            reminded her of Nayra. "And isn’t this material the dead tissue of 
            some creature or other. . . ?" Still, his hands were smoothing. 
            Jalila thought again of Nayra. Being dressed like a doll. Her 
            nipples started to rise. "And if we take it back to the tideflower 
            beds tomorrow morning, place it down there carefully, it’ll still 
            survive . . . " The tideflower had stuck itself to her now, anyway, 
            beneath the shoulder, its adhesion passing through the thin 
            windsilks, burning briefly as it bound to her flesh. And it 
            <I>was</I> beautiful, even if she wasn’t, and it would have been 
            churlish to refuse. Jalila placed her finger into the tideflower’s 
            center, and felt a soft suction, like the mouth of a baby. Smiling, 
            thanking Kalal, feeling somehow better and more determined, she 
            walked away.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>The day went on. The night came. 
            Fireworks crackled and rumpled, rippling down the slopes of the 
            mountains. The whole of the center of Al Janb was transformed 
            unrecognizably into the set of a play. Young Joanna herself walked 
            the vast avenues of Ghezirah, the island city that lies at the 
            center of all the Ten Thousand and One Worlds, and which grows in 
            much the same way as Pavo’s crystal scaffoldings, but on an 
            inconceivable scale, filled with azure skies, glinting in the dark 
            heavens like a vast diamond. The Blessed Joanna, she was supposedly 
            thinking of a planet that had come to her in a vision as she 
            wandered beside Ghezirah’s palaces; it was a place of fine seas, 
            lost giants, and mysterious natural castles, although Jalila, as she 
            followed in the buffeting, cheering procession, and glanced around 
            at the scale of the projections that briefly covered Al Janb’s 
            ordinary buildings, wondered why, even if this version of Ghezirah 
            was fake and thin, Joanna would ever have wanted to leave 
            <I>that</I> city to come to a place such as this.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>There were more fireworks. As they 
            rattled, a deeper sound swept over them in a moan from the sea, and 
            everyone looked up as sunglow poured through the gaudy images of 
            Ghezirah that still clad Al Janb’s buildings. Not one rocket, or 
            two, but three, were all climbing up from the spaceport 
            simultaneously, the vast white plumes of their energies fanning out 
            across half the sky to form a billowy <I>fleur</I> <I>de</I> 
            <I>lys</I>. At last, as she craned her neck and watched the last of 
            those blazing tails diminish, Jalila felt exulted by this moulid. In 
            the main square, the play continued. When she found a place on a 
            bench and began to watch the more intimate parts of the drama 
            unfold, as Joanna’s lover Pia pleaded with her to remain amid the 
            cerulean towers of Ghezirah, a figure moved to sit beside her. To 
            Jalila’s astonishment, it was Nayra.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"That’s a lovely flower. I’ve been 
            meaning to ask you all day . . . " Her fingers moved across Jalila’s 
            shoulder. There was a tug at her skin as she touched the 
            petals.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"I got it from Kalal."</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"Oh . . . " Nayra sought the right 
            word. "<I>Him</I>. Can I smell it. . . ?" She was already bending 
            down, her face close to Jalila’s breast, the golden fall of her hair 
            brushing her forearm, enclosing her in the sweet, slightly vanilla 
            scent of her body. "That’s nice. It smells like the sea–on a clear 
            day, when you climb up and look down at it from the mountains. . . . 
            "</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>The play continued. Would Joanna 
            really go to this planet, which kept appearing to her in these 
            visions? Jalila didn’t know. She didn’t care. Nayra’s hand slipped 
            into her own and lay there upon her thigh with a weight and presence 
            that seemed far heavier than the entire universe. She felt like that 
            doll again. Her breath was pulling, dragging. The play continued, 
            and then, somewhere, somehow, it came to an end. Jalila felt an 
            aching sadness. She’d have been happy for Joanna to continue her 
            will-I-won’t-I agonizing and prayers throughout all of human 
            history, just so that she and Nayra could continue to sit together 
            like this, hand in hand, thigh to thigh, on this hard 
            bench.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>The projections flickered and faded. 
            She stood up in wordless disappointment. The whole square suddenly 
            looked like a wastetip, and she felt crumpled and used-up in these 
            sweaty and ridiculous clothes. It was hardly worth looking back 
            toward Nayra to say goodbye. She would, Jalila was sure, have 
            already vanished to rejoin those clucking, chattering friends who 
            surrounded her like a wall.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"Wait!" A hand on her arm. That same 
            vanilla scent. "I’ve heard that your mother Pavo’s displays along 
            the south road are something quite fabulous. . . . " For once, 
            Nayra’s golden gaze as Jalila looked back at her was almost coy, 
            nearly averted. "I was rather hoping you might show me. . . . 
            "</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>The two of them. Walking hand in hand, 
            just like all lovers throughout history. Like Pia and Joanna. Like 
            Romana and Juliet. Like Isabel and Genya. Ghosts of smoke from the 
            rocket plumes that had buttressed the sky hung around them, and the 
            world seemed half-dissolved in the scent of sulphur and roses. An 
            old woman they passed, who was sweeping up discarded kebab sticks 
            and wrappers, made a sign as they passed, and gave them a weary, 
            sad-happy smile. Jalila wasn’t sure what had happened to her 
            slippers, but they and her feet both seemed to have become 
            weightless. If it hadn’t been for the soft sway and pull of Nayra’s 
            arm, Jalila wouldn’t even have been sure that she was moving. 
            <I>People’s feet really </I>don’t<I> touch the ground when they are 
            in love!</I> Here was something else that her dreamtent and her 
            mothers hadn’t told her.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Pavo’s confections of plant and 
            crystal looked marvelous in the hazed and doubled silver shadows of 
            the rising moons. Jalila and Nayra wandered amid them, and the rest 
            of the world felt withdrawn and empty. A breeze was still playing 
            over the rocks and the waves, but the fluting sound had changed. It 
            was one soft pitch, rising, falling. They kissed. Jalila closed her 
            eyes–she couldn’t help it–and trembled. Then they held both hands 
            together and stared at each other, unflinching. Nayra’s bare arms in 
            the moonslight, the curve inside her elbow and the blue trace of a 
            vein: Jalila had never seen anything as beautiful, here in this 
            magical place.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>The stables, where the hayawans were 
            breathing. Jalila spoke to Robin, to Abu. The beasts were sleepy. 
            Their flesh felt cold, their plates were warm, and Nayra seemed a 
            little afraid. There, in the sighing darkness, the clean scent of 
            feed and straw was overlaid with the heat of the hayawans’ bodies 
            and their dung. The place was no longer a ramshackle tent, but solid 
            and dark, another of Pavo’s creations; the stony catacombs of ages. 
            Jalila led Nayra through it, her shoulders brushing pillars, her 
            heart pounding, her slippered feet whispering through spills of 
            straw. To the far corner, where the fine new white bedding lay like 
            depths of cloud. They threw themselves onto it, half-expecting to 
            fall through. But they were floating in straggles of windsilk, held 
            in tangles of their own laughter and limbs.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"Remember." Nayra’s palm on Jalila’s 
            right breast, scrolled like an old print in the geometric moonlight 
            that fell from Walah, and then through the arched stone grid of a 
            murqana that lay above their heads. "I’m Scheherazade. You’re 
            Dinarzade, my sister . . . " The pebble of Jalila’s nipple rising 
            through the windsilk. "That old, old story, Jalila. Can you remember

            poured back. A small dark bead of blood welled at the curve between

            cries and shuddering sighs of the beloved. Patterned moonlight 
            falling through the murqana in a white and dark tapestry across the

            <P align=justify></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>There was no cock-crow when Jalila 
            startled awake. But Walah had vanished, and so had Nayra, and the 
            light of the morning sun came splintering down through the murqana’s 
            hot blue lattice. Sheltering her face with her hands, Jalila looked 
            down at herself, and smiled. The jewel in her belly was all that was 
            left of her costume. She smelled faintly of vanilla, and much of 
            Nayra, and nothing about her flesh seemed quite her own. Moving 
            through the dazzling drizzle, she gathered up the windsilks and 
            other scraps of clothing that had settled into the fleece bedding. 
            She found one of Nayra’s earrings, which was twisted to right angles 
            at the post, and had to smile again. And here was that tideflower, 
            tossed upturned like an old cup into the corner. She touched the 
            tiny scab on her shoulder, then lifted the flower up and inhaled, 
            but caught on her palms only the scents of Nayra. She closed her 
            eyes, feeling the diamond speckles of heat and cold across her body 
            like the ripples of the sea.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>The hayawans barely stirred as she 
            moved out through their stables. Only Robin regarded her, and then 
            incuriously, as she paused to touch the hard grey melds of her flank 
            that she had pressed against the bars of her enclosure. One eye, 
            grey as rocket smoke, opened, then returned to its saharas of 
            dreams. The hayawans, Jalila supposed for the first time, had their 
            own passions, and these were not to be shared with some odd 
            two-legged creatures of another race and planet.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>The morning was still clinging to its 
            freshness, and the road, as she crossed it, was barely warm beneath 
            her feet. Wind-towered Al Janb and the haramlek behind her looked 
            deserted. Even the limbs of the mountains seemed curled in sleepy 
            haze. On this day after the moulid, no one but the geelies was yet 
            stirring. Cawing, they rose and settled in flapping red flocks from 
            the beds of the tideflowers as Jalila scrunched across the hard 
            stones of the beach. Her feet encountered the cool, slick water. She 
            continued walking, wading, until the sea tickled her waist and what 
            remained of the windsilks had spread about in spills of dye. From 
            her cupped hands, she released the tideflower, and watched it float 
            away. She splashed her face. She sunk down to her shoulders as the 
            windsilks dissolved from her, and looked down between her breasts at 
            the glowing jewel that was still stuck in her belly, and plucked it 
            out, and watched it sink; the sea-lantern of a ship, 
            drowning.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Walking back up the beach, wringing 
            the wet from her hair, Jalila noticed a rich green growth standing 
            out amid the sky-filled rockpools and the growths of lichen. Pricked 
            by something resembling Pavo’s curiosity, she scrambled over, and 
            crouched to examine it as the gathering heat of the sun dried her 
            back. She recognized this spot–albeit dimly–from the angle of a band 
            of quartz that glittered and bled blue oxides. This was where she 
            had coughed up her breathmoss in that early Season of Soft Rains. 
            And here it still was, changed but unmistakable–and growing. A small 
            patch here, several larger patches there. Tiny filaments of green, a 
            minute forest, raising its boughs and branches to the 
sun.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>She walked back up toward her 
            haramlek, humming.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
            <P align=center><B><FONT size=3>3.</FONT></B></P>
            <P align=justify></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>The sky was no longer blue. It was no 
            longer white. It had turned to mercury. The rockets rose and rose in 
            dry crackles of summer lightening. The tube-like aliens fled, 
            leaving their strange house of goo-filled windows and pipes still 
            clicking and humming until something burst and the whole structure 
            deflated, and the mess of it leaked across the nearby streets. There 
            were warnings of poisonings and strange epidemics. There were 
            cloggings and stenches of the drains.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Jalila showed the breathmoss to her 
            mothers, who were all intrigued and delighted, although Pavo had of 
            course noticed and categorized the growth long before, while Ananke 
            had to touch the stuff, and left a small brown mark there like the 
            tips of her three fingers, which dried and turned golden over the 
            days that followed. But in this hot season, these evenings when the 
            sun seemed as if it would never vanish, the breathmoss proved 
            surprisingly hardy. . . .</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>After that night of the moulid, Jalila 
            spent several happy days absorbed and alone, turning and smoothing 
            the memory of her love-making with Nayra. Wandering above and 
            beneath the unthinking routines of everyday life, she was like a 
            fine craftsman, spinning silver, shaping sandalwood. The dimples of 
            Nayra’s back. Sweat glinting in the checkered moonlight. That sweet 
            vein in the crook of her beloved’s arm, and the pulse of the blood 
            that had risen from it to the drumbeats of ecstasy. The memory 
            seemed entirely enough to Jalila. She was barely living in the 
            present day. When, perhaps six days after the end of the moulid, 
            Nayra turned up at their doorstep with the ends of her hair chewed 
            wet and her eyes red-rimmed, Jalila had been almost surprised to see 
            her, and then to notice the differences between the real Nayra and 
            the Scheherazade of her memories. Nayra smelled of tears and dust as 
            they embraced; like someone who had arrived from a long, long 
            journey.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"Why didn’t you <I>call</I> me? I’ve 
            been waiting, waiting. . . . "</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Jalila kissed her hair. Her hand 
            traveled beneath a summer shawl to caress Nayra’s back, which felt 
            damp and gritty. She had no idea how to answer her questions. They 
            walked out together that afternoon in the shade of the woods behind 
            the haramlek. The trees had changed in this long, hot season, 
            departing from their urrearth habits to coat their leaves in a waxy 
            substance that smelled medicinal. The shadows of their boughs were 
            chalkmarks and charcoal. All was silent. The urrearth birds had 
            retreated to their summer hibernations until the mists of autumn 
            came to rouse them again. Climbing a scree of stones, they found 
            clusters of them at the back of a cave; feathery bundles amid the 
            dripping rock, seemingly without eyes or beak.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>As they sat at the mouth of that cave, 
            looking down across the heat-trembling bay, sucking the ice and 
            eating the dates that Ananke had insisted they bring with them, 
            Nayra had seemed like a different person than the one Jalila had 
            thought she had known before the day of the moulid. Nayra, too, was 
            human, and not the goddess she had seemed. She had her doubts and 
            worries. She, too, thought that the girls who surrounded her were 
            mostly crass and stupid. She didn’t even believe in her own obvious 
            beauty. She cried a little again, and Jalila hugged her. The hug 
            became a kiss. Soon, dusty and greedy, they were tumbling amid the 
            hot rocks. That evening, back at the haramlek, Nayra was welcomed 
            for dinner by Jalila’s mothers with mint tea and the best china. She 
            was invited to bathe. Jalila sat beside her as they ate figs fresh 
            from distant Ras and the year’s second crop of oranges. She felt 
            happy. At last, life seemed simple. Nayra was now officially her 
            lover, and this love would form the pattern of her days.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Jalila’s life now seemed complete; she 
            believed that she was an adult, and that she talked and spoke and 
            loved and worshipped in an adult way. She still rode out sometimes 
            with Kalal on Robin and Abu, she still laughed or stole things or 
            played games, but she was conscious now that these activities were 
            the sweetmeats of life, pleasing but unnutritous, and the real 
            glories and surprises lay with being with Nayra, and with her 
            mothers, and the life of the haramlek that the two young women 
            talked of founding together one day.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Nayra’s mothers lived on the far side 
            of Al Janb, in a fine tall clifftop palace that was one of the 
            oldest in the town, clad in white stone and filled with intricate 
            courtyards, and a final beautiful tajo that looked down from gardens 
            of tarragon across the whole bay. Jalila greatly enjoyed exploring 
            this haramlek, deciphering the peeling scripts that wound along the 
            cool vaults, and enjoying the company of Nayra’s mothers who, in 
            their wealth and grace and wisdom, often made her own mothers seem 
            like the awkward and recent provincial arrivals that they plainly 
            were. At home, in her own haramlek, the conversations and ideas 
            seemed stale. An awful dream came to Jalila one night. She was her 
            old doll Tabatha, and she really was being buried. The ground she 
            lay in was moist and dank, as if it was still the Season of Soft 
            Rains, and the faces of everyone she knew were clustered around the 
            hole above her, muttering and sighing as her mouth and eyes were 
            inexorably filled with soil.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"Tell me what it was like, when you 
            first fell in love."</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>Jalila had chosen Pavo to ask this 
            question of. Ananke would probably just hug her, while Lya would 
            talk and talk until there was nothing to say.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"I don’t know. Falling in love is like 
            coming home. You can never quite do it for the first 
            time."</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"But in the stories–"</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"–The stories are always written 
            <I>afterward,</I> Jalila."</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>They were walking the luminous shore. 
            It was near midnight, which was now by far the best time of the 
            night or day. But what Pavo had just said sounded wrong; perhaps she 
            hadn’t been the right choice of mother to speak to, after all. 
            Jalila was sure she’d loved Nayra since that day before the moulid 
            of Joanna, although it was true she loved her now in a different 
            way.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"You still don’t think we really will 
            form a haramlek together, do you?"</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"I think that it’s too early to 
            say."</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"You were the last of our three, 
            weren’t you? Lya and Ananke were already together."</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"It was what drew me to them. They 
            seemed so happy and complete. It was also what frightened me and 
            nearly sent me away."</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"But you stayed together, and then 
            there was . . . " This was the part that Jalila still found hardest 
            to acknowledge; the idea that her mothers had a physical, sexual 
            relationship. Sometimes, deep at night, from someone else’s 
            dreamtent, she had heard muffled sighs, the wet slap of flesh. Just 
            like the hayawans, she supposed, there were things about other 
            people’s lives that you could never fully understand, no matter how 
            well you thought you knew them.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>She chose a different tack. "So why 
            did you choose to have me?"</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"Because we wanted to fill the world 
            with something that had never ever existed before. Because we felt 
            selfish. Because we wanted to give ourselves away."</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"Ananke, she actually gave birth to 
            me, didn’t she?"</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"Down here at Al Janb, they’d say we 
            were primitive and mad. Perhaps that was how we wanted to be. But 
            all the machines at the clinics do is try to recreate the conditions 
            of a real human womb–the voices, the movements, the sound of 
            breathing. . . . Without first hearing that Song of Life, no human 
            can ever be happy, so what better way could there be than to hear it 
            naturally?"</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>A flash of that dream-image of herself 
            being buried. "But the birth itself–"</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>"–I think that was something we all 
            underestimated." The tone of Pavo’s voice told Jalila that this was 
            not a subject to be explored on the grounds of mere 
            curiosity.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT size=3>The tideflower beds had solidified. 
            You could walk across them as if they were dry land. Kalal, after

            mountains. Kalal at the prow. Nayra sitting beside her, her arm 
            around her shoulder, hand straying across her breast until Jalila 
            shrugged it away because the heat of their two bodies was

            attempted to interest Nayra in riding a hayawan, but she grew 
            frightened even in the presence of the beasts. In so many ways, in 
            fact, Nayra surprised Jalila with her timidity. Jalila, in these 
            moments of doubt, and as she lay alone in her dreamtent and 
            wondered, would list to herself Nayra’s many assets: her lithe and 
            willing body; the beautiful haramlek of her beautiful mothers; the 
            fact that so many of the other girls now envied and admired her. 
            There were so many things that were good about Nayra.</FONT></P>

            further tidebeds, came to sit with them, his face sweated 
            lantern-red. He and Nayra shared many memories, and now, as the 
            sails pushed on from the hot air off the mountains, they vied to 
            tell Jalila of the surprises and delights of winters in Al Janb. The 
            fogs when you couldn’t see your hand. The intoxicating blue berries 
            that appeared in special hollows through the crust of the snow. The 
            special saint’s days. . . . If Jalila hadn’t known better, she’d 
            have said that Nayra and Kalal were fighting over something more 
            important.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>The beds of tideflowers were vast, luminous, heavy-scented. 
            Red-black clusters of geelies rose and fell here and there in the 
            moonslight. Walking these gaudy carpets was a most strange 
            sensation. The dense interlaces of leaves felt like rubber matting, 
            but sank and bobbed. Jalila and Nayra lit more lanterns and dotted 
            them around a field of huge primrose and orange petals. They sang 
            and staggered and rolled and fell over. Nayra had brought a pipe of 
            kif resin, and the sensation of smoking that and trying to dance was 
            hilarious. Kalal declined, pleading that he had to control the boat 
            on the way back, and picked his way out of sight, disturbing flocks 
            of geelies.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>And so the two girls danced as the twin moons rose. Nayra, 
            twirling silks, her hair fanning, was graceful as Jalila still 
            staggered amid the lapping flowers. As she lifted her arms and rose 
            on tiptoe, bracelets glittering, she had never looked more 
            desirable. Somewhat drunkenly–and slightly reluctantly, because 
            Kalal might return at any moment–Jalila moved forward to embrace 
            her. It was good to hold Nayra, and her mouth tasted like the 
            tideflowers and sucked needily at her own. In fact, the moments of 
            their love had never been sweeter and slower than they were on that 
            night, although, even as Jalila marveled at the shape of Nayra’s 
            breasts and listened to the changed song of her breathing, she felt 
            herself chilling, receding, drawing back, not just from Nayra’s 
            physical presence, but from this small bay beside the small town on 
            the single continent beside Habara’s great and lonely ocean. Jalila 
            felt infinitely sorry for Nayra as she brought her to her little 
            ecstasies and they kissed and rolled across the beds of flowers. She 
            felt sorry for Nayra because she was beautiful, and sorry for her 
            because of all her accomplishments, and sorry for her because she 
            would always be happy here amid the slow seasons of this little 
            planet.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Jalila felt sorry for herself as well; sorry because she had 
            thought that she had known love, and because she knew now that it 
            had only been a pretty illusion.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>There was a shifting wind, dry and abrasive, briefly to be 
            welcomed, until it became something to curse and cover your face and 
            close your shutters against.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Of Jalila’s mothers, only Lya seemed at all disappointed by 
            her break from Nayra, no doubt because she had fostered hopes of 
            their union forming a powerful bond between their haramleks, and 
            even she did her best not to show it. Of the outside world, the 
            other young women of Al Janb all professed total disbelief–<I>why if 
            it had been me, I’d never have . . . </I>But soon, they were 
            cherishing the new hope that it might indeed <I>be</I> them. Nayra, 
            to her credit, maintained an extraordinary dignity in the face of 
            the fact that she, of all people, had finally been rejected. She 
            dressed in plain clothes. She spoke and ate simply. Of course, she 
            looked more devastatingly beautiful than ever, and everyone’s eyes 
            were reddened by air-borne grit in any case, so it was impossible to 
            tell how much she had really been crying. Now, as the buildings of 
            Al Janb creaked and the breakers rolled and the wind howled through 
            the teeth of the mountains, Jalila saw the gaudy, seeking and 
            competing creatures who so often surrounded Nayra quite differently. 
            Nayra was not, had never been, in control of them. She was more like 
            the bloody carcass over which, flashing their teeth, their eyes, 
            stretching their limbs, they endlessly fought. Often, riven by a 
            sadness far deeper than she had ever experienced, missing something 
            she couldn’t explain, wandering alone or lying in her dreamtent, 
            Jalila nearly went back to Nayra. . . . But she never 
did.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>This was the Season of Winds, and Jalila was heartily sick of 
            herself and Al Janb, and the girls and the mahwagis and the mothers, 
            and of this changing, buffeting banshee weather that seemed to play 
            with her moods. Sometimes now, the skies were entirely beautiful, 
            strung by the curling multicolored banners of sand that the winds 
            had lifted from distant corners of the continent. There was crimson 
            and there was sapphire. The distant saharas of Jalila’s dreams had 
            come to haunt her. They fell–as the trees tore and the paint 
            stripped from the shutters and what remained of Pavo’s arches 
            collapsed–in an irritating grit that worked its way into all the 
            crevices of your body and every weave of your clothes.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>The tariqua had spoken of the pain of <I>nothing,</I> and 
            then of the pain of <I>everything</I>. At the time, Jalila had 
            understood neither, but now, she felt that she understood the pain 
            of nothing all too well. The product of the combined genes of her 
            three mothers; loving Ananke, ever-curious Pavo, proud and talkative 
            Lya, she had always felt glad to recognize these characteristics 
            mingled in herself, but now she wondered if these traits hadn’t 
            cancelled each other out. She was a null-point, a zero, clumsy and 
            destructive and unloving. She was Jalila, and she walked alone and 
            uncaring through this Season of Winds.</FONT></P>

            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>One morning, the weather was especially harsh. Jalila was 
            alone in the haramlek, although she cared little where she or 
            anywhere else was. A shutter must have come loose somewhere. That 
            often happened now. It had been banging and hammering so long that 
            it began to irritate even her. She climbed stairs and slammed doors 
            over jamming drifts of mica. She flapped back irritably at flapping 
            curtains. Still, the banging went on. Yet all the windows and doors 
            were now secure. She was sure of it. Unless. . . .</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Someone was at the front door. She could see a swirling 
            globular head through the greenish glass mullion. Even though they 
            could surely see her as well, the banging went on. Jalila wondered 
            if she wanted it to be Nayra; after all, this was how she had come 
            to her after the moulid; a sweet and needy human being to drag her 
            out from her dreams. But it was only Kalal. As the door shoved 
            Jalila back, she tried not to look disappointed.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>"You can’t do this with your life!"</FONT></P>

            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>"This–<I>nothing</I>. And then not answering the fucking 
            door. . . . " Kalal prowled the hallway as the door banged back and 
            forth and tapestries flailed, looking for clues as if he was a 
            detective. "Let’s go out."</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Even in this weather, Jalila supposed that she owed it to 
            Robin. Then Kalal had wanted to go north, and she insisted on going 
            south, and was not in any mood for arguing. It was an odd journey, 
            so unlike the ones they’d undertaken in the summer. They wrapped 
            their heads and faces in flapping howlis, and tried to ride mostly 
            in the forest, but the trees whipped and flapped and the raw air 
            still abraded their faces.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>They took lunch down by a flatrock shore, in what amounted to 
            shelter, although there was still little enough of it as the wind 
            eddied about them. This could have been the same spot where they had 
            stopped in summer, but it was hard to tell; the light was so 
            changed, the sky so bruised. Kalal seemed changed, too. His face 
            beneath his howli seemed older, as he tried to eat their aish before 
            the sand-laden air got to it, and his chin looked prickled and 
            abraded. Jalila supposed that this was the same facial growth that 
            his father Ibra was so fond of sporting. She also supposed he must 
            choose to shave his off in the way that some women on some decadent 
            planets were said to shave their legs and armpits.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>"Come a bit closer–" she half-shouted, working her way back 
            into the lee of the bigger rock beside which she was sitting to make 
            room for him. "I want you to tell me what you know about love, 
            Kalal."</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Kalal hunched beside her. For a while, he just continued 
            tearing and chewing bits of aish, with his body pressed against hers 
            as the winds boiled around them, the warmth of their flesh almost 
            meeting. And Jalila wondered if men and women, when their lives and 
            needs had been more closely intertwined, had perhaps known the 
            answer to her question. What <I>was</I> love, after all? It would 
            have been nice to think that, in those dim times of myth, men and 
            women had whispered the answer to that question to each other. . . 
            .</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>She thought then that Kalal hadn’t properly heard her. He was 
            telling her about his father, and a planet he barely remembered, but 
            on which he was born. The sky there had been fractaled gold and 
            turquoise–colors so strange and bright that they came as a delight 
            and a shock each morning. It was a place of many islands, and one 
            great city. His father had been a fisherman and boat-repairer of 
            sorts there as well, although the boats had been much grander than 
            anything you ever saw at Al Janb, and the fish had lived not as 
            single organisms, but as complex shoals that were caught not for 
            their meat, but for their joint minds. Ibra had been approached by a 
            woman from off-world, who had wanted a ship on which she could sail 
            alone around the whole lonely band of the northern oceans. She had 
            told him that she was sick of human company. The planning and the 
            making of the craft was a joy for Ibra, because such a lonely 
            journey had been one that he had long dreamed of making, if ever 
            he’d had the time and money. The ship was his finest-ever creation, 
            and it turned out, as they worked on it, that neither he nor the 
            woman were quite as sick of human company as they had imagined. They 
            fell in love as the keel and the spars grew in the city dockyards 
            and the ship’s mind was nurtured, and as they did so, they slowly 
            re-learned the expressions of sexual need between the male and 
            female.</FONT></P>

            world) set sail together, fully intending to conceive a child in the

            after all, did this tale of dispute and deception have to do with 
            love? And were Kalal and Ibra really fugitives? It would explain 
            quite a lot. Once more, in that familiar welling, she felt sorry for 
            him. Men were such strange, sad creatures; forever fighting, angry, 
            lost. . . .</FONT></P>

            impulse, one of those careless things you do, she took that rough 
            and ugly chin in her hand, turned his face toward hers and kissed 
            him lightly on the lips.</FONT></P>

            size=3>They plodded further on their hayawans. They came eventually 
            to a cliff-edge so high that the sea and sky above and beneath 
            vanished. Jalila already knew what they would see as they made their 
            way along it, but still it was a shock; that qasr, thrust into these 
            teeming ribbons of sand. The winds whooped and howled, and the 
            hayawans raised their heads and howled back at it. In this grinding 
            atmosphere, Jalila could see how the qasrs had been carved over long 
            years from pure natural rock. They dismounted, and struggled 
            bent-backed across the narrowing track toward the qasr’s studded 
            door. Jalila raised her fist and beat on it.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>She glanced back at Kalal, but his face was entirely hidden 
            beneath his hood. Had they always intended to come here? But they 
            had traveled too far to do otherwise now; Robin and Abu were tired 
            and near-blinded; they all needed rest and shelter. She beat on the 
            door again, but the sound was lost in the booming storm. Perhaps the 
            tariqua had left with the last of the Season of Rockets, just as had 
            most of the aliens. Jalila was about to turn away when the door, as 
            if thrown wide by the wind, blasted open. There was no one on the 
            other side, and the hallway beyond was dark as the bottom of a dry 
            well. Robin hoiked her head back and howled and resisted as Jalila 
            hauled her in. Kalal with Abu followed. The door, with a massive 
            drumbeat, hammered itself shut behind them. Of course, it was only 
            some old mechanism of this house, but Jalila felt the hairs on the 
            nape of her neck rise.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>They hobbled the hayawans beside the largest of the scalloped 
            arches, and walked on down the passageway beyond. The wind was still 
            with them, and the shapes of the pillars were like the swirling 
            helixes of sand made solid. It was hard to tell what parts of this 
            place had been made by the hands of women and what was entirely 
            natural. If the qasr had seemed deserted in the heat of summer, it 
            was entirely abandoned now. A scatter of glass windchimes, torn 
            apart by the wind. A few broken plates. Some flapping cobwebs of

            tariqua. She had plainly gone now–the fountain was dry and clogged, 
            the bushes were bare tangles of wire. They walked out beneath the 
            tiled arches, looking around. The wind was like a million voices, 
            rising in ululating chorus. This was a strange and empty place; 
            somehow dangerous. . . . Jalila span around. The tariqua was

            wind-echoing chamber set with blue and white tiles. There were a few 
            rugs and cushions scattered on the floor, but still the sense of 
            abandonment remained. As if, Jalila thought, as the tariqua folded 
            herself on the floor and gestured that they join her, this was her 
            last retreat.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman"

            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>They stepped from their sandals and obeyed. Jalila couldn’t 
            quite remember now whether Kalal had encountered the tariqua on her 
            visit to their haramlek, although it seemed plain from his stares at 
            her, and the way her grey-white gaze returned them, that they knew 
            of each other in some way. Coffee was brewing in the corner, over a 
            tiny blue spirit flame, which, as it fluttered in the many drafts, 
            would have taken hours to heat anything. Yet the spout of the brass 
            pot was steaming. And there were dates, too, and nuts and seeds. The 
            tariqua, apologizing for her inadequacy as a host, nevertheless 
            insisted that they help themselves. And somewhere there was a trough 
            of water, too, for their hayawans, and a basket of acram 
            leaves.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Uneasily, they sipped from their cups, chewed the seeds. 
            Kalal had picked up a chipped lump of old stone and was playing with 
            it nervously. Jalila couldn’t quite see what it was.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>"So," he said, clearing his throat, "you’ve been to and from

            size=3>Kalal swallowed. His lump of old stone clicked the floor. A 
            spindle of wind played chill on Jalila’s neck. Then–she didn’t know 
            how it began–the tariqua was talking of Ghezirah, the great and 
            fabled city that lay at the center of all the Ten Thousand and One 
            Worlds. No one Jalila had ever met or heard of had ever visited 
            Ghezirah, not even Nayra’s mothers–yet this tariqua talked of it as 
            if she knew it well. Before, Jalila had somehow imagined the tariqua 
            trailing from planet to distant planet with dull cargoes of ore and 
            biomass in her ship’s holds. To her mind, Ghezirah had always been 
            more than half-mythical–a place from which a dubious historical 
            figure such as the Blessed Joanna might easily emanate, but 
            certainly not a place composed of solid streets upon which the 
            gnarled and bony feet of this old woman might once have walked. . . 
            .</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Ghezirah . . . she could see it now in her mind, smell the 
            shadowy lobbies, see the ever-climbing curve of its mezzanines and 
            rooftops vanishing into the impossible greens of the Floating Ocean. 
            But every time Jalila’s vision seemed about to solidify, the tariqua 
            said something else that made it tremble and change. And then the 
            tariqua said the strangest thing of all, which was that the City At 
            The End Of All Roads was actually <I>alive</I>. Not alive in the 
            meager sense in which every town has a sort of life, but truly 
            living. The city thought. It grew. It responded. There was no 
            central mind or focus to this consciousness, because Ghezirah 
            <I>itself,</I> its teeming streets and minarets and rivers and 
            caleches and its many millions of lives, was itself the mind. . .

            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Jalila was awestruck, but Kalal seemed unimpressed, and was

            size=3>The way bondmother Lya said her name made Jalila look up. 
            Somewhere in her throat, a wary nerve started ticking. They took 
            their meals inside now, in the central courtyard of the haramlek, 
            which Pavo had provided with a translucent roofing to let in a 
            little of what light there was in the evenings’ skies, and keep out 
            most of the wind. Still, as Jalila took a sip of steaming hibiscus, 
            she was sure that the sand had gotten into something.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman"

            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>In other words, Jalila thought, her gaze traveling across her 
            three mothers, you’ve decided something. And this is how you tell 
            me–by pretending that you’re consulting me. It had been the same 
            with leaving Tabuthal. It was always the same. An old ghost of 
            herself got up at that point, threw down her napkin, stalked off up 
            to her room. But the new Jalila remained seated. She even smiled and 
            tried to look encouraging.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>"We’ve seen so little of this world," Lya continued. "All of 
            us, really. And especially since we had you. It’s been marvelous. 
            But, of course, it’s also been confining. . . . Oh <I>no</I>–" Lya 
            waved the idea away quickly, before anyone could even begin to start 
            thinking it. "–we won’t be leaving our haramlek and Al Janb. There 
            are many things to do. New bonds and friendships have been made. 
            Ananke and I won’t be leaving, anyway. . . . But Pavo . . . " And 
            here Lya, who could never quite stop being the chair of a committee, 
            gave a nod toward her mate. ". . . Pavo here has dec–expressed a

            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Pavo gave her plate a half turn. "By boat seems the best way 
            to explore Habara. With such a big ocean . . . " She turned the 
            plate again, as if to demonstrate.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>"And not just a <I>boat,</I>" Ananke put in encouragingly. "A

            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>"Not alone." Pavo gave another of her flustered smiles. "I’ve

            knowledgeable–"</FONT></P>

            "How can I ever forget it!" All of her mothers’ eyes were on her. 
            Then something broke. She got up and stormed off to her 
            room.</FONT></P>

            size=3>The long ride to the tariqua’s qasr, the swish of the wind, 
            and banging three times on the old oak door. Then hobbling Robin and 
            hurrying through dusty corridors to that tall tiled chamber, and 
            somehow expecting no one to be there, even though Jalila had now 
            come here several times alone.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>But the tariqua was always there. Waiting.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Between them now, there was much to be said.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>"This ant, Jalila, which crawls across this sheet of paper 
            from <I>here</I> to <I>there</I>. She is much like us as we crawl 
            across the surface of this planet. Even if she had the wings some of 
            her kind sprout, just as I have my caleche, it would still be the 
            same." The tiny creature, waving feelers, was plainly lost. A black 
            dot. Jalila understood how it felt. "But say, if we were to fold 
            both sides of the paper together. You see how she moves now. . . ?" 
            The ant, antennae waving, hesitant, at last made the tiny jump. "We 
            can move more quickly from one place to another by not travelling 
            across the distance that separates us from it, but by folding space 
            itself.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>"Imagine now, Jalila, that this universe is not one thing 
            alone, one solitary series of <I>this</I> following <I>that,</I> but 
            an endless branching of potentialities. Such it has been since the 
            Days of Creation, and such it is even now, in the shuffle of that 
            leaf as the wind picks at it, in the rising steam of your coffee. 
            Every moment goes in many ways. Most are poor, half-formed things, 
            the passing thoughts and whims of the Almighty. They hang there and 
            they die, never to be seen again. But others branch as strongly as 
            this path that we find ourselves following. There are universes 
            where you and I have never sat here in this qasr. There are 
            universes where there is no Jalila. . . . Will you get that for me. 
            . . ?"</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>The tariqua was pointing to an old book in a far corner. Its 
            leather was cracked, the wind lifted its pages. As she took it from 
            her, Jalila felt the hot brush of the old woman’s hand.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>"So now, you must imagine that there is not just one sheet of 
            a single universe, but many, as in this book, heaped invisibly above 
            and beside and below the page upon which we find ourselves crawling. 
            In fact . . . " The ant recoiled briefly, sensing the strange heat 
            of the tariqua’s fingers, then settled on the open pages. "You must 
            imagine shelf after shelf, floor upon floor of books, the aisles of 
            an infinite library. And if we are to fold this one page, you see, 
            we or the ant never quite knows what lies on the other side of it. 
            And there may be a tear in that next page as well. It may even be 
            that another version of ourselves has already torn it."</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Despite its worn state, the book looked potentially valuable, 
            hand-written in a beautiful flowing script. Jalila had to wince when 
            the tariqua’s fingers ripped through them. But the ant had vanished 
            now. She was somewhere between the book’s pages. . . .</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman"

            potentiality. So that womankind may pass over the spaces between the 
            stars, every tariqua must experience it." The wind gave an extra 
            lunge, flipping the book shut. Jalila reached forward, but the 
            tariqua, quick for once, was ahead of her. Instead of opening the 
            book to release the ant, she weighed it down with the same chipped 
            old stone with which Kalal had played on his solitary visit to this 
            qasr.</FONT></P>

            size=3>The stone was old, chipped, grey-green. It was inscribed, and 
            had been carved with the closed wings of a beetle. Here was 
            something from a world so impossibly old and distant as to make the 
            book upon which it rested seem fresh and new as an unbudded leaf–a 
            scarab, shaped for the Queens of Egypt.</FONT></P>

            size=3>This was the beginning of the Season of Autumns. The trees 
            were beautiful; the forests were on fire with their leaves. Jalila 
            had been walking with Pavo, enjoying the return of the birdsong, and 
            wondering why it was that this new season felt sad when everything

            been Ananke’s. They walked on. Evening was coming. Their shadows 
            were lengthening. Although the sun was shining and the waves

            in their haramlek, to know that interstellar space truly existed, 
            and then to feel, as the tariqua spoke of Gateways, momentarily like

            size=3>Pavo’s ship was a fine thing. Between the slipways and the 
            old mooring posts, where the red-flapping geelies quarreled over 
            scraps of dying tideflower, it grew and grew. Golden-hulled. Far 
            sleeker and bigger than even the ferries that had once borne Al 
            Janb’s visitors to and from the rocket port, and which now squatted 
            on the shingle nearby, gently rusting. It was the talk of the 
            Season. People came to admire its progress.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>As Jalila watched the spars rise over the clustered roofs of 
            the fisherwomen’s houses, she was reminded of Kalal’s tale of his 
            father and his nameless mother, and that ship that they had made 
            together in the teeming dockyards of that city. Her thoughts 
            blurred. She saw the high balconies of a hotel far bigger than any 
            of Al Janb’s inns and boarding houses. She saw a darker, brighter 
            ocean. Strange flesh upon flesh, with the windows open to the 
            oil-and-salt breeze, the white lace curtains rising, falling. . . 
            .</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>The boat grew, and Jalila visited the tariqua, although back 
            in Al Janb, her thoughts sometimes trailed after Kalal as she 
            wondered how it must be–to be male, like the last dodo, and trapped 
            in some endless state of part-arousal, like a form of nagging worry. 
            Poor Kalal. But his life certainly wasn’t lonely. The first time 
            Jalila noticed him at the center of the excited swarm of girls that 
            once again surrounded Nayra, she’d almost thought that she was 
            seeing things. But the gossip was loud and persistent. Kalal and 
            Nayra were <I>a couple–</I>the phrase normally followed by a 
            scandalized shriek, a hand-covered mouth. Jalila could only guess 
            what the proud mothers of Nayra’s haramlek thought of such a union, 
            but, of course, no one could subscribe to outright prejudice. Kalal 
            was, after all, just another human being. Lightly probing her own 
            mothers’ attitudes, she found the usual condescending tolerance. 
            Having sexual relations with a male would be like smoking kif, or 
            drinking alcohol, or any other form of slightly aberrant adolescent 
            behavior; to be tolerated with easy smiles and sympathy, as long as 
            it didn’t go on for too long. To be treated, in fact, in much the 
            same manner as her mothers were now treating her regular visits to 
            the tariqua.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Jalila came to understand why people thought of the Season of 
            Autumns as a sad time. The chill nights. The morning fogs that 
            shrouded the bay. The leaves, finally falling, piled into rotting 
            heaps. The tideflower beds, also, were dying as the waves pulled and 
            dismantled what remained of their colors, and they drifted to the 
            shores, the flowers bearing the same stench and texture and color as 
            upturned clay. The geelies were dying as well. In the town, to 
            compensate, there was much bunting and celebration for yet another 
            moulid, but to Jalila the brightness seemed feeble–the flame of a 
            match held against winter’s gathering gale. Still, she sometimes 
            wandered the old markets with some of her old curiosity, 
            nostalgically touching the flapping windsilks, studying the faces 
            and nodding at the many she now knew, although her thoughts were 
            often literally light-years away. <I>The Pain of Distance</I>; she 
            could feel it. Inwardly, she was thrilled and afraid. Her mothers 
            and everyone else, caught up in the moulid and Pavo’s coming 
            departure, imagined from her mood that she had now decided to take 
            that voyage with her. She deceived Kalal in much the same 
            way.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>The nights became clearer. Riding back from the qasr one dark 
            evening with the tariqua’s slight voice ringing in her ears, the 
            stars seemed to hover closer around her than at any time since she 
            had left Tabuthal. She could feel the night blossoming, its 
            emptiness and the possibilities spinning out to infinity. She felt 
            both like crying, and like whooping for joy. She had dared to ask 
            the tariqua the question she had long been formulating, and the 
            answer, albeit not entirely yes, had not been no. She talked to 
            Robin as they bobbed along, and the puny yellow smudge of Al Janb 
            drew slowly closer. You must understand, she told her hayawan, that 
            the core of the Almighty is like the empty place between these 
            stars, around which they all revolve. It is <I>there,</I> we know 
            it, but we can never<I> see</I> it. . . . She sang songs from the 
            old saharas about the joy of loneliness, and the loneliness of joy. 
            From here, high up on the gradually descending road that wound its 
            way down toward her haramlek, the horizon was still distant enough 
            for her to see the lights of the rocketport. It was like a huge 
            tidebed, holding out as the season changed. And there at the center 
            of it, rising golden, no longer a stumpy silo-shaped object but 
            somehow beautiful, was the last of the year’s rockets. It would have 
            to rise from Habara before the coming of the Season of 
            Winters.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Her mothers’ anxious faces hurried around her in the

            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>For some reason, they were dressed in their best, most formal 
            robes. Their palms were hennaed and scented. They bustled Jalila out 
            of her gritty clothes, practically washed and dressed her, then 
            flapped themselves down the serraplate road into town, where the 
            processions had already started. Still, they were there in plenty of 
            time to witness the blessing of Pavo’s ship. It was to be called 
            <I>Endeavor,</I> and Pavo and Jalila together smashed the bottle of 
            wine across its prow before it rumbled into the nightblack waters of 
            the harbor with an enormous white splash. Everyone cheered. Pavo 
            hugged Jalila.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>There were more bottles of the same frothy wine available at 
            the party afterward. Lya, with her usual thoroughness, had ordered a 
            huge case of the stuff, although many of the guests remembered the 
            Prophet’s old injunction and avoided imbibing. Ibra, though, was 
            soon even more full of himself than usual, and went around the big 
            marquee with a bottle in each hand, dancing clumsily with anyone who 
            was foolish enough to come near him. Jalila drank a little of the 
            stuff herself. The taste was sweet, but oddly hot and bitter. She 
            filled up another glass.</FONT></P>

            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>"You’re wrong there," Jalila countered primly, although the 
            simple words almost fell over each other as she tried to say them. 
            "It was the spacecraft of Captain Cook. She was one of urrearth’s 
            most famous early explorers."</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>"I thought you were many things," Kalal countered, angry for 
            no apparent reason. "But I never thought you were 
            <I>stupid</I>."</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Jalila watched him walk away. The dance had gathered up its 
            beat. Ibra had retreated to sit, foolishly glum, in a corner, and 
            Nayra had moved to the middle of the floor, her arms raised, 
            bracelets jingling, an opal jewel at her belly, windsilk-draped hips 
            swaying. Jalila watched. Perhaps it was the drink, but for the first 
            time in many a Season, she felt a slight return of that old erotic 
            longing as she watched Nayra swaying. Desire was the strangest of 
            all emotions. It seemed so trivial when you weren’t possessed of it, 
            and yet when you were possessed, it was as if all the secrets of the 
            universe were waiting. . . . Nayra was the focus of all attention 
            now as she swayed amid the crowd, her shoulders glistening. She 
            danced before Jalila, and her languorous eyes fixed her for a moment 
            before she danced on. Now she was dancing with Kalal, and he was 
            swaying with her, her hands laid upon his shoulders, and everyone 
            was clapping. They made a fine couple. But the music was getting 
            louder, and so were people’s voices. Her head was pounding. She left 
            the marquee.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>She welcomed the harshness of the night air, the clear 
            presence of the stars. Even the stench of the rotting tideflowers 
            seemed appropriate as she picked her way across the ropes and 
            slipways of the beach. So much had changed since she had first come 
            here–but mostly what had changed had been herself. Here, its shape 
            unmistakable as rising Walah spread her faint blue light across the 
            ocean, was Kalal’s boat. She sat down on the gunwale. The cold wind 
            bit into her. She heard the crunch of shingle, and imagined it was 
            someone else who was in need of solitude. But the sound grew closer, 
            and then whoever it was sat down on the boat beside her. She didn’t 
            need to look up now. Kalal’s smell was always different, and now he 
            was sweating from the dancing.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>"I thought you were enjoying yourself," she

            size=3>"Oh–I was . . . " The emphasis on the <I>was</I> was

            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>They sat there for a long time, in windy, wave-crashing 
            silence. It was almost like being alone. It was like the old days of 
            their being together.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>"So you’re going, are you?" Kalal asked 
eventually.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman"

            size=3>"I’m sorry," Jalila continued. "I’m sounding just like those

            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman"

            apologizing, I’m sorry I got cross with you about the name of that 
            boat you’ll be going on–the <I>Endeavor</I>. It’s a good

            size=3>Jalila glanced down at the prow, which lay before her in the 
            moonlight, pointing toward the silvered waves. From this angle, and 
            in the old naskhi script that Kalal had used, it took her a moment 
            to work out the craft’s name. Something turned inside 
her.</FONT></P>

            size=3>"Flattered?" Kalal stood up. She couldn’t really see his 
            face, but she suddenly knew that she’d once again said the wrong 
            thing. He waved his hands in an odd shrug, and he seemed for a 
            moment almost ready to lean close to her–to do something 
            unpredictable and violent–but instead, picking up stones and 
            skimming them hard into the agitated waters, he walked 
            away.</FONT></P>

            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Pavo was right. If not about love–which Jalila knew now that 
            she still waited to experience–then at least about the major 
            decisions of your life. There was never quite a beginning to them, 
            although your mind often sought for such a thing.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>When the tariqua’s caleche emerged out of the newly teeming 
            rain one dark evening a week or so after the naming of the 
            <I>Endeavor,</I> and settled itself before the lights of their 
            haramlek, and the old woman herself emerged, somehow still dry, and 
            splashed across the puddled garden while her three mothers flustered 
            about to find the umbrella they should have thought to look for 
            earlier, Jalila still didn’t know what she should be thinking. The 
            four women would, in any case, need to talk alone; Jalila recognized 
            that. For once, after the initial greetings, she was happy to 
            retreat to her dreamtent.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>But her mind was still in turmoil. She was suddenly terrified 
            that her mothers would actually agree to this strange proposition, 
            and then that, out of little more than embarrassment and obligation, 
            the rest of her life would be bound to something that the tariqua 
            called the Church of the Gateway. She knew so little. The tariqua 
            talked only in riddles. She could be a fraud, for all Jalila knew–or 
            a witch, just as Kalal insisted. Thoughts swirled about her like the 
            rain. To make the time disappear, she tried searching the knowledge 
            of her dreamtent. Lying there, listening to the rising sound of her 
            mothers’ voices, which seemed to be studded endlessly with the 
            syllables of her own name, Jalila let the personalities who had 
            guided her through the many Pillars of Wisdom tell her what they 
            knew about the Church of the Gateway.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>She saw the blackness of planetary space, swirled with the 
            mica dots of turning planets. Almost as big as those as she zoomed 
            close to it, yet looking disappointingly like a many-angled version 
            of the rocketport, lay the spacestation, and, within it, the 
            junction that could lead you from <I>here</I> to <I>there</I> 
            without passing across the distance between. A huge rent in the Book 
            of Life, composed of the trapped energies of those things the 
            tariqua called cosmic strings, although they and the Gateway itself 
            were visible as nothing more than a turning ring near to the center 
            of the vast spacestation, where occasionally, as Jalila watched, 
            crafts of all possible shapes would seem to hang, then vanish. The 
            gap she glimpsed inside seemed no darker than that which hung 
            between the stars behind it, but it somehow hurt to stare at it. 
            This, then, was the core of the mystery; something both plain and 
            extraordinary. We crawl across the surface of this universe like 
            ants, and each of these craft, switching through the Gateway’s 
            moment of loss and endless potentiality, is piloted by the will of a 
            tariqua’s conscious intelligence, which must glimpse those choices, 
            then somehow emerge sane and entire at the other end of everything. 
            . . .</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Jalila’s mind returned to the familiar scents and shapes of 
            her dreamtent, and the sounds of the rain. The moment seemed to 
            belong with those of the long-ago Season of Soft Rains. Downstairs, 
            there were no voices. As she climbed out from her dreamtent, warily 
            expecting to find the haramlek leaking and half-finished, Jalila was 
            struck by an idea that the tariqua hadn’t quite made plain to her; 
            that a Gateway must push through <I>time</I> just as easily as it 
            pushes through every other dimension. . . ! But the rooms of the 
            haramlek were finely furnished, and her three mothers and the 
            tariqua were sitting in the rainswept candlelight of the courtyard, 
            waiting.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>With any lesser request, Lya always quizzed Jalila before she 
            would even consider granting it. So as Jalila sat before her mothers 
            and tried not to tremble in their presence, she wondered how she 
            could possibly explain her ignorance of this pure, boundless 
            mystery.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>But Lya simply asked Jalila if this was what she wanted–to be 
            an acolyte of the Church of the Gateway.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman"

            size=3>Jalila waited. Then, not even, <I>are you sure?</I> They’d 
            trusted her less than this when they’d sent her on errands into Al 
            Janb. . . . It was still raining. The evening was starless and dark. 
            Her three mothers, having hugged her, but saying little else, 
            retreated to their own dreamtents and silences, leaving Jalila to 
            say farewell to the tariqua alone. The heat of the old woman’s hand 
            no longer came as a surprise to Jalila as she helped her up from her 
            chair and away from the sheltered courtyard.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman"

            patio at the dripping edge of the night. Wet streamers of wind 
            tugged at them.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>"I know you wish I could tell you more, Jalila–but then,

            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Jalila shook her head. "Will you come with me?"</FONT></P>

            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>"Of course. But you must remember that you can never return 
            to the place you have left." The tariqua fumbled with her clasp, the 
            one of a worm consuming its tail. "I want you to have this." It was 
            made of black ivory, and felt as hot as the old woman’s flesh as 
            Jalila took it. For once, not really caring whether she broke her 
            bones, she gave the small, bird-like woman a hug. She smelled of 
            dust and metal, like an antique box left forgotten on a sunny 
            windowledge. Jalila helped her out down the steps into the rainswept 
            garden.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman"

            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>"Of course . . . there are many arrangements." The tariqua 
            opened the dripping filigree door of her caleche and peered at her 
            with those half-blind eyes. Jalila waited. They had stood too long 
            in the rain already.</FONT></P>

            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Jalila moved warily through the sharded glass of her own and 
            her mothers’ expectations. It was agreed that a message concerning 
            her be sent, endorsed by the full long and ornate formal name of the 
            tariqua, to the body that did indeed call itself the Church of the 
            Gateway. It went by radio pulse to the spacestation in wide solar 
            orbit that received Habara’s rockets, and was then passed on inside 
            a vessel from <I>here</I> to <I>there </I>that was piloted by a 
            tariqua. Not only that, but the message was destined for Ghezirah! 
            Riding Robin up to the cliffs where, in this newly clear autumn air, 
            under grey skies and tearing wet wind, she could finally see the 
            waiting fuselage of that last golden rocket, Jalila felt confused 
            and tiny, huge and mythic. It was agreed though, that for the sake 
            of everyone–and not least Jalila herself, should she change her 
            mind–that the word should remain that she was traveling out around 
            the planet with Pavo on board the <I>Endeavor</I>. In need of 
            something to do when she wasn’t brooding, and waiting for further 
            word from (could it really be?) the sentient city of Ghezirah, 
            Jalila threw herself into the listings and loadings and preparations 
            with convincing enthusiasm.</FONT></P>

            size=3>Then the message finally came: an acknowledgement; an 
            acceptance; a few (far too few, it seemed) particulars of the 
            arrangements and permissions necessary for such a journey. All on 
            less than half a sheet of plain two-dimensional printout.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman"

            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Jalila ate lunch with Kalal and Nayra. She surprised herself 
            and talked gaily at first of singing islands and sea-leviathans, 
            somehow feeling that she was hiding little from her two best friends 
            but the particular details of the journey she was undertaking. But 
            Jalila was struck by the coldness that seemed to lie between these 
            two supposed lovers. Nayra, perhaps sensing from bitter experience 
            that she was once again about to be rejected, seemed near-tearful 
            behind her dazzling smiles and the flirtatious blonde tossings of 
            her hair, while Kalal seemed . . . Jalila had no idea how he seemed, 
            but she couldn’t let it end like this, and concocted some queries 
            about the <I>Endeavor</I> so that she could lead him off alone as 
            they left the bar. Nayra, perhaps fearing something else entirely, 
            was reluctant to leave them.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>"I wonder what it is that we’ve both done to her?" Kalal 
            sighed as they watched her give a final sideways wave, pause, and 
            then turn reluctantly down a sidestreet with a most un-Nayran duck 
            of her lovely head.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>They walked toward the harbor through a pause in the rain, to

            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>"Lovely, isn’t she?" Kalal murmured as they stood looking 
            down at the long deck, then up at the high forest of spars. Pavo, 
            who was developing her acquaintance with the ship’s mind, gave them 
            a wave from the bubble of the forecastle. "How long do you think 
            your journey will take? You should be back by early spring, I 
            calculate, if you get ahead of the icebergs. . . . "</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Jalila fingered the brooch that the tariqua had given her, 
            and which she had taken to wearing at her shoulder in the place 
            where she had once worn the tideflower. It was like black ivory, but 
            set with tiny white specks that loomed at your eyes if you held it 
            close. She had no idea what world it was from, or of the substance 
            of which it was made.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman"

            thing. It’s cold, and there’ll be other Seasons on the ocean. And 
            there’ll be other winters. Well, to be honest, Jalila, I’d been 
            hoping–"</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>"–Look!" Jalila interrupted, suddenly sick of the lie she’d 
            been living. "I’m not going."</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>They turned and were facing each other by the harbor’s edge. 
            Kalal’s strange face twisted into surprise, and then something like 
            delight. Jalila thought that he was looking more and more like his 
            father. "That’s marvelous!" He clasped each of Jalila’s arms and 
            squeezed her hard enough to hurt. "It was rubbish, by the way, what 
            I just said about winters here in Al Janb. They’re the most magical, 
            wonderful season. We’ll have snowball fights together! And when Eid

            size=3>Kalal balled his fists, and Jalila stumbled back, fearing for 
            a moment that this wild, odd creature might actually be about to 
            strike her. But he turned instead, and ran off from the 
            harbor.</FONT></P>

            size=3>Next morning, to no one’s particular surprise, it was once 
            again raining. Jalila felt restless and disturbed after her 
            incomplete exchanges with Kalal. Some time had also passed since the 
            message had been received from Ghezirah, and the few small details 
            it had given of her journey had become vast and complicated and 
            frustrating in their arranging. Despite the weather, she decided to 
            ride out to see the tariqua.</FONT></P><FONT size=3><B></FONT>
            <P><FONT face=Helvetica size=3>Robin’s mood had been almost as odd 
            as her mothers, recently, and she moaned and snickered at Jalila 
            when she entered the stables. Jalila called back to her, and stroked 
            her long nose, trying to ease her agitation. It was only when she 
            went to check the harnesses that she realized that Abu was missing. 
            Lya was in the haramlek, still finishing breakfast. It had to be 
            Kalal who had taken her.</FONT></P><FONT size=3></B></FONT>

            size=3>The swirling serraplated road. The black, dripping trees. The 
            agitated ocean. Robin was starting to rust again. She would need 
            more of Pavo’s attention. But Pavo would soon be gone too. . . . The 
            whole planet was changing, and Jalila didn’t know what to make of 
            anything, least of all what Kalal was up to, although the 
            unasked-for borrowing of a precious mount, even if Abu had been 
            virtually Kalal’s all summer, filled her with a foreboding that was 
            an awkward load, not especially heavy, but difficult to carry or put 
            down; awkward and jagged and painful. Twice, now, he had turned from 
            her and walked away with something unsaid. It felt like the start of 
            some prophecy. . . .</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>The qasr shone jet-black in the teeming rain. The studded 
            door, straining to overcome the swelling damp, burst open more 
            forcefully than usual at Jalila’s third knock, and the air inside 
            swirled dark and empty. No sign of Abu in the place beyond the porch 
            where Kalal would probably have hobbled him, although the floor here 
            seemed muddied and damp, and Robin was agitated. Jalila glanced 
            back, but she and her hayawan had already obscured the possible 
            signs of another’s presence. Unlike Kalal, who seemed to notice many 
            things, she decided that she made a poor detective.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Cold air stuttered down the passageways. Jalila, chilled and 
            watchful, had grown so used to this qasr’s sense of abandonment that 
            it was impossible to tell whether the place was now finally empty. 
            But she feared that it was. Her thoughts and footsteps whispered to 
            her that the tariqua, after ruining her life and playing with her 
            expectations, had simply vanished into a puff of lost 
            potentialities. Already disappointed, angry, she hurried to the 
            high-ceilinged room set with blue and white tiles and found, with no 
            great surprise, that the strewn cushions were cold and damp, the 
            coffee lamp was unlit, and that the book through which that patient 
            ant had crawled was now sprawled in a damp-leafed scatter of torn 
            pages. There was no sign of the scarab. Jalila sat down, and 
            listened to the wind’s howl, the rain’s ticking, wondering for a 
            long time when it was that she had lost the ability to 
            cry.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Finally, she stood up and moved toward the courtyard. It was 
            colder today than it had ever been, and the rain had greyed and 
            thickened. It gelled and dripped from the gutters in the form of 
            something she supposed was called <I>sleet,</I> and which she 
            decided as it splattered down her neck that she would hate forever. 
            It filled the bowl of the fountain with mucus-like slush, and 
            trickled sluggishly along the lines of the drains. The air was full 
            of weepings and howlings. In the corner of the courtyard, there lay 
            a small black heap.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Sprawled half in, half out of the poor shelter of the arched 
            cloisters, more than ever like a flightless bird, the tariqua lay 
            dead. Her clothes were sodden. All the furnace heat had gone from 
            her body, although, on a day such as this, that would take no more 
            than a matter of moments. Jalila glanced up though the sleet toward 
            the black wet stone of the latticed mashrabiya from which she and 
            Kalal had first spied on the old woman, but she was sure now that 
            she was alone. People shrank incredibly when they were dead–even a 
            figure as frail and old as this creature had been. And yet, Jalila 
            found as she tried to move the tariqua’s remains out of the rain, 
            their spiritless bodies grew uncompliant; heavier and stupider than 
            clay. The tariqua’s face rolled up toward her. One side was pushed 
            in almost unrecognizably, and she saw that a nearby nest of ants 
            were swarming over it, busily tunneling out the moisture and 
            nutrition, bearing it across the smeared paving as they stored up 
            for the long winter ahead.</FONT></P>

            size=3>This, for Jalila and her mothers, was the Season of 
            Farewells. It was the Season of Departures.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>There was a small and pretty onion-domed mausoleum on a 
            headland overlooking Al Janb, and the pastures around it were a 
            popular place for picnics and lovers’ trysts in the Season of 
            Summers, although they were scattered with tombstones. It was the 
            ever-reliable Lya who saw to the bathing and shrouding of the 
            tariqua’s body, which was something Jalila could not possibly face, 
            and to the sending out though the null-space between the stars of 
            all the necessary messages. Jalila, who had never been witness to 
            the processes of death before, was astonished at the speed with 
            which everything was arranged. As she stood with the other mourners 
            on a day scarfed with cloud, beside the narrow rectangle of earth 
            within which what remained of the tariqua now lay, she could still 
            hear the wind booming over the empty qasr, feel the uncompliant 
            weight of the old woman’s body, the chill speckle of sleet on her 
            face.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>It seemed as if most of the population of Al Janb had made 
            the journey with the cortege up the narrow road from the town. 
            Hard-handed fisherwomen. Gaudily dressed merchants. Even the few 
            remaining aliens. Nayra was there, too, a beautiful vision of sorrow 
            surrounded by her lesser black acolytes. So was Ibra. So, even, was 
            Kalal. Jalila, who was acknowledged to have known the old woman 
            better than anyone, said a few words that she barely heard herself 
            over the wind. Then a priestess who had flown in specially from Ras 
            pronounced the usual prayers about the soul rising on the arms of 
            Munkar and Nakir, the blue and the black angels. Looking down into 
            the ground, trying hard to think of the Gardens of Delight that the 
            Almighty always promised her stumbling faithful, Jalila could only 
            remember that dream of her own burial: the soil pattering on her 
            face, and everyone she knew looking down at her. The tariqua, in one 
            of her many half-finished tales, had once spoken to her of a world 
            upon which no sun had ever shone, but which was nevertheless warm 
            and bounteous from the core of heat beneath its surface, and where 
            the people were all blind, and moved by touch and sound alone; it 
            was a joyous place, and they were forever singing. Perhaps, and 
            despite all the words of the Prophet, Heaven, too, was a place of 
            warmth and darkness.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>The ceremony was finished. Everyone moved away, each pausing 
            to toss in a damp clod of earth, but leaving the rest of the job to 
            be completed by a dull-minded robotic creature, which Pavo had had 
            to rescue from the attentions of the younger children, who, all 
            though the long Habaran summer, had ridden around on it. Down at 
            their haramlek, Jalila’s mothers had organized a small feast. People 
            wandered the courtyard, and commented admiringly on the many changes 
            and improvements they had made to the place. Amid all this, Ibra 
            seemed subdued–a reluctant presence in his own body–while Kalal was 
            nowhere to be seen at all, although Jalila suspected that, if only 
            for the reasons of penance, he couldn’t be far away.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Of course, there had been shock at the news of the tariqua’s 
            death, and Lya, who had now become the person to whom the town most 
            often turned to resolve its difficulties, had taken the lead in the 
            inquiries that followed. A committee of wisewomen was organized even 
            more quickly than the funeral, and Jalila had been summoned and 
            interrogated. Waiting outside in the cold hallways of Al Janb’s 
            municipal buildings, she’d toyed with the idea of keeping Abu’s 
            disappearance and her suspicions of Kalal out of her story, but Lya 
            and the others had already spoken to him, and he’d admitted to what 
            sounded like everything. He’d ridden to the qasr on Abu to 
            remonstrate with the tariqua. He’d been angry, and his mood had been 
            bad. Somehow, but only lightly, he’d pushed the old woman, and she 
            had fallen badly. Then, he panicked. Kalal bore responsibility for 
            his acts, it was true, but it was accepted that the incident was 
            essentially an accident. Jalila, who had imagined many versions of 
            Kalal’s confrontation with the tariqua, but not a single one that 
            seemed entirely real, had been surprised at how easily the people of 
            Al Janb were willing to absolve him. She wondered if they would have 
            done so quite so easily if Kalal had not been a freak–a man. And 
            then she also wondered, although no one had said a single word to 
            suggest it, just how much she was to blame for all of this 
            herself.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>She left the haramlek from the funeral wake and crossed the 
            road to the beach. Kalal was sitting on the rocks, his back turned 
            to the shore and the mountains. He didn’t look around when she 
            approached and sat down beside him. It was the first time since 
            before the tariqua’s death that they’d been alone.</FONT></P>

            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>The worlds branched in a million different ways. It could all 
            have been different. The tariqua still alive. Jalila and Kalal 
            together, instead of the half-formed thing that the love they had 
            both felt for Nayra had briefly been. They could have taken the 
            <I>Endeavor</I> together and sailed this planet’s seas; Pavo would 
            probably have let them–but when, but where, but how? None of it 
            seemed real. Perhaps the tariqua was right; there are many worlds, 
            but most of them are poor, half-formed things.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Jalila and Kalal sat there for a while longer. The breathmoss 
            lay not far off, darkening and hardening into a carpet of stiff 
            grey. Neither of them noticed it.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>For no other reason than the shift of the tides and the 
            rapidly coming winter, Pavo, Jalila, and Kalal and Ibra all left Al 
            Janb on the same morning. The days before were chaotic in the 
            haramlek. People shouted and looked around for things and grew cross 
            and petty. Jalila was torn between bringing everything and nothing, 
            and after many hours of bag-packing and lip-chewing, decided that it 
            could all be thrown out, and that her time would be better spent 
            down in the stables, with Robin. Abu was there too, of course, and 
            she seemed to sense the imminence of change and departure even more 
            than Jalila’s own hayawan. She had become Kalal’s mount far more 
            than she had ever been Lya’s, and he wouldn’t come to say 
            goodbye.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Jalila stroked the warm felt of the creatures’ noses. Gazing 
            into Abu’s eyes as she gazed back at hers, she remembered their 
            rides out in the heat of summer. Being with Kalal then, although she 
            hadn’t even noticed it, had been the closest she had ever come to 
            loving anyone. On the last night before their departure, Ananke 
            cooked one of her most extravagant dinners, and the four women sat 
            around the heaped extravagance of the table that she’d spent all day 
            preparing, each of them wondering what to say, and regretting how 
            much of these precious last times together they’d wasted. They said 
            a long prayer to the Almighty, and bowed in the direction of 
            Al’Toman. It seemed that, tomorrow, even the two mothers who weren’t 
            leaving Al Janb would be setting out on a new and difficult 
            journey.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Then there came the morning, and the weather obliged with 
            chill sunlight and a wind that pushed hard at their cloaks and 
            nudged the <I>Endeavor</I> away from the harbor even before her 
            sails were set. They all watched her go, the whole town cheering and 
            waving as Pavo waved back, looking smaller and neater and prettier 
            than ever as she receded. Without ceremony, around the corner from 
            the docks, out of sight and glad of the <I>Endeavor’</I>s 
            distraction, Ibra and Kalal were also preparing to leave. At a run, 
            Jalila caught them just as they were starting to shift the hull down 
            the rubbled slipway into the waves. <I>Breathmoss;</I> she noticed 
            that Kalal had kept the name, although she and he stood apart on 
            that final beach and talked as two strangers.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>She shook hands with Ibra. She kissed Kalal lightly on the 
            cheek by leaning stiffly forward, and felt the roughness of his 
            stubble. Then the craft got stuck on the slipway, and they were all 
            heaving to get her moving the last few meters into the ocean, until, 
            suddenly, she was afloat, and Ibra was raising the sails, and Kalal 
            was at the prow, hidden behind the tarpaulined weight of their 
            belongings. Jalila only glimpsed him once more, and by then 
            <I>Breathmoss</I> had turned to meet the stronger currents that 
            swept outside the grey bay. He could have been a 
            figurehead.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Back at the dock, her mothers were pacing, 
anxious.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman"

            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Jalila let them scald her. She <I>was</I> almost late for her 
            own leaving. Although most of the crowds had departed, she’d half 
            expected Nayra to be there. Jalila was momentarily saddened, and 
            then she was glad for her. The silver craft that would take her to 
            the rocketport smelled disappointingly of engine fumes as she 
            clambered into it with the few other women and aliens who were 
            leaving Habara. There was a loud bang as the hatches closed, and 
            then a long wait while nothing seemed to happen, and she could only 
            wave at Lya and Ananke through the thick porthole, smiling and 
            mouthing stupid phrases until her face ached. The ferry bobbed 
            loose, lurched, turned, and angled up. Al Janb was half gone in 
            plumes of white spray already.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Then it came in a huge wave. That feeling of incompleteness, 
            of something vital and unknown left irretrievably behind, which is 
            the beginning of the Pain of Distance that Jalila, as a tariqua, 
            would have to face throughout her long life. A sweat came over her. 
            As she gazed out through the porthole at what little there was to 
            see of Al Janb and the mountains, it slowly resolved itself into one 
            thought. Immense and trivial. Vital and stupid. That scarab. She’d 
            never asked Kalal about it, nor found it at the qasr, and the 
            ancient object turned itself over in her head, sinking, spinning, 
            filling her mind and then dwindling before rising up again as she 
            climbed out, nauseous, from the ferry and crossed the clanging 
            gantries of the spaceport toward the last huge golden craft, which 
            stood steaming in the winter’s air. A murder weapon?–but no, Kalal 
            was no murderer. And, in any case, she was a poor detective. And yet 
            . . .</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>The rockets thrust and rumbled. Pushing back, squeezing her 
            eyeballs. There was no time now to think. Weight on weight, terrible 
            seconds piled on her. Her blood seemed to leave her face. She was a 
            clay-corpse. Vital elements of her senses departed. Then, there was 
            a huge wash of silence. Jalila turned to look through the porthole 
            beside her, and there it was. Mostly blue, and entirely beautiful: 
            Habara, her birth planet. Jalila’s hands rose up without her 
            willing, and her fingers squealed as she touched the glass and tried 
            to trace the shape of the greenish-brown coastline, the rising brown 
            and white of the mountains of that huge single continent that 
            already seemed so small, but of which she knew so little. Jewels 
            seemed to be hanging close before her, twinkling and floating in and 
            out of focus like the hazy stars she couldn’t yet see. They puzzled 
            her for a long time, did these jewels, and they were evasive as fish 
            as she sought them with her weightlessly clumsy fingers. Then Jalila 
            felt the salt break of moisture against her face, and realized what 
            it was.</FONT></P>

            size=3>Jalila had long been expecting the message when it finally 
            came. At only one hundred and twenty standard years, Pavo was still 
            relatively young to die, but she had used her life up at a frantic 
            pace, as if she had always known that her time would be limited. 
            Even though the custom for swift funerals remained on Habara, Jalila 
            was able to use her position as a tariqua to ride the Gateways and 
            return for the service. The weather on the planet of her birth was 
            unpredictable as ever, raining one moment and then sunny the next, 
            even as she took the ferry to Al Janb from the rocketport, and hot 
            and cold winds seemed to strike her face as she stood on the dock’s 
            edge and looked about for her two remaining mothers. They embraced. 
            They led her to their haramlek, which seemed smaller to Jalila each 
            time she visited it, despite the many additions and extensions and 
            improvements they had made, and far closer to Al Janb than the long 
            walk she remembered once taking on those many errands. She wandered 
            the shore after dinner, and searched the twilight for a particular 
            shape and angle of quartz, and the signs of dark growth. But the 
            heights of the Season of Storms on this coastline were ferocious, 
            and nothing as fragile as breathmoss could have survived. She lay 
            sleepless that night in her old room within her dreamtent, breathing 
            the strong, dense, moist atmosphere with difficulty, listening to 
            the sound of the wind and rain.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>She recognized none of the faces but her mothers’ of the 
            people who stood around Pavo’s grave the following morning. Al Janb 
            had seemed so changeless, yet even Nayra had moved on–and Kalal was 
            far away. Time was relentless. Far more than the wind that came in 
            off the bay, it chilled Jalila to the bone. One mother dead, and her 
            two others looking like the mahwagis she supposed they were 
            becoming. <I>The Pain of Distance.</I> More than ever now, and hour 
            by hour and day by day in this life that she had chosen, Jalila knew 
            what the old tariqua had meant. She stepped forward to say a few 
            words. Pavo’s life had been beautiful and complete. She had passed 
            on much knowledge about this planet to all womankind, just as she 
            had once passed on her wisdom to Jalila. The people listened 
            respectfully to Jalila, as if she were a priest. When the prayers 
            were finished and the clods of earth had been tossed and the groups 
            began to move back down the hillside, Jalila remained standing by 
            Pavo’s grave. What looked like the same old part-metal beast came 
            lumbering up, and began to fill in the rest of the hole, lifting and 
            lowering the earth with reverent, childlike care. Just as Jalila had 
            insisted, and despite her mothers’ puzzlement, Pavo’s grave lay 
            right beside the old tariqua’s whom they had buried so long ago. 
            This was a place that she had long avoided, but now that Jalila saw 
            the stone, once raw and brittle, but now smoothed and greyed by rain 
            and wind, she felt none of the expected agony. She traced the 
            complex name, scrolled in naskhi script, which she had once found 
            impossible to remember, but which she had now recited countless 
            times in the ceremonials that the Church of the Gateway demanded of 
            its acolytes. Sometimes, especially in the High Temple at Ghezirah, 
            the damn things could go on for days. Yet not one member of the 
            whole Church had seen fit to come to the simple ceremony of this old 
            woman’s burial. It had hurt her, once, to think that no one from 
            offworld had come to her own funeral. But now she 
            understood.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>About to walk away, Jalila paused, and peered around the back 
            of the gravestone. In the lee of the wind, a soft green patch of 
            life was thriving. She stooped to examine the growth, which was 
            thick and healthy, forming a patch more than the size of her two 
            outstretched hands in this sheltered place. Breathmoss. It must have 
            been here for a long time. Yet who would have thought to bring it? 
            Only Pavo: only Pavo could possibly have known.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>As the gathering of mourners at the haramlek started to peter 
            out, Jalila excused herself and went to Pavo’s quarters. Most of the 
            stuff up here was a mystery to her. There were machines and 
            nutrients and potions beyond anything you’d expect to encounter on 
            such an out-of-the way planet. Things were growing. Objects and data 
            needed developing, tending, cataloging, if Pavo’s legacy was to be 
            maintained. Jalila would have to speak to her mothers. But, for now, 
            she found what she wanted, which was little more than a glass tube 
            with an open end. She pocketed it, and walked back up over the hill 
            to the cemetery, and said another few prayers, and bent down in the 
            lee of the wind behind the old gravestone beside Pavo’s new patch of 
            earth, and managed to remove a small portion of the breathmoss 
            without damaging the rest of it.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>That afternoon, she knew that she would have to ride out. The 
            stables seemed virtually unchanged, and Robin was waiting. She even 
            snickered in recognition of Jalila, and didn’t try to bite her when 
            she came to introduce the saddle. It had been such a long time that 
            the animal’s easy compliance seemed a small miracle. But perhaps 
            this was Pavo again; she could have done something to preserve the 
            recollection of her much-changed mistress in some circuit or synapse 
            of the hayawan’s memory. Snuffling tears, feeling sad and exulted, 
            and also somewhat uncomfortable, Jalila headed south on her hayawan 
            along the old serraplate road, up over the cliffs and beneath the 
            arms of the urrearth forest. The trees seemed different; 
            thicker-leafed. And the birdsong cooed slower and deeper than she 
            remembered. Perhaps, here in Habara, this was some Season other than 
            all of those that she remembered. But the qasr reared as always–out 
            there on the cliff face, and plainly deserted. No one came here now, 
            but, like Robin, the door, at three beats of her fists, 
            remembered.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Such neglect. Such decay. It seemed a dark and empty place. 
            Even before Jalila came across the ancient signs of her own future 
            presence–a twisted coathanger, a chipped plate, a few bleached and 
            rotting cushions, some odd and scattered bits of Gateway technology 
            that had passed beyond malfunction and looked like broken shells–she 
            felt lost and afraid. Perhaps this, at last, was the final moment of 
            knowing that she had warned herself she might have to face on 
            Habara. The Pain of Distance. But at the same time, she knew that 
            she was safe as she crawled across this particular page of her 
            universe, and that when she did finally take a turn beyond the 
            Gateways through which sanity itself could scarcely follow, it would 
            be of her own volition, and as an impossibly old woman. The tariqua. 
            Tending flowers like an old tortoise thrust out of its shell. Here, 
            on a sunny, distant day. There were worse things. There were always 
            worse things. And life was good. For all of this, pain was the price 
            you paid.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>Still, in the courtyard, Jalila felt the cold draft of 
            prescience upon her neck from that lacy mashrabiya where she and 
            Kalal would one day stand. The movement she made as she looked up 
            toward it even reminded her of the old tariqua. Even her eyesight 
            was not as sharp as it had once been. Of course, there were ways 
            around that which could be purchased in the tiered and dizzy markets 
            of Ghezirah, but sometimes it was better to accept a few things as 
            the will of the Almighty. Bowing down, muttering the <I>shahada,</I> 
            Jalila laid the breathmoss upon the shaded stone within the 
            cloister. Sheltered here, she imagined that it would thrive. 
            Mounting Robin, riding from the qasr, she paused once to look back. 
            Perhaps her eyesight really was failing her, for she thought she saw 
            the ancient structure shimmer and change. A beautiful green castle 
            hung above the cliffs, coated entirely in breathmoss; a wonder from 
            a far and distant age. She rode on, humming snatches of the old 
            songs she’d once known so well about love and loss between the 
            stars. Back at the haramlek, her mothers were as anxious as ever to 
            know where she had been. Jalila tried not to smile as she endured 
            their familiar scolding. She longed to hug them. She longed to 
            cry.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>That evening, her last evening before she left Habara, Jalila 
            walked the shore alone again. Somehow, it seemed the place to her 
            where Pavo’s ghost was closest. Jalila could see her mother there 
            now, as darkness welled up from between the rocks; a small, lithe 
            body, always stooping, turning, looking. She tried going toward her; 
            but Pavo’s shadow always flickered shyly away. Still, it seemed to 
            Jalila as if she had been led toward something, for here was the 
            quartz-striped rock from that long-ago Season of the Soft Rains. Of 
            course, there was no breathmoss left, the storms had seen to that, 
            but nevertheless, as she bent down to examine it, Jalila was sure 
            that she could see something beside it, twinkling clear from a 
            rockpool through the fading light. She plunged her hand in. It was a 
            stone, almost as smooth and round as many millions of others on the 
            beach, yet this one was worked and carved. And its color was 
            greenish-grey.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman" 
            size=3>The soapstone scarab, somehow thrust here to this beach by 
            the storms of potentiality that the tariquas of the Church of the 
            Gateway stirred up by their impossible journeyings, although Jalila 
            was pleased to see that it looked considerably less damaged than the 
            object she remembered Kalal turning over and over in his nervous 
            hands as he spoke to her future self. Here at last was the link that 
            would bind her through the pages of destiny, and, for a moment, she 
            hitched her hand back and prepared to throw it so far out into the 
            ocean that it would never be reclaimed. Then her arm relaxed. Out 
            there, all the way across the darkness of the bay, the tideflowers 
            of Habara were glowing.</FONT></P>
            <P align=justify><FONT face="New Century Schoolbook,Times New Roman"
