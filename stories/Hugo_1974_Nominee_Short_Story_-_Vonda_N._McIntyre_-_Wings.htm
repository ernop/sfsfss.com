<BR>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 
<BR><BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long after the last visitors had left the 
temple, after time had begun to pass almost unnoticed in a deep, unrippled 
stream, a shape appeared, far distant, unrecognizable through the thin-film 
watered-silk patterns of the auroras. It ignored the passages between the 
light-curtains, which led eventually, slowly, to the only structure on the 
hills, the only thing on which they could focus. As the shape pushed through the 
membranes, they roiled darkly, discolored, touching and attaching again. The 
keeper of the temple could follow the angry violet path of their healing, and 
his own wounds ached in sympathy. He hugged his long arms closer around his bony 
knees, and watched the approaching shape with great, reflective eyes, slowly 
blinking. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The keeper had been alone for so long that 
his isolation had become a habit; for a moment, he hoped the shape might be a 
wanderer, lost but needing to continue, so he could point it a direction and 
send it on its way. He could see, by then, that it was a person. Its progress 
was direct, purposeful. The keeper wondered how it had found its way, without 
following the labyrinth. The sky was obscured among the curtains. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw that it was tired. It neither faltered nor 
staggered, but came quite slowly. As it approached, the auroras seemed to impede 
it. It broke through the final veil, stumbled, fell against the low wall, 
reached to cross it, failed. The keeper could only see its hand, two black 
fingers and thumb, tips of silver claws, against gray stone. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rose and limped across the courtyard, walking 
faster than when he wished to conceal the limp. A pulse beat in the wrist he 
touched, too slow, too weak. His hands lingered, touching delicate bones through 
thin bands of muscle and mole-smooth skin. He rediscovered the sensation of 
touch, the friction of fur as short as it can be against the same, the warmth of 
contact. It had been a long time since he had touched another person, even in 
greeting. His heartbeat quickened. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin shape 
breathed twice, shallowly, quickly, as he touched it. He saw the unnatural 
angles of its broken bones, and turned it over gently, caressing, so he could 
pick it up. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drew back, guiltily. This person was 
a youth, barely a youth, one who had not yet made a decision. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hands were more gentle as he picked the youth 
up<NOBR>--</NOBR> gentle, as one carries a child. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He 
placed the youth on his own hard bed outside the temple. The collapse must have 
been from pain. The long third finger of the left hand was broken, and the wing 
it supported lay crumpled like a smashed ion sail. The keeper opened the dark 
wing, pulling long frail fingers away from the back of the arm where they had 
tried to fold. No bone had pierced the skin, nor were the soft membranes torn 
away or even cut. The wing might heal. The keeper set himself to straightening 
the bones. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hoped that care would overcome lack of 
knowledge, and prevent the youth from being crippled. When he was almost 
finished, he realized he was being watched. He glanced up. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He managed not to look quickly away. The youth had 
pastel-green eyes that made his well-formed face ugly. The keeper looked back at 
the youth's broken wing, as if that were the natural thing to do. "I've done the 
best I could with thy hand," he said, speaking as one speaks to children and 
youths. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I tried to fly over the auroras." The tone 
was defiant, proud, expecting castigation. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is 
dangerous," the keeper said mildly. Above the temple, the atmosphere was as 
confused as the light-curtained passages. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hoped I 
would be killed." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deep despair for one so young." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's dying," the youth said. "Everything's dying." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The keeper saw that the youth was half-irrational 
from pain and exhaustion. "Sleep," he said. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't 
you believe me? Didn't you know? You're supposed to be a seer." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou art very cynical." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth did not answer, turned away, tried, 
clumsily, to flex the splinted wing. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is less 
solid than the earth," the keeper said. "Thou shouldst be gentle." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why did you help me? Why should you care?" the 
youth cried in confusion, hatred, grief. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to 
sleep," the keeper said. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved inside the temple 
to perform his duties. They were few, and empty tradition. The god had departed, 
long before its last, ridiculed worshippers, as gods always do. The keeper knew 
that, and allowed himself no illusions about his status. It was his by chance 
and luck and response to pain, not divine gift. He poured libations to a memory, 
to a real god, the soul of unconscious things, not outgrown but driven away. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he had finished his rituals, he returned to the 
youth, who slept the healing sleep. The keeper felt the throat-pulse and 
temperature and found neither sufficiently elevated. The precarious, rapid 
metabolism of their species had to accelerate when called on to heal. The keeper 
hunched down beside the bed, newly concerned. The youth's fine wide broken wing 
lay stretched open across the gray stone courtyard, useless as insulation, 
losing heat. The keeper did not stir for quite a long time. Finally he moved, 
painfully, and lay down on the narrow pallet. Quite chastely, and with some 
guilty reluctance, he enfolded the youth in his own one good wing. Then he, too, 
slept. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much time had passed since anyone had come to 
induce prophecies, to wait as he hunched before the altar, sleep-watching, 
tranced. Now, lying beside the youth, he could feel a vision at the edge of his 
mind, but it was too distant and too weak to grasp. All the youth's resources 
were focused within; none were left for resonances. After exhausting himself 
struggling toward the vision in sleep, the keeper only dreamed. He awoke with 
memories of close, beckoning stars and high thin air, and a twisting sense of 
loss. He had dreamed of flying with his mate, so high that below them the earth 
curved away, yellow and brown and white-wisped with clouds. The sky was purple 
and gold in the daytime, shading to pale blue on the horizons, black and silver 
at night. He had loved his mate, but she was dead, and he had loved the night, 
but it was beyond his reach. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The keeper lay still, 
unwilling to move and renew his pain. But he must; his own warmth had helped a 
little, but the youth's body needed food to maintain itself. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The keeper's supplies were not well suited to 
providing sufficient energy. No one brought meat anymore, and he could not hunt. 
He was crippled, fit only to serve an abandoned god. He lifted his wing, folded 
it silently, and rose, to prepare seed paste and broth. He moved slowly, masking 
pain with caution, and the appearance of grace. Before, when people had come, 
his manner toward them had been equally graceful, and the children had lost 
their reticence after only a little while. The adults preferred to pretend 
apprehension and fear, for they came to the temple to keep their excitement 
high, to combat impatience, as they would glide over a live volcano or chase a 
whirlwind. Sometimes the fear could be real. If they stayed long enough, he 
might tell them their deaths with enigmatic visions they would not recognize 
until they were imminent. That was the way of seers. But the people were gone; 
they did not need him anymore. They had not really needed him for a long time, 
and perhaps they had never needed him at all. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
keeper carried the broth outside and held the shallow bowl to the youth's lips. 
The youth, half-awake, eyes half-open, seemed not to notice the vegetable taste. 
The keeper felt the thin tight muscles and smooth skin against his supporting 
hand, but at the same time saw the ugly eyes again. They were like the soft 
jellied plants or creatures that grew in the dark, and died in the sunlight. He 
envied the youth's wings, but pitied the eyes. His patient could never fly much 
higher than the clouds without going blind. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
youth muttered incomprehensibly and flailed at the keeper's hand so the nearly 
empty bowl clattered across the Stone paving. The keeper sat back on his heels, 
but the youth was asleep again. After a little while, the keeper lay down on the 
pallet again and opened his good wing. He slid his hand across the youth's 
chest, slowly, gently, following sharp lines of ribs, soft skin. The youth 
shifted. Suddenly guilty, the keeper clenched his touching-fingers into a fist, 
and lay rigid. <BR>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 
<BR><BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the auroras, one day was 
indistinguishable from the next. The curtains of light screened out the sun and 
brightened the darkness. Without darkness or light as a rough guide, the keeper 
had no idea how long the youth slept. He only knew that his time became more 
difficult. He could not avoid touching the youth, who needed to be fed and kept 
warm and clean, and whose wing's tendons and muscles would contract without 
massage. He worked hard over the youth, trying to ignore his feelings, trying to 
control them. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, who would know if he drew his 
hands along the thin body, half-extended the short silver talons, drew narrow 
lines of love against the skin? He could embrace the sleeper, extending both his 
wings, and no one would pull away at the rough contact of tattered webbing. 
Children fondled and explored each other's androgynous genitals<NOBR>--</NOBR> 
why should he restrain himself? Whispered words might influence a decision yet 
to be made, words and the persuasion of experienced hands, even through sleep. 
And if the youth awakened, what right could anyone so ugly have to object? Who 
else but a cripple would take such a mate? Who was left to care? 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his eyes against his fantasies, and felt 
ashamed. The auroras<NOBR>--</NOBR> his pride, his prison<NOBR>--</NOBR> 
throbbed just beyond the low stone wall. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he 
felt most cynical and most alone, he sometimes calmed himself with assurances 
that he was the most worthy of his people, strong enough (for was he not alive?) 
to afford kindness and even mercy. Yet of the few crimes his people recognized, 
the action he contemplated now was the worst. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had 
been lonely for a long time. He had understood his solitude, but never accepted 
it. He was a proud thing, despite his wounds. He might have been bitter and 
cruel, or vain and futile, but he had even been too proud for that, too proud to 
allow despair to change him even when there was no one left to see. Now he began 
to fear that his strength and pride were near exhausted. Attracted, despite the 
ugliness of the pastel eyes, the keeper could feel himself falling in love. He 
forced himself to begin thinking of the youth in the masculine. When the 
youth... when <I>he</I> awoke, that could be even more influencing than treating 
him as sexed while he was asleep, but his awakening would force the keeper away 
from his fantasies. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And perhaps the youth would 
approach him, in the way that was right and proper, and then the fantasies would 
no longer be needed. <BR>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 
<BR><BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew the bones had knit, well or badly, 
when the youth's temperature sank toward normal even while he covered him. He 
folded his wing and rolled away, unwilling to be so near when the youth awoke. 
He got up, slowly, and limped into the temple. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, finishing his duties before the ancient 
altar, he heard a stirring outside. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth, 
awake, was pulling at the splint. The keeper squatted down beside him and pushed 
his hand away. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm healed, aren't I? Or I wouldn't 
have woken up." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The keeper, in his fantasies, had 
forgotten or discounted the youth's hostility; he was taken aback by it now. "I 
hope that thou art healed," he said evenly. He removed the splint and gently 
stretched the wing. The web was soft, and cool. It was almost as hard to take 
his hands away, even though the youth was awake. The line of the bone was clean, 
sharp under skin, light. The bone was unscarred, still hollow. "Thou must move 
it several days before requiring it to bear thy weight." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth touched the break with his other hand, 
stood, and opened his wings to their wide full span, reaching. He smiled, but 
the keeper could detect a slight sag in his wing, a weakening of unused muscles, 
a contraction of tendons. "I think thou wilt fly again," he said, and it was the 
truth. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth suddenly dropped his wings, 
staggering, smile gone, weakened by his mild exertion so soon after awakening. 
All his bones protruded; his body had half-starved itself, and would need time 
to recover. The keeper reached up, steadied him, but the youth winced when the 
flap of wing that did not fold brushed against him. The keeper glanced up; after 
meeting his gaze, the youth looked away. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We should, 
perhaps, be tolerant of each other's weaknesses," the keeper said, cruelly, 
hurt. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? Nothing forced you to help me. I don't 
owe you anything." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The keeper levered himself to his 
feet, walked a few steps, stopped. "No," he said. "I could have let thee heal 
with thy bones twisted." He heard the sweep of wings opening slowly, wing tips 
brushing the ground. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I would have died," the youth 
said, as if he had committed some crime by living. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So they thought of me," the keeper said, facing 
him, "when they left me on the hunting plain for the scavengers." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth said nothing for a time. The keeper 
wondered how he had survived infancy: someone must have cared a great deal, or 
no one had cared at all. He must have been fiercely protected or virtually 
ignored until his sentience awoke and he was too old to expose. Letting him die 
would have been kinder than leaving him to live as an outcast. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And they left you here. Why do you help, instead of 
hating?" <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Perhaps I'm weak, and cannot stand the 
sight of pain." The youth glanced up, purposely looking straight at the keeper's 
eyes, holding his own gaze steady. His expression was quizzical. They both knew 
the keeper would never have lived if he had been weak. It was the youth who 
looked away first, perhaps from a habit of hiding his eyes so people would 
tolerate him. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth opened his wing, one long 
finger at a time. The webbing was so smooth, so glossy, that the auroras 
reflected off it, scarlet and yellow, like flames. "It hurts," he said. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Still, thou must move it. It may help if I aid thee 
in stretching it." He opened his own broken wing a little, showing the bones 
pulled out of shape by shortened tendons. "I knew what should have been done 
while I slept." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth looked at the wing for a 
long moment, fascinated, horrified. "Please fold it." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The keeper pulled his fingers against the back of 
his arm, bending his elbow so they would fit. The torn flap hung loose. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm sorry." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Never 
mind." <BR>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 
<BR><BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their conversations were crystalline. The 
keeper would have preferred to cease touching the youth completely, but he 
needed to help with the wing, and he refused to allow himself to takeout his 
disappointment on a person. He had hoped his own deformities might cease to 
matter; that they did not was hardly the youth's fault. The revulsion in him was 
perhaps less than in others, and perhaps growing weaker, but still present, 
undeniable, unavoidable. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The keeper began to believe 
that he himself might as well have died. He had been strong enough to break his 
fall, strong enough to crawl under a thorn bush away from scavengers, strong 
enough to sleep eleven days and live. He remembered waking up, peering out 
through barbed twisting branches at the people hunched watching him and 
listening to his prophetic mutterings. One held laths and another funeral veils, 
waiting to brace his wings open and launch him if he died. Even then, with his 
skin stretched taut over his starved bones, he had been strong enough to crawl 
toward them, to make a purposeful move to tell them that he would live, that 
they could rightly help him and take him as their seer. But he was not strong 
enough for this loneliness and desertion. <BR>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * <BR><BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shrill squeal 
roused him from a doze, leaving him half-awake, confused, exhausted. He heard 
another sound, a cry abruptly cut off. He folded his wings and moved into the 
courtyard. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found the youth sitting against the 
wall of the temple, sucking the neck vein of a rabbit-deer so freshly dead that 
one hind foot still trembled in a muscle spasm. "Where didst thou get that? 
Animals never come past the auroras." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth 
began, delicately, to pull the small animal apart at the major joints. "Maybe it 
thought you'd tell it its future." He extended his silver claws and began to 
shred the meat from a narrow bone. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I do not mock 
thee." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth worried the carcass with his hands 
for a time. He looked up, and the auroras caught his eyes and brightened them 
horribly. "Didn't you hate them when you realized they were going to leave you 
behind? Didn't you want to slash them and tear them and demand what right they 
had to pretend you didn't matter?" <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, 
the keeper said, "I grieved." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had walked into the 
temple and stood near the back wall, before the stone figure that was crumbling 
with age and neglect. The keeper was the first in centuries to offer it anything 
even resembling belief. Slowly, painfully, he had relaxed his wing-fingers, 
until the scarred membranes lay half-folded around him. "Why did they help me?" 
he had cried. "If they did not need an oracle, why did they help me, and if they 
needed one, why did they leave me behind?" But the old god had made no answer, 
for if the keeper's belief were real, it had not been enough to call the god 
back. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I grieved," the keeper said again. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He expected disdain, but the youth looked down and 
stroked the stained pelt of the rabbit-deer. "Our world is grieving, too," he 
said softly. "They stole the spirit out of it, and sucked all the life away. All 
our people ever did was try to escape it, yet it mourns." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The keeper touched his shoulder, gently. "It must 
seem lonely to thee. But in time<NOBR>--</NOBR> " 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth made a sound of disgust. "There isn't any 
time. I hope... I hope they have to turn back. I hope they have to come running 
back to this world they loathed, because they'll find it dead and wasted and 
unfit to sustain them, and they'll die." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There will 
be no turning back in this generation. I dreamed the deaths of some of those who 
left, and there will be no disaster. The ships will continue, at least through 
our lifetimes." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth stood up, walked a few 
steps, taut-muscled, angry, spread his wings, allowed the tips to dust the 
stones. His claws were still bloody. "You'd have everyone substitute your 
fantasies for their own." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are all I have to 
offer, anymore." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But they weren't enough for our 
people, and all you do is grieve." The youth turned and folded his wings against 
his arms with that graceful smooth snap. "Something will happen, someday, and 
they'll have to return. They'll spread the sails and catch the rays of some 
distant sun, and they'll feel grateful that they have some place to come home 
to. But they never bothered to look at it, they only cared about ways to leave 
it. So now it's dying, and when they crawl back there won't be anything left." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The keeper realized what the youth was saying. "Thou 
must have had delusions in thy sorrow and pain," he said. "A world cannot die." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth glared at him, and his gaze did not shift, 
as if in anger he could forget his shame. "This world is dying. If you would 
sleep and attune yourself to it, the way you did for people, you'd see it. Or 
come outside your prison and look around." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I never 
leave the temple grounds." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth closed his 
eyes, resigned. "Then sit and wait, until the auroras die too." He left the 
keeper alone, and walked away with the tips of his beautiful wings trailing in 
the dust. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The keeper wanted to dismiss the youth as 
unbalanced, but nothing was that easy. It was true that their people had cared 
more for the sky and the nearby stars than for the world they rested on. It was 
only natural that this be so for a people who could soar so high that the ground 
curved away below them, admitting without defense its smallness and 
insignificance. Only natural for a people whose children make toy gliders with 
lifting wings by instinct. The stars were so close, they hung in the sky 
calling, hypnotic. The keeper and his mate, in their ion boat, sailing past the 
bay between the world and its moon, had navigated by sight and feel alone. And 
he had seen the ion ships, when the idea was still a fancy, in visions. Before 
the first was even finished, he had seen the thousand of them, carrying all the 
people, spread their huge sails and catch the sun's rays and begin to move, 
very, very slowly, toward a star the passengers already knew had planets they 
could touch their feet to and leave again. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His 
people had known much of stars. But he could not say that the world was not 
dying. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a little while, he stood up slowly and 
went to find the youth. "What dost thou mean to do?" 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached down and picked up a small stone. "What 
is there to do? I almost wish you had let me die." He hefted the pebble, as if 
he would throw it into the auroras. The keeper flinched, and saw him hesitate. 
He thought he would still throw it, but the youth lowered his hand and tossed 
the pebble back to the ground. "If I knew what to do, I'd do nothing." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are still people<NOBR>--</NOBR> " 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You and I may be the last, for all I know. Maybe 
all the others have killed themselves. I'd have it lonely to deny the rest a 
sanctuary." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must we both be lonely?" 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth turned his back, hunched his shoulders. 
The keeper thought he was offended by the implication. "I meant no 
impropriety<NOBR>--</NOBR> " <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Traditions are as dead 
as the god in your temple." He shrugged his wings. "You would have me stay." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I would ask nothing." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You'd hope." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One 
cannot control one's dreams." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'll stay for a 
while." <BR>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 
<BR><BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later the keeper slept, alone in the close 
and oppressive darkness of the temple. He expected a vision of the youth, alone 
in some future that did not include the keeper. He had never seen any part of 
his own destiny in his prophecies; that made him strangely afraid that no one 
could ever stay with him. He did not believe he could influence the future. 
Perhaps the future must influence him. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw his 
world, for the first time since he had come to the temple, and he saw that the 
youth had been right. Skeletons of rabbit-deer lay scattered on the hunting 
plain, and the vines that climbed the rock pinnacles of nests shriveled and 
died. Even the thorn bushes, which could grow where nothing else lived, dried, 
crumbled, burned. The death of their world would be slow, but the places he saw, 
deserted, were dying. He could not truly tell, but he thought he would die 
first. His visions had never frightened him before; now he came out of sleep 
screaming. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft wings rustled beside him. "Did you 
dream?" <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I did as thou asked," the keeper whispered, 
lying very still. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I was right." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is anyone else 
alive?" In the darkness, the young voice was fervent. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw no one," the keeper said. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah," the youth said, satisfied. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not omniscient." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You'd see what's important." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Other people were left." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They had nothing to keep them alive. Not your 
strength, nor my hate." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou hast made us too 
unique." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope not," the youth said. "I think your 
vision was right, and your hopes are wrong." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
keeper sat up, unwilling to sleep again. "I will never know." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It would hurt you to know that truth." The tone 
held compassion that sounded strange after the exultation in death, but the 
keeper was grateful for it. He watched the shadow of the youth move across the 
stone floor to the entrance and stand in the wavering light. He rose and 
followed him, stopping close behind him in his shadow. The youth began to talk, 
slowly, tentatively. "When the last of them left, I followed them as far as I 
could, until the sun was so bright I thought I'd go blind... I couldn't see 
them, but I don't think any of them looked back." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They did not," the keeper said, and the other did 
not question his knowledge. "It isn't the character of our people to look back. 
I think they'll never need to." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And if they 
don't<NOBR>--</NOBR> my determination is foolish?" 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The keeper spoke very cautiously, afraid to go too 
far. "Perhaps. Or futile. Thou wouldst deny thyself rather than them." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will... think about that." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind him, the keeper nodded to himself. "Wouldst 
thou eat?" <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All right." <BR>* 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 
<BR><BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth had not noticed the food while he 
was sleeping, but awake he had found it less than pleasing. "I'll go out and 
hunt as soon as I can fly again," he said. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm used 
to this. The auroras make a long path for thee to walk." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's better than staying here." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm used to that, too. But hunt, if that is thy 
wish." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soon?" <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. It 
is almost ready." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's still stiff." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou must stop favoring it." He sipped at his 
broth. "I will massage it again." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The touching was 
very much like the motions of love. The keeper could not remember touching any 
person before this youth since the night his mate had died. They had been 
flying. She was aged, but still beautiful, and she had decided to die. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the way of things. He had chosen her, and 
made his decision by his bond to her, when she was adult and he, not yet "he," 
was youth. Half a lifetime before, she, not yet "she," had courted and had 
bonded with another male, and in time he had aged and died. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, she did not wish to grow helpless. She would do 
what their people had always done, and forever would do, when it was time to 
die. And he would accept her decision, and carry her veils, as the mates of 
aging ones always had, and always would. Their children, one youth, one newly 
adult, bade her farewell. There would have been three, but their second was born 
with a twisted wing, so they had exposed it. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They 
flew together for a long time. No clouds obstructed their view of the hunting 
plain. Had they been hungry they could have feasted on warm meat and fresh 
blood, but this last night together they did not hunt. They drank thick salty 
wine and soared higher, giddy. She brushed her wingtip against his cheek, 
dropped back and down and caressed his chest and belly. She laughed, and made 
lewd and joyous remarks about whoever would become the next member of their long 
marriage line. She wished him happiness, and pulled a silver veil from his ankle 
band. He garlanded her with others. Defying her infirmities, she flew higher. He 
followed her, feeling the air grow thinner, dangerous, and suddenly cried out in 
ecstasy. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had never flown so high. He had heard 
about this from others, but no one could ever have seen, before, the colors 
behind his eyes. In reflex, his pupils contracted to pinpoints. He strained 
upward. His mate cried out to him, "Do you see?" and he called, "I see!" and she 
said, very softly, it seemed, "Be careful, my love, for I am blind." He looked 
toward her voice. Very dimly he could see her, tiny, higher than she had ever 
gone before, higher than he had ever seen anyone fly, wide-eyed against the 
radiation, the veils seeming only to drift beside her. He saw her wings begin to 
stiffen, and he knew that she was dead. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As another 
shower of subatomic particles exploded themselves in his eyes, brighter than any 
spark through the shielding of their ion boat, he realized he had flown past his 
wings' ability to carry him, and he felt himself begin to fall. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his struggle against the vertical wind ripped 
his wing, perhaps he should have allowed himself to die. Fighting, he slowed his 
fall, but in the end the earth had grasped and shattered him. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Keeper<NOBR>--</NOBR> " 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word, and a touch on his hand, brought him back. 
He glanced up, startled. The youth's face showed apprehension, irresolution. He 
drew in his wing-fingers, folding the smooth membrane. "It's not stiff anymore." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was remembering," the keeper said. "Thy words 
gave me hope, and I... I am sorry<NOBR>--</NOBR> " 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter." He let his touching fingers and 
half-exposed talons linger on the keeper's hand. "Nothing should be forced to 
die twice," he said. "If we continued our people, the world would kill our 
children, or the children would kill the world again." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou art not fair," the keeper said. "Some 
expression of my memory has frightened thee, but I asked for nothing." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's true that I'm frightened." He touched the 
keeper's throat, slid his hand to his shoulder, down his arm, back along the 
wing-fingers, and this time he didn't wince. "Of your kindness and your 
strength." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I do not understand thee." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'd change for you, I think." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The keeper sat back, reluctantly, away from the 
youth's hands. "Then thou wilt leave?" <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I must." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auroras led the 
youth on a long, twisting, directionless path to the hills. Outside, the thorn 
bushes should have been flowering. The youth stood at the edge of the temple's 
guardians and looked out over the land, at the brown and black thickets of 
twisted, dying branches. The wind blew hot against his body, and nothing moved 
as far as he could see. He felt death, and with it an ugly triumph that had 
ceased to give him pleasure. He glanced back, and almost turned, but reached 
high instead and snapped open his wings. The wind caught the webbing. He could 
feel the place where his bones had broken, and hesitated. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disgusted by his fear, he launched himself from the 
top of the hill, slipped sideways in a current, angled up, and flew. <BR>* 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 
<BR><BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the youth left, time passed strangely; 
it might have been a long or a short time later that the old breaks in the 
keeper's bones began to ache constantly. He had begun to age, and once aging 
started in his people, it progressed rapidly. His sharp sight began to dim. Only 
cowards and weaklings lived long enough to go blind naturally. He knew he should 
allow himself to live no longer, but still he did nothing. He did not wish to 
die on the earth, and he dreamed of dying properly, radiation-blind, flying. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt gentle hands that roused him from a doze, or 
perhaps it was all a dream. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Keeper, I am back." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his head and looked calmly into a face 
made ugly by its eyes. "It is thou." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No more," he 
said. "Not 'thou' for a long time." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The keeper 
seemed not to hear. "Hast thou seen everything die, then?" 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other supported him, and he smelled fresh blood. 
"No. You were right. There are others. Around them, the earth lives." He held 
the warm body of a small animal to the keeper's lips. "Drink it," he said. "Last 
time I was selfish." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood ran hot in the keeper's 
throat; he had almost forgotten the hunt. "Why art thou here?" 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the same reason I left." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long has it been?" 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A year." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah." Dark 
eyelids closed over darker eyes, tired. "It seemed longer." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seemed very short, to me." 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The keeper did not speak or move for a long time. "I 
am dying. Will you carry my veils?" <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw that the 
old one, half-dreaming, thought he could still fly. "I will. The stars will 
touch you." He gently lowered him. "I'll build you a glider, keeper," he 
whispered. He lay down beside him to wait, and opened his wing across him. He 
hoped the keeper could still feel it, and know the presence of one who loved 
him.
