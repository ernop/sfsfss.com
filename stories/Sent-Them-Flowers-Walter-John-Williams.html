<p>alter Jon Williams was born in Minnesota and now lives in
Albuquerque, New Mexico. His short fiction has appeared frequently in <em>Asimov&rsquo;s
Science Fiction,</em> as well as in <em>The Magazine of
Fantasy and Science Fiction, Wheel of Fortune, Global Dispatches,
Alternate Outlaws,</em> and in other markets, and has been
gathered in the collections <em>Facets</em> and <em>Frankensteins
and Other Foreign Devils.</em> His novels include <em>Ambassador
of Progress, Knight Moves, Hardwired, The Crown Jewels, Voice of the
Whirlwind, House of Shards, Days of Atonement, Aristoi, Metropolitan,
City on Fire,</em> a huge disaster thriller, <em>The Rift,</em>
and a <em>Star Trek</em> novel, <em>Destiny&rsquo;s
Way.</em> His most recent books are the first two novels in his
acclaimed Modern Space Opera epic, &ldquo;Dread Empire&rsquo;s
Fall,&rdquo; <em>Dread Empire&rsquo;s Fall: The Praxis</em>
and <em>Dread Empire&rsquo;s Fall: The Sundering.</em>
Coming up are two new novels, <em>Orthodox War</em> and <em>Conventions
of War.</em> He won a long-overdue Nebula Award in 2001 for his
story &ldquo;Daddy&rsquo;s World,&rdquo; and took another
Nebula in 2005 with his story &ldquo;The Green Leop&shy;ard
Plague.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Williams has made his name in New Space Opera circles with
novels such as <em>Aristoi</em> and the &ldquo;Dread
Empire&rsquo;s Fall&rdquo; books, but those are not the only
strings he has to his bow. In the droll and exciting adventure that
follows, he demonstrates that even if you have multiple universes to
flee through, the past has an uncomfortable way of <em>catching
up</em> with you&hellip;</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>We skipped through the borderlands of Probability, edging
farther and farther away from the safe universes that had become so
much less safe for us, and into the fringe areas where stars were
cloudy smears of phosphores&shy;cent gas and the Periodic Table
wasn&rsquo;t a guide, but a series of ever-more-hopeful suggestions.</p>

<p>Our ship was fueled for another seven years, but our flight
ended at Socorro for the most prosaic reason possible: we had run out
of food. Exchange rates and docking fees ate most of what little money
we had, and that left us on Socorro with enough cash for two
weeks&rsquo; food or one good party.</p>

<p>Guess which we chose?</p>

<p>For five months, we&rsquo;d been running from Shawn, or at
any rate the cloaked, dagger-bearing assassins we imagined him sending
after us. I&rsquo;d had nothing but Tonio&rsquo;s company and
freeze-dried food to eat, and the only wine we&rsquo;d drunk had
been stuff that Tonio brewed in plastic bags out of kitchen waste. We
hadn&rsquo;t realized how foul the air on the <em>Olympe</em>
had grown until we stepped out of the docking tube and smelled the pure
recycled air of Socorro Topside, the station floating in geosynchronous
orbit at the end of its tether.</p>

<p>The delights of Topside glittered ahead of us, all lights and
music, the sizzle of grilled meats and the clink of glasses. How could
we resist?</p>

<p>Besides, freaky Probability was fizzing in our veins. Our
metabolisms were pumped by a shift in the electromagnetic fine
structure constant. Oxygen was captured and transported and burned and
united with carbon and exhaled with greater efficiency. We
didn&rsquo;t have to breathe as often as in our home Probability,
and still our bodies ran a continuous fever from the boost in our
metabolic rate.</p>

<p>Another few more steps into Probability and the multiverse
would start fucking with the strong and weak nuclear forces, causing
our bodies to fly apart or the calcium in our bones to turn
radioactive. But here, we remained more or less ourselves even as
certain chemical reactions became much easier.</p>

<p>Which was why Socorro and its Topside had been built on this
strange outpost of the multiverse, to create alloys that
weren&rsquo;t possible in our home probabilities, and to refine
pure chemicals in industrial-sized quantities at a fraction of the
energy it would have taken elsewhere.</p>

<p>Probability specialists in the employ of the Pryor corporate
gene line had labored hard to locate this particular Probability, with
its unique physical properties&mdash;some theorists would argue, in
fact, that they&rsquo;d <em>created</em> it, like
magicians bringing an entire universe into being with their spell. Once
the Pryors had found the place, they&rsquo;d explored it for years
while putting together the right industrial base to properly exploit
it. When they finally came, they came in strength, a whole industrial
colony jigsawing itself into the Socorro system practically overnight.</p>

<p>Once they started shipping product out, they had to declare to
the au&shy;thorities where it came from, and this particular
Probability was no longer secret. Others could come and exploit it, but
the Pryors already had their facilities in place, and the profits
pouring out.</p>

<p>Nobody lived in Socorro permanently. There was something about
this reality that was conducive to forming tumors. You came in on a
three-year contract and then shipped out, with cancer-preventing
chemicals saturating your tissues.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yisss,&rdquo; Tonio said as we walked down
Topside&rsquo;s main avenue. &ldquo;Scru&shy;tinize the
fine ladies yonder, my compeer. I desire nothing so much as to bond
with them chemically, oh yisss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The local fashion for women was weirdly modest and demure,
cover&shy;ing the whole body and with a hood for the head, and the
outfit looked <em>inflated</em>&mdash;as if they were
wearing full-body life preservers, designed to keep them floating even
if Topside fell out of orbit and dropped into the ocean.</p>

<p>But even these outfits couldn&rsquo;t entirely disguise
the female form, or the female walk. My blood seemed to fizz at the
sight, and perhaps, in this quirky Probability, it did.</p>

<p>Music floated out of a place called the Flesh Pit, all
suggestive dark win&shy;dows and colorful electric ads for cheap
drinks. &ldquo;Let us sample the pleasures of this charming
bistro,&rdquo; Tonio suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about some food first?&rdquo; I said, but
Tonio was already halfway through the door.</p>

<p>The Flesh Pit had alcohol and other conventional stimulants,
and also others that were designed for our current reality, taking
advantage of the local biochemistry to deliver a packaged high aimed at
our pumped me&shy;tabolisms. The charge was delivered from a
pressure cylinder into a cheap plastic face mask. The masks
weren&rsquo;t hygienic, but after a few huffs, we didn&rsquo;t
much care.</p>

<p>While getting refills at the bar we met a short, brown-skinned
man named Frank. He was drinking alcohol, and joined us at our table.
After two drinks, he was groping my thigh, but he didn&rsquo;t take
it amiss when I moved his hand away.</p>

<p>The Flesh Pit was a disappointment. The music was bottom-grade
puti-puti and the women weren&rsquo;t very attractive even after
they took off their balloon-suits. After we bought Frank another drink,
he agreed to be our guide to Topside&rsquo;s delights, such as they
were.</p>

<p>He took us up a flight of stairs to a place that
didn&rsquo;t seem to actually have a name. The very second I
stepped into the front room, a woman attached herself to me, spreading
herself across my front like a cephalopod embracing its prey. My eyes
were still adjusting to the dim light and I hadn&rsquo;t seen her
until she&rsquo;d engulfed me.</p>

<p>My eyes adapted and I looked around. We were in what appeared
to be a small dance hall: there was a bar at one end and a live band at
the other, and benches along the sides where women smoked and waited
for partners. There were a few couples shuffling around on the dance
floor, each man in the octopus clutch of his consort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Buy me a drink, space man?&rdquo; my partner
said. Her name was &Eacute;toile and she wore a gardenia above one
ear. I looked longingly at the prettier girls sitting on the benches
and then sighed and headed for the bar. On my way, I noticed that Tonio
had snagged the most beautiful woman in the place, a tall, tawny-haired
lioness with a wicked smile.</p>

<p>I bought &Eacute;toile an overpriced cocktail and myself a
whiff of some exotic gas. We took a turn on the dance floor, then went
to the bedroom. Then back to the bar, then to the bedroom. Frank was
sent out for food and came back with items on skewers. Then the bar,
then the bedroom. I had to pay for clean sheets each time.
&Eacute;toile was very efficient about collecting.
Oc&shy;casionally I would run into Tonio and his girl in the
corridor.</p>

<p>By morning the bar was closed and locked, the dance floor was
empty, I was hungry and broke and melancholy, and Tonio&rsquo;s
girl had gone insane. She was crying and clutching Tonio&rsquo;s
leg and begging him to stay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you leave I&rsquo;ll never see you
again!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you leave I&rsquo;ll kill
myself!&rdquo; Then she took a bottle from the bar and smashed it
on a table and tried to cut her wrist with a piece of glass.</p>

<p>I grabbed her and knocked the broken glass out of her hand,
and then I pinned her against the wall while she screamed and sobbed,
with tears run&shy;ning down her beautiful face, and
&Eacute;toile tried to find the management or the bartender or
someone to get Tonio&rsquo;s girl a dose of something to calm her
down.</p>

<p>I gave Tonio an annoyed look.</p>

<p>He had driven his woman crazy in only one night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a new record,&rdquo; I told
him.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>&Eacute;toile returned with an irritated and sleepy-eyed
manager, who unlocked the bar and got an inhaler. He plastered the mask
over the weeping woman&rsquo;s face and cracked the valve and held
the mask over her mouth and nose till she relaxed and drifted off to
sleep. Then Tonio and I carried her to her room and draped her on the
bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She ever done this before?&rdquo; I asked the
manager.</p>

<p>He slapped at the wisp of hair atop his bald head as if it had
bitten him. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to watch her,&rdquo; I
said.</p>

<p>He shrugged his little mustache. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going back to bed,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>I looked at &Eacute;toile. &ldquo;Not me,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Unless you pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is necessary at this juncture,&rdquo; said
Tonio, &ldquo;for me to confess the infortunate condition of our
finances.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Infortunate.</em> Tonio was always making up
words that he thought were real.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then get your asses out of here,&rdquo; said
the manager. &Eacute;toile glared at me as if it weren&rsquo;t
her fault I had no money left.</p>

<p>We dragged ourselves back to the <em>Olympe.</em>
The ship smelled a lot better with air being cycled in from the
station. I wondered if I&rsquo;d ever be able to pay for the air I
was breathing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope Fanny will recover, yiss,&rdquo; Tonio
said as he headed for his rack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you <em>do</em> to
her?&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did things, yiss. It was Fanny did all the
talking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked again at Tonio and tried to figure out yet again why
so many women loved him. He wasn&rsquo;t any better-looking than I
was, and he was too skinny and he had dirt under his nails. His hands
were too big for the rest of him. He had blue eyes, which probably
didn&rsquo;t hurt.</p>

<p>Maybe the attraction was the broken nose, the big knot in the
center of his face that made it all a little off-center. Maybe
that&rsquo;s all it took.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, Gaucho,&rdquo; he said. He had his
sincere face on. &ldquo;I am aware that this contingency is
entirely my fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to worry about
that,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yiss, well.&rdquo; He reached down and took the
ring off his finger, the one with the big emerald that Adora had given
him, and he held it out to me. &ldquo;This is the only valuable
thing I own,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I desire that you take
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your ring,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>He took my hand and pressed the ring into it. &ldquo;If
necessity bides, you can sell it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t cognizate how much it&rsquo;s worth, but
it&rsquo;s a lot, yiss. It will pay for docking fees and enough
food to peregrinate to some other Probability where you might be able
to make a success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked at him. &ldquo;Are you saying goodbye,
Tonio?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shrugged. &ldquo;Compeer, I have no plans. But who
knows what the future may necessitate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ambled away to his rack. I looked at the ring on my
palm&mdash;all the intricate little designs on it, the dolphins of
the Feeneys and the storks of the Storch line all woven together in
little knots.</p>

<p>I went into my stateroom, where I closed the door. I put the
ring on my desk and looked at it for a while, and then I went to bed.</p>

<p>When I woke in the morning, the ring was still there, shining
like all the unpaid debts in all the multiverse.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>I met Tonio when I was working with my wife Karen on a mining
conces&shy;sion owned by her family, an asteroid known only by an
identification num&shy;ber. We were supervising the robots that did
the actual mining, following the vein of gold and sending it streaming
out into the void to be caught by the processor that hovered overhead.
Gold was a common metal and prices were low. The robots were old and
kept breaking down.</p>

<p>Tonio turned up in a draft of new workers, and we became
friends. He had his charm, and his strange Andevin accent, and the
vocabulary he&rsquo;d got in prison, where he had nothing to read
for months but a dictionary. He said the prison term was the result of
a misunderstanding about whether or not he could borrow someone
else&rsquo;s blazemobile.</p>

<p>Tonio and I became friends. After Karen and Tonio became
friends, I equipped myself with a heavy pry bar and went looking for
him. When he opened the door to his little room and saw me standing
there, he just looked at me and then shrugged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do whatsoever thou must, compeer,&rdquo; he
said, backing away from the door. &ldquo;For I deserve it in all
truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I stepped in and hefted the pry bar and realized that I
couldn&rsquo;t hit him. I lowered the bar and then Tonio and I
talked for about six hours, after which I realized that my marriage
hadn&rsquo;t been working in a long time, and that I wanted out and
that Tonio could have Karen for all I cared.</p>

<p>After the divorce, when everything had played itself out and
there was no point in staying on the claim of a family to which I was
no longer tied, I left the scene along with Tonio.</p>

<p>Of the various options, it was the course that promised the
most fun.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>The <em>Olympe</em> isn&rsquo;t a freighter,
it&rsquo;s a small private vessel&mdash;a yacht in fact, though
I&rsquo;m far from any kind of yachtsman. The boat can carry cargo,
but only a modest amount. In practice, if I wanted to carry cargo,
there were three alternatives. Passengers. Compact but valuable cargo,
which often means contraband. And information, dispatches so private
that the sender doesn&rsquo;t want to broadcast them even in
cipher. Usually the dispatches are carried by a courier.</p>

<p>Once we docked on Socorro, I advertised <em>Olympe</em>&mdash;I
even offered refer&shy;ences&mdash;but didn&rsquo;t get any
takers, not right away. Fortunately, docking on Socorro was
cheap&mdash;this wasn&rsquo;t a tourist spot, but an industrial
colony with too much docking capacity&mdash;and the air was nearly
free. So Tonio got a job Upside, selling roasted chestnuts from a
little wheeled grill&mdash;and with his blue eyes and broken nose
working for him, he soon sold more chestnuts than anyone in the history
of the whole pushcart business.</p>

<p>I took my aurora onto the station and went looking for work as
a musi&shy;cian. I did some busking till I got a job with a band
whose aurorista was on vacation in another Probability, and my little
salary and Tonio&rsquo;s got us through the first month even though
the puti-puti music bored me stiff. Then I auditioned for a band that
had a series of regular gigs in upscale bars, and they took me on. I
got a full split and a share of tips instead of a tiny salary, and
things eased a bit. Even the music was better. We played
popu&shy;lar songs while the tables were full of the dinner crowd,
but afterward we played what we liked, and when I got a good grind
going, I could make the room sizzle the way my blood sizzled in this
little corner of the multiverse.</p>

<p>During our flight, I&rsquo;d had nothing to do but
practice, and I&rsquo;d got pretty good.</p>

<p>A couple of months went by. I didn&rsquo;t see Tonio
much&mdash;he&rsquo;d got a girl&shy;friend named Mackey
and was spending his free time with her. But he sent a piece of his pay
into my account every month, to help pay for <em>Olympe.</em></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t have to sell the ring. I put it in the
captain&rsquo;s safe and tried not to think about it.</p>

<p>The docking fees got paid, and our air and water bill. I had <em>Olympe</em>
cleaned and the crudded-up old air filters replaced. I polished the
wood and the ornate metalwork in my stateroom till it glistened, and
put up some of Aram&rsquo;s old things, in case I wanted to impress
a potential passenger with the luxury we could offer. I started
stocking the larder against the day it was time to leave.</p>

<p>I began to relax. Perhaps Shawn&rsquo;s vengeance was not
quite so hot on our tail. I even spent some dinars on my own pleasures.</p>

<p>Not knowing whether or not it was a good idea, I went back to
the place where Frank had taken us that first night. I wanted to find
out if Tonio&rsquo;s tawny-haired woman was all right. But I
didn&rsquo;t see her, and I had barely started chatting with a
couple of the employees when the manager recog&shy;nized me and
threw me out.</p>

<p>Which was an answer, I guess.</p>

<p>There were other places to have fun, though, that
didn&rsquo;t come with bad memories. My band played in a lot of
them. I met any number of women in them, and we had a good time with
the sizzling in the blood and nobody went crazy.</p>

<p>So it went until a friend of Frank&rsquo;s made an offer
to hire <em>Olympe.</em> Eldridge was a short man with
fast, darting hands and genes left over from some long-ago fashion for
albinism. His pale hair was shaggy, and his eyes looked at you with
irises the color of blood.</p>

<p>Eldridge offered a very generous sum to ship a small cargo out
to one of the system&rsquo;s outer moons, a place called Vantage,
where a lot of mining and processing habitats were perched on vast
seams of ore. The trip would take five days out and five back, and I
was free to take any other cargo on the return trip. Half our fee would
be paid in advance, half on delivery. The one condition Eldridge made
was that the seals on the packages should not be broken.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d been scraping a living aboard <em>Olympe</em>
long enough to know what that stipulation meant, and I knew what I
meant to do about it too.</p>

<p>The band hired a temporary aurora player, and Tonio quit his
chestnut-selling job even though his boss offered him a bonus. We had
no sooner cleared Upside than the two of us went into the cargo space
and broke every seal on every container, digging like maniacs through
cushions of spray foam to find exactly what was supposed to be there,
bottles of rare brandy or expensive lubricating oil for robots or
canister filters for miners&rsquo; vac suits. We searched until the
air was filled with a blizzard of foam and I began to wonder if
we&rsquo;d misjudged Eldridge entirely.</p>

<p>But in what was literally the final container, we found what
we were looking for, about forty kilos of blue salt, exactly the
stimulant to keep miners working those extra hours to earn that
end-of-the-year bonus, to keep them all awake and alert and safe until
the salt turned them into sweating, shivering skeletons, every synapse
turned to pork cracklings while heavy metals collected in their livers
and their zombie bodies ran on chemi&shy;cal fumes.</p>

<p>Well, well, I thought. I looked at Tonio. He looked at me.</p>

<p>Vantage would have been a couple months away except that <em>Olympe</em>
could shift to a Probability where we could make better time, a place
where the stars hung in the sky like hard little pearls on a background
of green baize. We made a couple course changes outside our regular
flight plan, then docked at Vantage and waited for the police to come
and tear our ship apart.</p>

<p>Which they did. It was all part of Eldridge&rsquo;s plan.
The griffs would find the blue salt in our cargo hold, and
we&rsquo;d be arrested. The salt would find its way from police
lockers to Eldridge&rsquo;s dealers on Vantage, who would sell it
and give the griffs a piece. In the meantime, the griffs would collect
our fee from Eldridge in fines, and the money would be returned to
Eldridge. I&rsquo;d be coerced into signing over <em>Olympe</em>
in exchange for a reduced sentence, and <em>Olympe</em>
would be sold, with the profits split between Eldridge and the griffs.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the sort of trap that tourists in the
Probabilities walk into all the time. But Tonio and I aren&rsquo;t
tourists.</p>

<p>The griffs came in with chemical sniffers and found nothing,
which meant they had to break into the cargo containers, and of course
found that they&rsquo;d been broken into already. &ldquo;A
freelance captain&rsquo;s got to protect
him&shy;self,&rdquo; I told the griff lieutenant. &ldquo;If
I find contraband, it gets spaced.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t admit to actually having found the salt.
I didn&rsquo;t know the local laws well enough to know whether that
admission would implicate me or not, so I refused to admit anything.</p>

<p>The lieutenant in charge of the search just kept getting more
and more angry. I was worried that she or one of her cronies would
plant some con&shy;traband on the ship, so I made a point of
telling her that I&rsquo;d turned on all the ship&rsquo;s
cameras, one in every room and cargo space, and was livecasting the
whole search back to a lawyer&rsquo;s office on Upside. If she
tried to plant anything, it would be caught on camera.</p>

<p>That sent her into a towering rage, and she tossed all the
staterooms for spite, ripping the mattresses and blankets off the beds
and emptying the closets onto the deck, before she stomped off.</p>

<p>I planned to unload the cargo and leave the second we could
get clear&shy;ance, but thanks to the griff lieutenant&rsquo;s
temper tantrum, we had to do some cleanup first. That&rsquo;s why
we had time for a passenger to find us. That&rsquo;s how we met
Katarina.</p>

<p>Katarina was one of the Pryors, the incorporated gene line
that pretty much owned the system, all of Upside and most of Downside,
as well as every facility on Vantage. She&rsquo;d been on some kind
of inspection tour of the Pryor facilities on the various moons, but
she&rsquo;d been unexpectedly called back to Socorro and needed a
ride.</p>

<p>When the message first came that someone wanted passage to
Socorro, I&rsquo;d been worried that Katarina was a plant from the
police or from Eldridge, but as soon as I looked at her I knew that she
was going to be a lot more trouble than that.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the way the gene lines operate
internally, with all the cloning and use of cartridge memories and
marriages by cousins to keep all the money and power in the same
pedigree, but it was clear from the second she came aboard <em>Olympe</em>
that she ranked high in the structure. She had that eerie perfection
that came with her status. Geneticists had sweated over her body years
before she&rsquo;d ever been born. Flawless complexion, perfect
black hair, perfect white teeth, full expressive lips, black eyes that
looked at me for a full half-second before they had added up my entire
life and riches, found them unworthy of further consideration, and
looked away. She wore an outfit that was the opposite of the
balloon-suits women wore in Socorro, a dark fabric that outlined
perfectly every curve of that genetically ideal body. I got dizzy just
looking at her.</p>

<p>She looked at my stateroom&mdash;I&rsquo;d moved my
stuff out of it&mdash;and spared an extra glance for the painting
I&rsquo;d put over the cabinet door that had been ripped off its
hinges by the griffs. The painting was of a nude woman on a sofa, with
a black ribbon around her neck and a bangle on her wrist. She has a
cat, and a servant bringing her flowers from the admirer
that&rsquo;s obviously just walked into the room. She&rsquo;s
looking out of the painting at her visitor with eyes hard and objective
and cutting as obsidian.</p>

<p>Aram had that painting in the stateroom when he&rsquo;d
died. I&rsquo;d kept it for a while, but put it away later. It is
true that travelers, stuck in their ships for months at a time, like to
look at pictures of naked ladies, but not the same lady all the time,
and not one who looks back at you the way this one does.</p>

<p>I looked for a startled moment at Katarina and the woman in
the paint&shy;ing, and I realized that they had the same look in
their eyes, that same hard, indifferent calculation. She turned those
eyes to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a room for my secretary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; With a torn mattress and a
smashed chair, but I didn&rsquo;t men&shy;tion that.</p>

<p>She left the stateroom to call for her secretary and her
baggage. In the corridor, she encountered Tonio.</p>

<p>He grinned at her, blue eyes set on either side of that broken
nose. Those hard black eyes gazed back, then softened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is <em>this</em>?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p><em>Trouble</em>, I thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the cook,&rdquo; Tonio said.</p>

<p>Of course, she was married. They almost always are.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>Tonio and I had first come aboard <em>Olympe</em>
as crew. Aram was the owner and captain&mdash;he was a Maheu and
had inherited money and power and responsibility, but after eight
hundred years he&rsquo;d given up everything but the money, and
traveled aimlessly in <em>Olympe,</em> looking for
something that he hadn&rsquo;t seen somewhere before.</p>

<p>He also used massive amounts of drugs, which were sent to him
by Maheu&rsquo;s special courier service. To show that the drugs
were legitimate he had doctor&rsquo;s prescriptions for
everything&mdash;he collected them the way he had once collected
art.</p>

<p>Physically, he had the perfection of the high-bred gene lines,
with broad shoulders, mahogany skin, and an arched nose. It was only if
you looked closely that you saw that the eyes were pouchy and vague,
that his muscles were wasting away, and that his skin was as slack as
his first-rate genetics would permit. He was giving away his body the
same way he&rsquo;d given away his collection.</p>

<p>He was lonely too, because he would talk to Tonio and me,
about history, and art, and poetry. He could recite whole volumes of
poetry from memory, and it was beautiful even though most of it was in
old languages, like Per&shy;sian, that I&rsquo;d never heard
before and didn&rsquo;t understand.</p>

<p>I asked him about his gene line, his connections, what he did
before he&rsquo;d started his wandering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was prostitution,&rdquo; he said, with a
look at the painting on his stateroom wall. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to talk about it, now I&rsquo;m trying to
regain my virtue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These conversations took place in the morning, after
breakfast. Then he&rsquo;d put the first patch of the day on his
arm and nod off, his head in Maud&rsquo;s lap.</p>

<p>Maud Rain was his girlfriend. She looked about seventeen, and
maybe she was. She appeared as if her genetics had been intending to
create a lily, or cornflower, or some other fragile blossom, and then
been surprised to discover they&rsquo;d produced a human being. She
was blond and green-eyed and blushed easily, and she loved Aram
completely. I was a little in love with her, myself.</p>

<p>Life aboard the <em>Olympe</em> was pleasant, if
somewhat pointless. We wandered around the multiverse without a
schedule. We&rsquo;d stop for a while, and Aram would leave the
ship to visit old friends or see something new that he thought might
interest him, and we wouldn&rsquo;t hear from him for anywhere
between three days and three months, then abruptly we&rsquo;d be on
our way again. Aram paid us well and gave us a good deal of time off,
and once he bailed Tonio out of a scrape involving the wife of a Creel
station superin&shy;tendent.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t pretend to understand the chemistry between
users and their con&shy;sorts, and I don&rsquo;t know whether
Aram talked Maud into using, or whether it was her own idea. I do know
that, like all users, Aram wanted to make everyone around him use too.
He offered the stuff often enough to me and Tonio, though I never heard
him make the same offer to Maud.</p>

<p>Whoever made up Maud&rsquo;s mind for her, she then went
on to make a stupid, elementary mistake. She gave herself the same dose
that Aram took, without his magic genes and all the immunity
he&rsquo;d built up over the de&shy;cades, and she screamed and
thrashed and went into convulsions. Tonio got his fingers savagely
bitten trying to keep the vomit clear of her mouth while I madly
shifted the ship through about eight Probabilities to get her to a
hospital. By the time we got her there, she didn&rsquo;t have much
of a brain left. She still blushed easily, and looked at you with
dreamy green eyes. She had the sweet-natured smile, but there was
nothing behind it but a void.</p>

<p>We left her in a place where they&rsquo;d look after her,
a stately white building on a pleasant green lawn, and <em>Olympe</em>
resumed its wanderings. Aram dete&shy;riorated quickly. He no
longer talked in the mornings. We&rsquo;d find him alone and
crying, the tears pouring down his face in silence, and then
he&rsquo;d put a new patch on his arm and drift away. One
afternoon, we found him dead, with six patches on his arm.</p>

<p>In his will, he left all his money to a trust for Maud, and he
left <em>Olympe</em> and its contents to me. He left Tonio
some money. I gave Tonio everything in the pharmacy, and he sold it to
someone on Burnes Upside and we gave Aram a long, crazy wake with the
profits. The rest of Tonio&rsquo;s money went to lawyers to fix a
misunderstanding that occurred during the course of the wake.</p>

<p>When we sobered up, I realized that I had a yacht, but no
money to sup&shy;port it.</p>

<p>Tonio was the only crew I ever had, because he
didn&rsquo;t expect to be paid. He did the job of a crew, and when
he had money, he paid me, as if he were a passenger. When I had money,
I shared it with him.</p>

<p>We kept moving, the same kind of random shifts we&rsquo;d
made with Aram.</p>

<p>It was almost enough to keep us out of trouble.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>Tonio spent that first night in the stateroom with Katarina
Pryor. I tried to console myself with the fact that this was all
happening in a whole other Probability from the one Katarina normally
lived in. I also tried to concen&shy;trate on how I was going to
handle Eldridge when I saw him again.</p>

<p>I checked some data sources and inquired about Katarina Pryor.
She was about fifty years old, though she looked half that and would
for the next millennium, if she so desired. She was one of the Council
of Seven that ran Socorro on behalf of the Pryor gene line.</p>

<p>Her husband, Denys, was another one of the Seven.</p>

<p>I let that settle in my brain for a while. Then I sent a
message to Eldridge, telling him that I wanted to meet him as soon as <em>Olympe</em>
docked Topside. He replied that it would be his pleasure to do so.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d see how much fun he&rsquo;d have.</p>

<p>I told Tonio of this development as we were walking to the
lounge. As he stepped into the room, he gave me the news.
&ldquo;Katarina has invited me to accompany her to Downside on
completion of our returnment. I have accepted, yiss, pending of course
my captain&rsquo;s sanction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katarina&rsquo;s secretary, a young Pryor named Andrew,
happened to be sitting in the lounge as we entered, and he looked as if
someone had hit him in the head with a brick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not as if people are going out of
their way to hire us,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;so the ship can
spare you. But&hellip;&rdquo; I hesitated, aware of the
presence of Andrew. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t this <em>remind</em>
you of anything, Tonio?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave me a look of offended dignity. &ldquo;The
situation of which you speak was on an entirely different
plane,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This, on the contrary, is <em>real.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The conversation was taking place in a Probability where stars
looked like spinning billiard balls on a felt-green sky, and he and
Katarina were traveling to another place where oxygen burned in their
blood like naphtha. Who knew how real <em>anything</em>
could be under such circumstances?</p>

<p>I asked Tonio if he could delay his departure with Katarina
until Eldridge came aboard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yiss. Most assuredly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He seemed perfectly confident.</p>

<p>I wish I could have echoed his assurance.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>Eldridge was present when <em>Olympe</em> arrived
at Upside, and he had brought a couple of thick-necked thugs with him.
They were hanging back from the personnel lock because there were
plainclothes Pryor security present, wait&shy;ing to escort
Katarina and her new beau on the first stage of their planetary
honeymoon.</p>

<p>I called Eldridge from the control room. &ldquo;Come on
in,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Leave your friends behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he came on board, he looked as if he were fully capable
of dis&shy;membering me all by himself, his small size
notwithstanding. I escorted him through the lounge, where Katarina and
Andrew waited for Tonio to finish his packing job, a job that would not
be completed until I gave him the high sign.</p>

<p>Eldridge&rsquo;s eyes went wide as he saw Katarina. She
wore a compromise between the local balloon-suits and the form-fitting
outfit she&rsquo;d worn when she came aboard, which amounted to a
slinky suit with a puffy jacket on top. But I don&rsquo;t think it
was her looks that riveted his attention.</p>

<p>He recognized her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Miss Katarina Pryor,&rdquo; I told him,
redundantly I hoped, &ldquo;and Mr. Andrew Pryor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pryor,&rdquo; Eldridge repeated, as if he
wanted to confirm this striking fact for himself.</p>

<p>Andrew gave him a barely civil nod. Katarina just gave him her
stone-eyed stare, let him know he had been measured and found wanting.</p>

<p>I went to the bar and poured myself a cup of coffee. You had
to drink coffee quickly here, because in this Probability it cools very
fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eldridge,&rdquo; I remarked. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t received my on-delivery fee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave me a scarlet stare out of his white face.
&ldquo;The cargo did not arrive intact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One crate went missing,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;It was probably the fault of the load&shy;ers, but since
I signed for it, you should feel free to deduct its value from the
delivery fee.&rdquo; I made a show of looking at the manifest on my
pocket adjutant. &ldquo;What was in that crate&mdash;? Ah, jugs
of spray foam mix. Value three hundred&mdash;would you say
that&rsquo;s a correct value, Miss Pryor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katarina drummed her fingers on the arm of the sofa.
&ldquo;Sounds about right, Captain Crossbie,&rdquo; she said,
in a voice that said <em>Don&rsquo;t bother me with this
crap.</em></p>

<p>I called up my bank account. &ldquo;Might as well do the
transfer now,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>Eldridge&rsquo;s eyes cut to Katarina, then cut back. His
lips went even whiter than usual.</p>

<p>If the Pryors decided to step on him, he wouldn&rsquo;t
leave so much as a grease spot on their shoes. He knew that, as did I.</p>

<p>He got out his own adjutant and tapped in codes with his one
long thumbnail. I saw my bank account jump by the anticipated amount,
and I put away my adjutant and sipped my coffee. It was already
lukewarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Want some coffee, by the way?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>Eldridge gazed at me out of those flaming eyes.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have some other business, but there&rsquo;s
no reason to bother Miss Pryor with it,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>He followed me into the control room, where I closed the door
and gestured him toward a chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consider that a penalty,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;for thinking I was new to the multiverse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Pryors aren&rsquo;t really protecting
you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re old family friends,&rdquo; I
said. I sat in the padded captain&rsquo;s chair&mdash; genuine
Tibetan goat hide, Aram had told me&mdash;and swiveled it toward
him. He just stared at me, his busy fingers plucking at his knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to sell you
coordinates,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>He licked his lips, pink tongue on paper-white.
&ldquo;Coordinates to what?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t answer.</p>

<p>We had put the blue salt in orbit around an ice moon, one that
circled the same gas giant as Vantage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The coordinates go for the same price as the
cargo.&rdquo; I smiled. &ldquo;Plus three hundred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He just kept staring. Probably that agate gaze had frightened
a lot of people, but I wasn&rsquo;t scared at all.</p>

<p>Five days around Katarina Pryor had given me immunity to
lesser terrors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want the
coordinates,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;your competition
will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sneered. &ldquo;There is no competition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There will be if Katarina takes you and your tame
police out of the equation,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>So, in the end, he paid. Once the money was in the account, I
gave Eldridge the seven orbital elements that described the
salt&rsquo;s amble about its moon. Someone from Vantage could
easily hop over and pick up the salt for him, and the strung-out miners
would go on getting their daily nerve-searing dose of fate.</p>

<p>I showed Eldridge out, and as he bustled away, he cast a look
over his shoulder that promised payback.</p>

<p>I sent a message to Tonio, telling him to solve his packing
crisis, and as I returned to the lounge, he came loping out of his
quarters, his belongings carried in a rucksack on one shoulder. Andrew
raised an eyebrow at the tiny amount of baggage that had taken so long
to pack.</p>

<p>Katarina rose to embrace Tonio. I watched as she molded her
body to his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am primed, lover mine,&rdquo; Tonio said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I showed them to the door. &ldquo;Thank you,
Captain,&rdquo; Andrew said, and with an expression like someone
passing gas at a funeral, handed me a tip in an envelope.</p>

<p>I looked at the envelope. <em>This</em> had never
happened before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See you later, compeer.&rdquo; Tonio grinned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I watched them walk toward their waiting transport, arms
around each other&rsquo;s waists. People stared. Wary guards
circled them. Eldridge and his people were long gone.</p>

<p>I decided it was time to buy and stow a lot of rations. A
year&rsquo;s worth, at least.</p>

<p>For two fools, running.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>But first I wanted to celebrate the fact that I now possessed
more money than I&rsquo;d ever had in my life, even if you
didn&rsquo;t count my tip&mdash;which was two thousand, by the
way, an inept attempt to buy my silence. I couldn&rsquo;t make up
my mind whether Eldridge was going to be a problem or not&mdash;if
I were him, Katarina would have scared the spleen right out of me, but
I didn&rsquo;t know Eldridge well enough to know how stubborn or
stupid he was.</p>

<p>While I considered this, it occurred to me to wonder how many
years it had been since I&rsquo;d had a planet under my feet.</p>

<p>Too many, I thought.</p>

<p>I opened my safe and put Tonio&rsquo;s emerald ring in my
pocket&mdash;no sense in leaving it behind for people like Eldridge
to find&mdash;and then I followed in the footsteps of Tonio and
Katarina and took the next ride down the grapevine to Downside. I
looked for tourist resorts and exotic sights, and though I discovered
there were none of the former, there were plenty of the latter. There
were mountains, gorges, and colossal wildlife&mdash;the
chemi&shy;cal bonding of the local Probability led to plants, even
those with Earth genetics, running amok. I saw rose blossoms bigger
than my head, and with a smell like vinegar&mdash;chemistry not
quite right, you see. Little pine trees grew to the size of Douglas
firs. Socorro&rsquo;s internal workings had thrust huge reefs of
nearly pure minerals right out of the ground, many of which the miners
had not yet begun to disassemble and carry away. For a brief time,
wearing a protective raincoat, breathing apparatus, and crinkly plastic
overshoes, I walked on the Whitewashed Desert that surrounded Mount
Cyanide. I bathed in the Red Sea. Then the Green Sea, the Yellow Sea,
and the Winedark Sea. The Yellow Sea stained my skin for days. It
looked as if I were dying of cirrhosis.</p>

<p>I kept the ring in a special trouser pocket that would open
only to a code from my personal adjutant. After a while, I got used to
the feel of it, and days went by before I remembered it was there.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d brought my aurora. Along the way there was
music, bars, and happy moments. I met women named Meimei, Sally June,
and Soda. We had good times together. None of them died, went crazy, or
slit their wrists.</p>

<p>Carried away by the sheer carefree joy of it all, I began to
think of going back to the <em>Olympe</em> and sailing
away on the sea of Probability. Tonio was probably still happy with
Katarina, and I could leave with his blessing.</p>

<p>I would be safe. Shawn wasn&rsquo;t after me. And Tonio,
provided he stayed put, would be as safe as he ever was, probably safer.</p>

<p>I contemplated this possibility for a few too many days,
because one morning I woke from a dense, velvety dream to the birdlike
tones of my adjutant. I told it to answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Compeer,&rdquo; said Tonio.
&ldquo;Wherewhich art thou?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shadows and fog,&rdquo; I said, because the
voice seemed to be coming from my dream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a party on the morrow. Come and
share it with me. Katarina would be delighted to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>I&rsquo;ll bet</em>, I thought.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>The hotel looked like a hovership that had stranded itself on
land, a series of swoops and terraces, surrounded by cypress trees the
size of skyscrapers, with gardenias as long as my leg tumbling brightly
down from the balco&shy;nies. Katarina had installed Tonio and his
rucksack in a five-room suite and given him an expense account that, so
far, he&rsquo;d been unable to dent.</p>

<p>Tonio greeted me as I stepped into the suite. His blue eyes
sparkled with joy. He looked well scrubbed and well tended, and his
hair was sleek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you bring your aurora, Gaucho?&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Let us repair to a suitable location, with drinks and
the like, and partake of heavenly music.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought we were going to a party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is later. Right now we&rsquo;ve got to
have you measured for clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A tailor with a double chin and a ponytail stepped out of a
side room, had me take off my jacket, and got my measurements with a
laser scriber. He vanished. Tonio led me out of the apartment and down
a confusing series of stairs and lifts to a subbasement garage. Empty
space echoed around us, supported by fluted pillars with lotus-leaf
capitals. Tonio whispered a code into his adjutant and turbines began
their soft whine somewhere in the darkness. Spotlights flared. A
blazemobile came whispering toward us on its cushion of air. I felt its
breath on my face and hands. The colors were gray and silver, blending
into each other as if they were somehow forged together. The lines were
clean and sharp. It looked purposeful as a sword.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nice,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Is this
Katarina&rsquo;s?&rdquo; I had a hard time not calling her
&ldquo;Miss Pryor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine,&rdquo; Tonio said.
&ldquo;Katarina purchased it for me after, ah, the
inci&shy;dent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a misunderstanding about another
vehicle,&rdquo; Tonio said. &ldquo;I thought I had the
owner&rsquo;s permission to take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ah, I thought. One of <em>those</em>
misunderstandings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you driving?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you drive? You&rsquo;re
better than I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I settled into the machine gingerly. It folded around me like
a piece of origami. Tonio settled into the passenger seat. I drove the
car with care till I got out of town, then let the turbines off their
leash, and we were soon zooming down a highway under the
system&rsquo;s fluorescing, shivering smear of a sun, huge jungle
growth on either side of the road turning the highway into a tunnel
beneath vines and wild, drooping blossoms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another car behind us,&rdquo;
I said, looking at the displays. I was sur&shy;prised it could keep
up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be Katarina&rsquo;s
security,&rdquo; Tonio said. &ldquo;It is a mark of her love.
They follow me everywhere, to render me safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And to prevent, I thought, any of those misunderstandings
about who owns what.</p>

<p>A blissful smile crossed Tonio&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;Katarina and I are so in love,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I sing her to sleep every night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The thought of Tonio crooning made me smile. &ldquo;That
sounds great,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We wish to have many babies, but there are
complicatories.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like her husband?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is obstacular, yiss, but the principal problem
is legal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It turned out that Katarina did not legally own her own womb,
as well as other parts, which belonged to the Pryor family trust. She
could not become pregnant without the permission of certain
high-ranking members of her line, who alone knew the codes that would
unlock her fertility.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; not the usual
problem,&rdquo; I said, stunned. I don&rsquo;t know much about
how the big corporate gene lines work, but this seemed extreme even for
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you hire a surrogate?&rdquo; I asked.
&ldquo;Use an artificial womb?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the same.&rdquo; He cast a
glance over his shoulder. &ldquo;Those individuals behind
us&mdash;mayhap you can outspeed them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I set the jets alight. My vision narrowed with acceleration,
but oxygen still blazed in my blood. Alarms began to chirp. The vehicle
trailing us fell back, but before long we came to a town and had to
slow.</p>

<p>It was a sad little mining town, covered with the dust of the
huge magnesite reef that loomed over the town. Vast movers were in the
process of disassembling the entire formation, while being careful not
to ignite it and incinerate the entire county.</p>

<p>Tonio pointed to a bar called the Reefside. &ldquo;Pull in
here, compeer. Mayhap we may discover refreshment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bar sat on its tracks, ready to move to another location
when the last chunk of magnesite was finally carried away. I put the
blazemobile in a side street so as not to attract attention to
ourselves. We climbed up into the bar and blinked in its dark,
musty-scented interior. We had arrived during an off-peak period and
only a few faces stared back at us.</p>

<p>We huffed some gas and shared a bag of crisps. After ten
minutes, the security detail barged in, two broad-shouldered,
clean-cut, thick-necked young men in city suits. After they saw us, one
went back outside, and the other ordered fruit juice.</p>

<p>The regulars stared at him.</p>

<p>I asked the bartender if it was all right to play my aurora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can if you want,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but if the music&rsquo;s shit, I&rsquo;ll tell you
to stop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair,&rdquo; I said. I opened
the case and adjusted the sonics for the room and put the aurora
against my shoulder and touched the strings. A chord hung in the air,
with just a touch of sourness. The bartender frowned. I tuned and began
to play.</p>

<p>The bartender turned away with a grudging smile. I made the
aurora sound like chimes, like drums, like brass. Our fellow drinkers
began to bob their heads and call for the bartender to refill their
glasses. One gent bought us rounds of beer.</p>

<p>The shifts changed at the diggings and miners spilled in,
their clothes dusty, their respirators hanging loose around their
necks. Some were highly specialized gene types, with sleek skin and
implants for remote control of heavy equipment. Others were generalized
humans, like us. One woman had lost an arm in an accident, and they
were growing it back&mdash;it was a formless pink bud on the end of
her shoulder.</p>

<p>I played my aurora. I played fierce, then slow. The miners
nodded and grinned and tapped their booted feet on the grainy plastic
floor. The security man clung unhappily to his glass of fruit juice. I
played angry, I played tender, I played the sound of birds in the air
and bees in their hive. Tonio borrowed a cap from one of the diggers
and passed it around. It came back full of money, which he stuffed in
my pockets.</p>

<p>My fingers and mind were numb, and I paused for a moment.
There was a round of applause, and the diggers called for more
refreshment. A few others asked who we were, and I told them we were
off a ship and just traveling around the country.</p>

<p>Tonio had a blazing white grin on his face. &ldquo;It is <em>spectacular!&rdquo;</em>
he said. &ldquo;This is the true joy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than with Katarina?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shrugged. &ldquo;With Katarina it is sensational, but
she is terribly occu&shy;pied, and I don&rsquo;t know anyone
else in this coincidence of spacetime. People fear to be in my
vicinity, and when I corner one, they only speak to me because they are
afraid of Katarina. I have nothing in my day but to wait for Katarina
to come home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t she give you a job? Make you her
secretary, maybe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has Andrew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her social secretary, then.&rdquo; I
couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at the idea.</p>

<p>He gave a big grin. &ldquo;<em>She</em> knows
the social rules, yiss. I am signally lacking in that area of
expertise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could be a prospector. Travel around looking
for minerals or what&shy;ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For this task they have satellites and artificial
intelligences.&rdquo; He gazed for a long moment off into nowhere.
&ldquo;I am filled with gladness that you came to see me,
Gaucho.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I came.&rdquo; Though
I&rsquo;m not certain I was telling the truth.</p>

<p>Tonio was getting bored with his life with Katarina. A bored
Tonio was a dangerous Tonio.</p>

<p>We talked and drank with the miners till Tonio said it was
time to leave. Our guard was relieved to follow us out of the bar. His
partner had been guarding our blazemobile all this time.</p>

<p>We were both too drunk to drive, so we got in the car and told
the auto&shy;pilot to take us home. Once we arrived, I had a
fitting with the tailor, who had run up my suit while we were off
enjoying ourselves. I had this deep blue outfit, all spider silk, with
lots of gold braid on my cuffs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; I asked Tonio.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are my captain,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and now you are dressed like one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel ridiculous,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait till you see what <em>I</em> am
compelled to wear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tailor adjusted the suit, then gave me the codes so that I
could alter the suit&rsquo;s fit if I wanted to, or add a pocket
here or there. In the meantime, Tonio changed. His suit was the latest
mode, with ruffles and fringes that seemed to triple the volume of his
thin body. He looked unusual, but he carried himself with his usual
jaunty style, as if he wanted it made clear to everyone that he was
only <em>pretending</em> to be the person in the suit.</p>

<p>Katarina arrived and wrapped herself around Tonio without
caring if I was there or not. I was reminded of my little limpet-girl,
&Eacute;toile.</p>

<p>Katarina began tearing at Tonio&rsquo;s ruffles and
fringes. They went off to the bedroom for a lust break. I went out onto
the balcony and watched the sun set over the jade forest. The sweet
smell of flowers rose on the twilight air.</p>

<p>Tonio and Katarina returned. She wore a dark lacy sheath that
was as simple as Tonio&rsquo;s suit was elaborate. Gemstones
glittered sunset-red about her neck, and a languid postcoital glow
seemed to float around her like a halo. I could feel sweat prickling my
forehead at her very presence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking very well, Captain
Crossbie,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking well yourself,&rdquo;
I said. There was a bit more regard in her glance than I usually got. I
wondered if Tonio had been telling her stories that made me seem, well,
interesting.</p>

<p>We went to the party, which was in the same building. It
celebrated the fact that some production quota or other had been
exceeded, and the room was full of Pryors and their minions. Katarina
took Tonio&rsquo;s arm and pressed herself to him all night, making
it clear that they were a couple.</p>

<p>The place was filled with people who were perfectly perfect,
perfect ev&shy;erywhere from their dress to their genetics. All the
talk I heard was of busi&shy;ness, and complex business at that. If
I&rsquo;d been a spy sent by the competition, I would have heard a
lot, but it would have been opaque to me.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t let anyone tell you that people like the
Pryors don&rsquo;t work for their riches and power. They do nothing
else.</p>

<p>I was introduced as Captain Crossbie, and people took me for a
yachts&shy;man, which technically I suppose I was. People asked me
about regattas and famous captains, and I admitted that I only used my
yacht for travel. I was then asked where I&rsquo;d been, and I
managed to tell a few stories.</p>

<p>I was talking about yachts to an engineer named
Bond&mdash;his dream was to buy a ship when he retired, and
travel&mdash;when a blond man came up to talk to him. I thought the
newcomer looked familiar, but didn&rsquo;t place him right away.</p>

<p>He talked to Bond about some kind of bottleneck on the
Downside grapevine station that was threatening to interfere with
shipments to Upside, and Bond assured him that the problem would be
engineered out of existence in a couple weeks. He asked after
Bond&rsquo;s family. Bond told him that his son had won some kind
of prize from the Pryor School of Economics. It was then that the blond
man turned to me.</p>

<p>He had the chiseled perfection that came with his flawless
genes, and violet eyes, and around his mouth was a tight-lipped tension
that nature&mdash; or his designers&mdash;had not quite
intended for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Mister Denys Pryor,&rdquo; Bond said.
&ldquo;Denys, this is Captain Crossbie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He realized who I was about the same instant that I finally
recognized him as Katarina&rsquo;s husband. The violet eyes
narrowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
accomplice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any response to
that,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;d expect you to
be&shy;lieve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave me a contemptuous look and stalked away. Bond looked
after him in surprise, then looked at me. Then the light dawned. Panic
flashed across his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll excuse me,&rdquo; he said,
and was gone before I could even reply.</p>

<p>That was the last conversation I had at the party. Word about
my con&shy;nection to Tonio flashed through the room faster than
lightning, and soon I was alone. I got tired of standing around by
myself, so I went out onto the terrace, where a group of women in
immaculate white balloon-suits were grilling meats. I was considering
chatting up one of them when Tonio came up, carrying a pair of drinks.
He handed me one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My apologies, compeer,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;They are stuck-up here, yiss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been treated worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked up at the strangely infirm stars. &ldquo;I have
Katarina by way of compensation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
have nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have <em>Olympe,&rdquo;</em> I
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking maybe it&rsquo;s time
she and I flew away to the next Probability.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at me somberly. &ldquo;I will miss your
companionhood,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have Katarina.&rdquo; I looked
at the sky, where Upside glittered on its invisible tether.
&ldquo;I hope Eldridge isn&rsquo;t still looking for
me,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to worry about
Eldridge,&rdquo; Tonio said. &ldquo;I told Katarina all about
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hot terror flashed through my nerves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you tell her?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told her that Eldridge tried to use us to smuggle
his salt, and that we found the stuff and spaced it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I relaxed a little. The scene that Eldridge and I had played
in front of Ka&shy;tarina might not seem that suspicious, if, of
course, she believed her lover.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t hear the news?&rdquo;
Tonio said. &ldquo;About that police officer that was found in the
vacuum, over on Vantage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My mouth was dry. &ldquo;That griff lieutenant?&rdquo;
I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her captain. The lieutenant is learning a new job,
floating in zero gravity and sucking up industrial wastes with a big
vacuum cleaner.&rdquo; He rubbed his chin. &ldquo;The Pryors
don&rsquo;t like people fucking up their workers with
drugs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t seem to mind all those
enhanced production quotas, though,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Do
you think those come from workers who aren&rsquo;t spiked
up?&rdquo; There was a moment of silence. The scent of sizzling
meat gusted past. &ldquo;What happened to Eldridge?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. Didn&rsquo;t bother to
ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If anything was going to harden my determination to leave
Socorro as quickly as I could, it was this.</p>

<p>I turned to Tonio. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll miss
you,&rdquo; I said. I raised a glass. &ldquo;To happy
endings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before Tonio could respond, there was a sudden brilliant
radiance in the sky, and we looked up. An enormous structure had
appeared in the sky above Socorro, a vast black octahedron covered with
thousands of brilliant lights, windows enabling the 1.4 million people
aboard to gaze out at the passing Probabilities. To gaze down at <em>us.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Chrysalis,&rdquo; I said
aloud.</p>

<p>Surrounding the structure were half a dozen birds, each larger
than the habitat, long necks outstretched. The storks that were the
emblem of the Storch gene line, each with ghostly white wings flapping
in utter silence, holograms projected into space by enormous lasers.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I remembered Tonio&rsquo;s emerald ring, in its
special pocket on the old trousers I&rsquo;d left back at
Tonio&rsquo;s flat.</p>

<p><em>Too late</em>, I thought. Shawn had come for
us.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t keep them out,&rdquo;
Katarina said. &ldquo;This Probability isn&rsquo;t a secret any
longer, and anyone can exploit it now that it&rsquo;s
registered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I doubted the Pryors could keep the Chrysalis out even if they
wanted to. The Pryors maintained a police force here, not an army, and
I knew that the Chrysalis had weapons for self-defense. They had those
huge lasers they&rsquo;d used to project their flying stork
blazons, for one thing, and those could be turned to military use at
any time.</p>

<p>We sat on Tonio&rsquo;s terrace the morning following the
Storches&rsquo; arrival, soaking in the scent of blossoms. The
Chrysalis was still visible in daylight, its edges rimmed with silver.</p>

<p>Breakfast was curdling on our plates. Nobody was very hungry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Chrysalis is a state-of-the-art industrial
colony,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;They can park it here and start
exporting materials in just weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katarina gave me a tell-me-something-I-don&rsquo;t-know
look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have also made an official request,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;They want the two of you arrested on charges of
theft and turned over to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt myself turn pale, a chill touching my lips and cheeks.
&ldquo;What are we supposed to have stolen?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>Katarina permitted herself a thin smile. &ldquo;They
haven&rsquo;t said. We have re&shy;quested
clarification.&rdquo; She turned her black eyes to me.
&ldquo;They have also asked that your ship be impounded, until it
can be determined whether you obtained it by forging Aram
Maheu&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was all settled in the chancery court on
Burnes Upside,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Besides, if I was going to
forge a will to give myself a yacht, I&rsquo;d give myself the
money to keep it going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The request is a delaying tactic,&rdquo;
Katarina said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s to tie up your vessel for an
indeterminate period and prevent you from escaping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it going to work?&rdquo; I asked. Katarina
didn&rsquo;t bother to answer.</p>

<p>The previous night&rsquo;s party had ended with the
appearance of the Chrysa&shy;lis, as the Council of Seven went into
executive session and their employees scattered to duty stations to do
research on the Chrysalis and the implica&shy;tion of its arrival.</p>

<p>Apparently at some point in the night, Tonio had told Katarina
about Adora and Shawn, and Katarina must have believed him, because
neither of us was being tied to a chair and tortured by Pryor security
armed with shock wands.</p>

<p>Katarina rose and gave Tonio a kiss. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got a lot of meetings,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See you tonight, lover mine,&rdquo; Tonio said.</p>

<p>We sat in silence for a while as Socorro&rsquo;s strange
sun climbed above the horizon. I turned to Tonio.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you certain,&rdquo; I asked,
&ldquo;that Adora gave you that ring?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave me a wounded look. &ldquo;Surely I am not hearing
what I am hear&shy;ing, my compeer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t one of those
misunderstandings?&rdquo; I pressed. &ldquo;Where
you&rsquo;re certain she gave it to you, but she doesn&rsquo;t
remember doing it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am certain she told Shawn it was
stolen,&rdquo; Tonio said with dignity, &ldquo;but this is what
happened in sooth. He presented her with the ring at their
wed&shy;ding, a sentimental token, I imagine. But later she was
angry at Shawn for a scene he&rsquo;d made, where he was
complaining about how she had behaved with me at a certain social
function, and out of anger she bestowed the ring upon me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when you left and she went back to
Shawn,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;she couldn&rsquo;t admit it,
so she told him it was stolen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is my postulation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Or that was the postulation that Tonio wanted me to believe.</p>

<p>Tonio had been to prison, and in prison you learn to
manipulate people. You learn to tell them what they want to hear. Is it
lying if there is no harm intended? If it&rsquo;s just saying the
thing that&rsquo;s most convenient for everyone?</p>

<p><em>I didn&rsquo;t steal anything</em>. How
often in prison do you hear <em>that</em>?</p>

<p>I think Tonio was sincere in everything he said and did. But
what he was sincere <em>about</em> could change from one
minute to the next.</p>

<p>In any case, this had to be about more than just the ring. The
ring was valuable, but it didn&rsquo;t justify moving over a
million Storch employees to this Probability and opening mining
operations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did Shawn and Adora marry in the first
place?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their families told them to. They hadn&rsquo;t
met until a few days before the ceremony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But <em>why?</em> Usually line members
marry each other, like Katarina and Denys. It keeps the money in the
family. When they merge or take another outfit over, they do it by
adoption. But Shawn and Adora were different&mdash; each was
ordered to marry <em>out.</em> The Storches do heavy
industry. The Feeneys specialize in biotech and research. What did they
have in common?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tonio waved a hand in dismissal. &ldquo;There was a
special project. I did not ask for details, no. Why would I? It was
connected to Shawn, and when I was with Adora, I had no wish to talk
about Shawn. Why spoil a bliss that was so perfect with such a
subject?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it was so perfect, why did you leave
Adora?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;When I last saw you together, you
seemed so&hellip; connected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She grew too onerous,&rdquo; Tonio said.
&ldquo;Once we began to live together, she began giving orders. <em>Go
here. Do this. Put on these clothes. What do you want to name the
children?</em> Under the oppression my spirit began to chafe,
yiss. She loved me, but only as a pet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you had good
times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yiss.&rdquo; There was a soft light in his
eyes. &ldquo;They were magical, so many of our times. When we were
sneaking away together, to make love in an isolated corner of the
Chrysalis&hellip; that was bliss, my compeer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked up at the Chrysalis, hovering over our heads like the
Big Heavy Shiny Object of Damocles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think she&rsquo;s up there?&rdquo; I
asked. &ldquo;It was Adora who was the member of the Storch line.
Shawn was the Feeney half of the alliance. He could only command the
Chrysalis with the permission of his in-laws.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tonio looked at the sky in wonder. His face screwed up as he
tried to think.</p>

<p>I rose and left him to his thoughts. I needed to do a lot of
thinking myself.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>For the next several days we bounced around the apartment with
increasing energy and frustration. The news was grim. Shuttles from the
Chrysalis were exploring uninhabited parts of Socorro. There had been
one near-miss between a Storch shuttle and a Pryor transport.
Fail-safes normally kept ships from getting remotely close to one
another, so the miss had been a deliberate provocation.</p>

<p>Guards stood at our door and even on the next terrace, sensors
deployed, looking for any assassins lurking on the horizon.
Tonio&rsquo;s blazemobile privi&shy;leges had been revoked, and
he wasn&rsquo;t allowed out of the building.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love my little Katarina, yiss,&rdquo; he said
one day as he stalked about the main room. &ldquo;But this is
growing onerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A bored Tonio was a dangerous Tonio. If he walked out on
Katarina, we were both just so much dog food.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s just trying to protect
you,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll only last until the
business with the Storches is resolved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He flung out his arms. &ldquo;But how long will that
be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked at him. &ldquo;What if Adora&rsquo;s up
there, Tonio?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave me an exasperated look. &ldquo;What if she
is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think you can talk to her? Find out what she
wants?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tonio stopped his pacing. His startled face began to look
thoughtful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I can?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you try it from here, Katarina will be listening
in before you can spit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she won&rsquo;t let me <em>leave</em>
here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me work on that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His adjutant bleeped, and he answered. His face broke into a
look of pure joy as he said, &ldquo;Hello, lover.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Go on pleasing them, Tonio</em>, I thought.</p>

<p>I went to one of the security guards at our door and told him
that I needed to speak to Denys Pryor.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m even
talking to you,&rdquo; said Denys. I had been called into his
office, the design of which told me that he liked clean sight lines, no
clutter, curved geometries, and a terrace with a water view. He
remained at his desk as I entered, and was turned slightly away, so
that I saw his perfect chiseled features in three-quarter profile. He
wore fewer ruffles in his office than at the party.</p>

<p>There was no chair for me to sit in. Not anywhere in the room.
I had a choice of responses&mdash;Denys would probably have
preferred an awkward shuffle&mdash;so instead I leaned on his
immaculate white wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to solve your
problems,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>He raised an eyebrow.</p>

<p>No wonder Katarina was dissatisfied with him, I thought. She
could have conveyed the same suspicion and contempt without twitching a
single hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Chrysalis problem,&rdquo; I clarified,
&ldquo;and your Tonio problem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tonio Hope,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is
welcome to my wife. They deserve each other, and I hope
you&rsquo;ll tell them that. But the problem represented by the
Chrys&shy;alis is rather more urgent.&rdquo; He turned in his
chair to face me. &ldquo;Tell me your scheme, please. Then I can
have a good hearty laugh and have you thrown out of here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cuckolded husbands, I have observed, are rarely models of
courtesy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me one thing first,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;Is Adora Storch on the Chrysalis?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your friend&rsquo;s former lover?
Yes.&rdquo; His tone was bored. &ldquo;Apparently, he stole
something from her, but she&rsquo;s too embarrassed to admit what
it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her heart,&rdquo; I said. He looked away
suddenly, toward the distant lake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I would like,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is
a secure means of communication be&shy;tween Tonio and
Adora.&rdquo; And then, at the sudden, sharp violet-eyed look, I
added, &ldquo;Secure, I mean, from Katarina.&rdquo;</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>&ldquo;Start with flowers,&rdquo; I suggested. Tonio
contacted a florist on the Chrysalis and sent an extravagant bouquet,
with a humble little message. There was no reply. &ldquo;Just call
her,&rdquo; I said finally.</p>

<p>Her secretary kept him waiting for half an hour, while he
paced about gripping the adjutant I&rsquo;d got from Denys. I
played quiet, tinkly music on the aurora to keep him calmed down, while
I watched the muscles leaping on his face. Finally, I heard
Adora&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tonio! You have the nerve to call me after the way
you walked out on me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adora had taken half an hour to work up sufficient anger to
decide to confront Tonio instead of just leaving him hanging. Things
had worked out more or less as I&rsquo;d hoped.</p>

<p>Tonio looked at the adjutant&rsquo;s screen. Over his
shoulder I saw Adora&rsquo;s brilliant red hair, her flashing green
eyes, her pale rose complexion. He didn&rsquo;t reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;
she demanded. &ldquo;Have the lies stuck in your throat for the
first time in your life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I am but stunned, seeing you
again,&rdquo; Tonio said. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re angry
and suchlike, but&mdash;at least the anger shows you still
care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adora began screaming at that point, and I left the room. <em>Just
do what you do best,</em> I told Tonio silently.</p>

<p>I heard Tonio murmur, and more fury from Adora, and then a lot
of si&shy;lence, which meant Adora was doing the talking and Tonio
was listening. It went on for nearly two hours.</p>

<p>While it went on, I strummed the aurora, volume at a low
setting. I really didn&rsquo;t want to know how Tonio did these
things: I didn&rsquo;t think I could be trusted with the knowledge.</p>

<p>After the murmuring stopped, I walked back out into the main
room. Tonio sat on the sofa, his hands dangling over his knees. He
shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten what Adora was
like,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How beautiful she is. How
passionate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to tell Katarina,&rdquo; I
said. He looked up in shock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell her that I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell her that you&rsquo;re in touch with Adora.
Tell her it was my idea, and I made you do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because if you don&rsquo;t, Denys will.
He&rsquo;ll use it to turn Katarina against you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rubbed his face with one of his big hands. &ldquo;This
is complicated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell Katarina the next time you see her,&rdquo;
I said.</p>

<p>Which he did, that night. By morning, he had Katarina thinking
this was a good idea, and the three of us plotted strategy over
breakfast.</p>

<p>When, later that day, Denys told her of Tonio&rsquo;s
supposed treachery, she laughed in his face.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>While Denys was fuming, and Tonio and Adora were cooing at
each other with Katarina&rsquo;s approval, I decided that it was
time to find out as much as I could about the ring. I got free of
security by telling them I was going to report to Denys, and took the
ring to a jeweler. If I got no answer there, I&rsquo;d take it to a
laboratory.</p>

<p>I could feel my blood sizzle as I walked into the shop. There
was a little extra oxygen in the air here, I thought, to make the
customers happy and more willing to buy.</p>

<p>The jeweler was a dark-haired woman with a low, scratchy voice
and long, elegant hands. She stood amid cases of brilliant splendor,
but refused to be distracted by them. Her attention was devoted
entirely to the customer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Splendid work,&rdquo; she said, gazing at a
hologram of the ring as big as her head. &ldquo;The emerald is a
natural emerald, which makes it slightly more valu&shy;able than an
artificial one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; I asked.
She&rsquo;d made the judgment a split second after she&rsquo;d
put the ring into the laser scanner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Natural gems have flaws,&rdquo; the jeweler
said. &ldquo;Artificial gems are perfect.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Imperfection is worth more.</em> Perhaps that
says something about our world. Perhaps that says something about how
women relate to Tonio.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The setting is common gold and platinum,&rdquo;
the jeweler continued, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s more valuable than
the gem, because it&rsquo;s clearly handmade, and by a master. Let
me see if it&rsquo;s signed anywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She called up a program that would scan the ring thoroughly
for num&shy;bers or letters. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said,
and then cocked her head. She rotated the image, then magnified it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is curious. There are letters laser-inscribed
in the gem, and that&rsquo;s not unusual&mdash;most gems are
coded that way. But <em>this</em> is a type of code
I&rsquo;ve never seen.&rdquo; She frowned, and her long fingers
reached for her keyboard. &ldquo;Let me check&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said quickly.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I only recognized the number sequence because I was a pilot.
The num&shy;bers had nothing to do with the gem. They
weren&rsquo;t a code, they were a set of <em>coordinates.</em></p>

<p>For a Probability. And given how badly Shawn wanted it back,
it was almost certainly a <em>brand-new</em> Probability.</p>

<p>Feeney researchers must have developed it, very possibly a
Probability with one of the Holy Grails of Probability research, like a
Probability where electromagnetism never broke into a separate force
from gravity, or where atoms heavier than uranium have a greater
stability than in the Home Uni&shy;verse, thus allowing atomic
power with reduced radioactivity. The Feeneys had discovered this new
universe, but they needed an industrial combine with the power of the
Storches to exploit it properly. Hence a marriage to seal the bargain.
Hence a gem given by one line to the other with the
co&shy;ordinates secretly graven onto it.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t foolish enough to think the ring held the
only copy of the coordinates&mdash;the Feeneys wouldn&rsquo;t
have been that stupid. But it was the <em>only copy outside the
gene lines&rsquo; control.</em> If we gave the coordinates to
the Pryors, the Storches would have competition in their new realm
before they ever made their investment back.</p>

<p>No wonder something as huge and powerful as the Chrysalis had
been sent after us.</p>

<p>I asked the jeweler for an estimate of the ring&rsquo;s
worth&mdash;&ldquo;so I know how much insurance to
buy&rdquo;&mdash;and then I took the ring and walked out of the
shop with billions on my finger. The store&rsquo;s oxygenated
atmosphere boiled in my blood.</p>

<p>The ring was the best insurance in the world, I thought. Shawn
didn&rsquo;t dare kill us until he got his wedding present back.</p>

<p>That night, Tonio and Katarina had their first fight. She
complained about the time he was spending talking to Adora. He pointed
out that he was stuck here in the apartment and had nothing else to do.
It degenerated from there.</p>

<p>I went to my room and played the aurora, loudly this time, and
tried to decide what needed to happen next. It might be a good idea to
get Tonio closer to Adora, just in case he needed a fast transfer from
one girlfriend to another.</p>

<p>I went to Denys and suggested that we all go up the grapevine
to Upside, in case any face-to-face meetings became necessary. He
understood my point at once.</p>

<p>And so we all moved off the planet, spending a day and a half
in the first-class compartment of a car roaring up the grapevine.
Katarina spent the time adhered to Tonio, who looked uncomfortable.
Denys kept to a cubicle where he worked, except for his occasional
parades through the lounge, where he was all ostentatious about paying
no attention to his wife.</p>

<p>The atmosphere on the car was sullen and ominous and filled
with elec&shy;tricity, like the air before a thunderstorm. Even the
other passengers felt it.</p>

<p>To dispel the lowering atmosphere, I played my aurora, until
some pomp&shy;ous rich bastard told me to stop that damned noise or
he&rsquo;d call an attendant. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with Miss
Katarina Pryor,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;Take it up with
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned pale. I played on for a while, but the mood, such as
it was, had been completely spoiled. I went to my cabin and lay on my
bed and tried to sleep.</p>

<p>I needed to get away from Tonio and Katarina and Denys. I
needed to get away from this freakish Probability where my blood
sizzled all the time and my skin burned with fever. I needed to get <em>away.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to move onto <em>Olympe,&rdquo;</em>
I told Katarina. She was curled around the spot on a lounge sofa where
Tonio had just been sitting. He had gone to the bar for a cup of
coffee, but you could still see his impression on the cushions.</p>

<p>Her cold eyes drifted over me. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be out of your way. And
it&rsquo;s where I live.&rdquo; When she didn&rsquo;t
answer, I added, &ldquo;Look, I can&rsquo;t leave the dock
without your permission. I&rsquo;m not <em>going</em>
anywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned away, dismissing me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell
the guards to let you pass,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are <em>guards</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The only answer was an exasperated set to her lips, as if she
didn&rsquo;t con&shy;sider the question worthy of answer.</p>

<p>So it was that I showed the guards my ID and moved back onto <em>Olympe.</em>
The air was stale, the corridors silent. I stepped into the stateroom
and told the lights to go on and the first thing I saw was the painting
of the naked woman, staring at me. She reminded me too much of some
people I&rsquo;d grown to know, so I put the painting in storage.</p>

<p>I went to the pilot&rsquo;s station, where I&rsquo;d
talked to Eldridge, and checked the ship&rsquo;s systems, which
were normal. I wondered what would happen if I powered up the engines,
and decided not to find out.</p>

<p>For a few days, I indulged myself in the fantasy that I was
going to escape. I filled the larder with food and drink, enough for
eight months of flight to whatever Probability struck my fancy. I tuned
every system on the ship except the drive. I made plans about where
I&rsquo;d like to travel next.</p>

<p>I thought about putting the ring back in the safe, but 1
figured that the safe was no real obstacle to people like Denys or
Shawn, so I kept the ring in the special pocket in my trousers. Maybe
Denys or Shawn was less likely to rip off my pants than rip off the
door to the safe.</p>

<p>I went to some of the places I&rsquo;d enjoyed when I was
living Topside the first time. All the bars and restaurants that had
seemed so bright and inviting when I was just off a five-month voyage
now seemed garish and third-rate. Guards followed me and tried to be
inconspicuous. Without a friend, I didn&rsquo;t seem to be having
any fun.</p>

<p>It really was time to leave.</p>

<p>I brought a bottle home to the <em>Olympe</em>
and drank while I worked out a plan. I&rsquo;d sell the
ring&rsquo;s coordinates to Denys in exchange for our safety and a
lot of money. Then I&rsquo;d sell the ring itself back to Shawn for
the same thing. I&rsquo;d split the money with Tonio, and then
I&rsquo;d run for it while the running was good.</p>

<p>I looked at the plan again the next morning, when I was sober,
and it still seemed good. I was trying to work out my best approach to
Denys when Tonio came aboard. He was a reminder of everything I was
trying to escape and his presence annoyed me, but he was exasperated
and didn&rsquo;t notice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Katarina is more onerous than ever
before,&rdquo; he said. He flapped his big hands. &ldquo;I am
watched every moment, yiss. She says she is protecting me but I know
it&rsquo;s all because she doesn&rsquo;t want me to speak to
Adora. Yet out of every port I see the Chrysalis floating in the sky,
with Adora so near.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to keep Katarina&rsquo;s
trust,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Olympe</em> is the only place where
I&rsquo;m free,&rdquo; Tonio said. &ldquo;Katarina
doesn&rsquo;t mind if I come here. And that&rsquo;s why
you&rsquo;ve got to help me get Adora on board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adora?&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;Here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no place else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the ship&rsquo;s being watched. So is the
Chrysalis. If Adora comes here, they&rsquo;ll see her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tonio smiled. &ldquo;The Pryors and the Storches do not
confront each other all the time. Even if they&rsquo;re playing
chicken with each other&rsquo;s cargo ships, both the Chrysalis and
Socorro possess resources the other finds useful. There are ships
coming from the Chrysalis, to purchase certain commodi&shy;ties and
sell others and perform transactions of that nature. Adora will come in
one of these ships, and when the business is being transacted by her
min&shy;ions she will fly here to me in a vacuum suit, and enter
through our very airlock, bypassing those inconvenient guards upon the
door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was appalled. Tonio smiled. &ldquo;Adora assures me that
it will be perfectly safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>For whom</em>? I wondered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be on board when this
happens,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>When Tonio entertained Adora on my ship, I spent the time
shopping for stuff I never bought, and when I got bored with that, I
found a bar and huffed some gas. I didn&rsquo;t return to <em>Olympe</em>
until Tonio sent me a prearranged little beep on my adjutant.</p>

<p><em>Olympe&rsquo;s</em> lounge still smelled
faintly of Adora&rsquo;s flowery perfume. Tonio was splayed on the
couch. Energy filled his skinny body. His blue eyes were aglow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such a passion it was!&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Such zealocity! Such a twining of bodies and
souls!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad to know she doesn&rsquo;t want to kill you
anymore,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>He waved a hand. &ldquo;All in the past.&rdquo; He
heaved a sigh, and looked around the lounge, the old furniture,
Aram&rsquo;s brass-and-mahogany trim. &ldquo;I am glad to bring
happiness here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to counter those
memories of sorrow and tragedy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked at him. &ldquo;What memories are those?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The afternoon I spent here with beautiful little
Maud. The day before she gave herself that overdose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I stared at Tonio. Drugs whirled in my head as insects crawled
along my nerves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling me
that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked away and brushed a cushion with the back of his
knuckles. &ldquo;She was so sweet, yiss. So giving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had been off the ship that day, I remembered, making final
preparations for departure. Aram was saying goodbye to some of his
friends and picking up a new shipment of drugs from the Maheu office.
That must have been the time when Maud Rain had finally succumbed to
the magic that was Tonio.</p>

<p>And then, in remorse, she&rsquo;d decided to grow closer
to Aram. By becom&shy;ing a user, like him.</p>

<p>And now she lived in a little white room in the country, her
mind as white and blank as the walls that surrounded her.</p>

<p>I stood over Tonio. I felt sick. &ldquo;Remember
you&rsquo;re spending tonight with Katarina,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>The glow in his eyes faded. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;It is not that I am not fond of her, but the
circumstances&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear about the
circumstances,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Right now I need to be
alone so I can think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tonio was on his feet at once. &ldquo;I know I have made
an imposition upon you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I hope you
understand my gratitude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But I
need to be by myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatsoever thou desirest, my captain.&rdquo;
Tonio rose and loped away.</p>

<p>I went to the captain&rsquo;s station and sat on the
goatskin chair and decided that I had better get my escape plan under
way. I called Denys&rsquo;s office and asked for an appointment.
His secretary told me to come early the next day.</p>

<p>Tonio had been in prison, I thought. In prison, you learn how
to handle people. You learn how to tell them what they want and how to
please them.</p>

<p>I wondered if Tonio had been playing me all along. Telling me
what I wanted in exchange for a place to stay and a tour of the
multiverse and its attractions.</p>

<p>I had many hours before my appointment, but alcohol helped.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>This reality&rsquo;s blazing oxygen had burned the
hangover out of my blood by the time I stepped into Denys&rsquo;s
office. The geometries of the room were even more curved than his place
Downside, and there were even more windows. Outside the office, the
structures of Upside glittered, and beyond them was the ominous
octahedron of the Chrysalis, glowing on the horizon of Socorro.</p>

<p>There were two chairs in the room this time, but neither of
them were for me. Both were on the far side of Denys&rsquo;s desk.
One held Denys, and the other the black-skinned, broad-shouldered form
of Shawn Feeney.</p>

<p>Denys raised his brows. &ldquo;Surprised, Captain
Crossbie? Surely you don&rsquo;t imagine that you and Tonio are the
only people who employ back-channel communications?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was enjoying himself far too much. Cuckolds, as
I&rsquo;ve stated elsewhere, are rarely models of deportment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d asked for a private
meeting,&rdquo; I said, without hope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shawn and I have decided,&rdquo; Denys said,
&ldquo;that it&rsquo;s time for you and your friend to leave
this reality. We know that your ship is provisioned for a long journey,
and we intend that you take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do I know,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that
there isn&rsquo;t a bomb hidden somewhere in my ship&rsquo;s
pantry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two looked at each other and smirked. Denys answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because if you and Tonio disappear, or die
mysteriously, that makes <em>us</em> the
villains,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Whereas if you simply abandon
this Probability, leav&shy;ing the two ladies
behind&hellip;&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t resist a grin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then <em>you</em> are the bad
guys,&rdquo; Shawn finished in his deep voice.</p>

<p>I considered this. &ldquo;I suppose that makes
sense,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And in exchange for the free passage,&rdquo;
Denys said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the ring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>You</em>?&rdquo; I said, and
then looked at Shawn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll get it back
eventually,&rdquo; Shawn said. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll get
the credit for it, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Storch line,&rdquo; Denys said,
&ldquo;will have at least a couple years to exploit the new
Probability before we Pryors arrive in force. But even so,
we&rsquo;ll get there years ahead of the rest of the
competition&hellip; and <em>I&rsquo;ll</em> get
the credit for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shawn smiled at me. &ldquo;And <em>you&rsquo;ll</em>
get the blame for selling our secret to our rivals. But by then
I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll have lots of practice at
running.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could tell the truth,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you can,&rdquo; Shawn said.
He leaned closer to me. &ldquo;And the very best of luck with that
plan, by the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ring?&rdquo; Denys reminded.</p>

<p>I thought about it for a moment, and could see no alternative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To get the ring,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I
have to take my pants off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shawn&rsquo;s smile broadened. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
watch,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and enjoy your
embar&shy;rassment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tonio was in <em>Olympe</em> by the time I
returned. Delight danced in his blue eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have received a missive from Adora!&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;We are to flee together, she and I&mdash;and you,
of course, my compeer. She has bribed someone in Socorro Traffic
Control, yiss, to let us leave the station without alerting the Pryors.
We then fly to the coordinates she has provided, where she will join
us. From this point on we exist in our own Probability of bliss and
complete happiness!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I let Tonio dance around the ship while I went to the
captain&rsquo;s station and began the start-up sequence. Socorro
Traffic Control let us go without a murmur. I maneuvered clear of the
station and engaged the drive.</p>

<p>As we raced to the coordinates the message had provided, there
was no pursuit. No ships came out of some alternate Probability to
collide with us. No lasers lanced out of the Chrysalis to incinerate
the ship. No bomb blew us to fragments.</p>

<p>As we neared the rendezvous point, Tonio grew anxious.
&ldquo;Where is my darling?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;Where is Adora?&rdquo; His hands turned to fists.
&ldquo;I hope that something has not gone amiss with the
plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The plan is working fine,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;and Adora isn&rsquo;t coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told him about my meeting with Denys and Shawn, and what I
had been ordered to do. Tonio raged and shouted. He demanded I turn <em>Olympe</em>
around and take him back to his beloved Adora at once.</p>

<p>I refused. I fed coordinates into the Probability drive, and,
an instant later, the stars turned to hard little pebbles and we were
racing away from Socorro, leaving its quirky electromagnetic structure
in our wake.</p>

<p>Tonio and I were on the run. Again. Trapped with one another
in Reality, whether we liked it or not.</p>

<p>I had let Tonio play me, just as he had played Adora and
Katarina and Maud and the others. Now we were in a place where we had
no choice but to play each other.</p>

<p>Tonio was in despair. &ldquo;Adora and Katarina will think
I deserted them!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Their rage will know no
bounds! They may send assassins&mdash;fleets&mdash; armies!
What can I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Start,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;by sending
them flowers.&rdquo;</p>
