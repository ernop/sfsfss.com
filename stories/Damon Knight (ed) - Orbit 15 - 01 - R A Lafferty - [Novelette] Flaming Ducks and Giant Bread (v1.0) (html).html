discovered one day that it<i> does</i> have a thirteenth story after all, one
not built by the builders, one that is only entered by accident, one that is a
crazy jumble of insane things and happenings, one that isnÅft measurable in

is occupied by odd tenants who pay rent irregularly and in most odd specie. It
is used. And finally this story is restored to the numbering by the building
owners, even though it cannot always be found. Such is the year which we will

all conventional evil impossible to him when he was dressed in that thing. He
did, however, effect one year full of the most outrageous pseudo-evil ever.

sulfurous fury of the Tom Fool in the year of his shame. He was a card almost
too hot to handle. Yes, he was the Devil in bonds worse than chains, and he
would force the incongruity of his position onto the world and rub the worldÅfs
face in it. Aloysius had never noticed the intensity of the Tom Fool card

layer that is unaccountable; it is a sort of reverse burlesque of the painting
itself. But the fundamental layer of the painting and the surface layer are
valid and rational, and they are identical. This tricky intermediate layer can
only be picked up by middle infrared light of about one hundred and thirty
thousand angstroms, the so-called foolsÅf frequency. It really seems as if the
old paint of the picture had been split and another picture accomplished
between. These ghost or joker pictures are very salty burlesques, but they can
be seen but once. After being brought out by the foolsÅf-frequency light, they
fade away forever, and the painting becomes a single-layer thing. Fortunately I
have been able to get good photographs of a number of these out-of-place

of love, though, and with a Babylonian sort of fishiness. The falsified view of
the city was true for that one year, and it was the Whore of Babylon who sat on
the seven hills. This was the mystery woman whose roots go down to Hell, and
part of the mystery about her was that she was not really a woman. But she did
rule in Roma; she did set up a court of love, of false love, in that city that
was the city of the world. Epikt, I wonder if you could bring your great

sleepy poppy was partly responsible for their showing of solidity), and their

nothing artificial about the strangely mutated ears. They were well rooted, and
they were robust, the only robust things about those folk. And they had to be.
The noise there was loud. Even the great mutated ears often bled bright red
blood from the overpowering sound. And the sense of balance which lives in the
inner ear was often destroyed. This accounts for much of the eccentricity of
the chorea or St. Vitus dancers. They were the wobblies. The shattered and
shattering noises also deformed other wavicles: those of light (for they made
all colors into a crooked dazzle, and they manufactured colors where there
could not be colors); the olfactory wavicles, so that the cloying bloodiness of
giant bread, the sky-scorching feather smell of flaming ducks or quail, the
burning pine knots of the steamboats, the rotten-roses floweriness of the court

technology of Amor Town in the disputed year was anachronistic and atrocious.
There were the steamboats which could not have been if that were a proper
sequence year. But the steamboats were there and, especially in the mornings,
were always blocking dry and rubbled streets. It is believed that they steamed
out on the morning dew and were stranded when the dew dispersed. The
steamboats, old sternwheelers or sidewheelers, had names like HierophantÅfs Show
Boat, April Queen, JoanieÅfs Show Boat (the show girls on that one were named
Joanie, Janie, Jeanie, Junie, Johnny, and Ginny), The Big Casino, Fruity-TootieÅfs
Show Boat, and Five Card CharleyÅfs River Rag-Tag. It seemed that these
steamboats properly belonged to some other place and time (improperly, all
places and times belonged to Amor Town in the disputed year).</span></p>

circles and in loops. They exploded so as to shake the whole town. They buckled
in the middle and left droppings, sometimes a pile of clowns who untangled
themselves and ran in pursuit of their vehicles, sometimes a pile of camel
