RAPHAEL ALOYSIUS LAFFERTY was born in Iowa, moved to Oklahoma when four years old, and has been there ever since except for travel and four and one-half years in the army. Now in his fifties, Lafferty describes himself as "a correspondence school electric
a
l engineer" who has worked for electrical jobbers most of his life. He says, "I was a heavy drinker till about eight years ago at which time I cut down on it, beginning my writing attempts about the same time to fill up a certain void." Since then he has 
published scores of stories both in the science fiction magazines and such journals as New Mexico Quarterly, Literary Review, etc., and has been reprinted with increasing frequency in best-of- the-year anthologies.

But the only one who was doing any good was Deep John the Vagabond, called by Captain Roadstrum their native light-horse auxiliary. The old hobo had a very
 thin, very small stone slab, with a sharp cutting edge which he made to be the forward edge. He was able to attain very rapid flight on this and come in behind the flying giants. At first he used his handy rock in its swinging sling, crashing it into wha
t
 should have been the brain-base of the giants, but he could attain nothing against their bull-humps. Then he used his slab itself for a weapon, swooping in beyond them at a very high speed and calculated height, and just plain slicing their heads off wit
h the forward cutting edge of his slab. Their heads hit -the ground with thunderous thumps, and the crewmen could keep track of the kills of their ally.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid1991072\charrsid12139068

ped in on the men on their flying stones, fluttering and banking and using their slabs like shields, and then suddenly struck with their long spears and spitted the men. There was laughter that made the low skies ring like bells whenever they did this. Th

 went into the big houses and watched the big gamblers; and they listened to the tall stories about them. There was Johnny Greeneyes, who could see every invisible marking on cards with his odd optics. There was Pyotr Igrokovitch with the hole in his head

 Pyotr was the most persistent suicide of them all. Following heavy losses in his youth he had shot himself through the head. It had not killed him, but the shot had carried away great portions of the caution and discretion lobes of his brain. The passage
 through his head had remained open, with pinkish flaps of flesh covering the holes fore and aft.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af39 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid1991072\charrsid12139068

Now, whenever Pyotr suffered heavy losses, he jerked out his pistol and shot himself through the head. It was all for a joke; he always shot himself through the same passage; and the \'93brains\'94
 which he appeared to spew out the back opening with the shot were in reality only phlegm that had gathered in his head. But it was rather a weird thing when seen by one for the first time, and Pyotr very often killed spectators standing behind him.}{

 carefully, and in a way that I could not understand. They said that, things being the way they were, Miseremos and myself must marry. I was not adverse to this, loving the girl mightily, though I resented somewhat the manner and compulsion of it.}{
