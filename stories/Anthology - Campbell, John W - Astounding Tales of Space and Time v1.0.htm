<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>by Eric Frank
Russell</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>THE SHIP ARCED OUT OF A GOLDEN SKY AND LANDED WITH
A WHOOP AND a wallop that cut down a mile of lush vegetation. Another half mile
of growths turned black and drooped to ashes under the final flicker of the
tail rocket blasts. That arrival was spectacular, full of verve, and worthy of
four columns in any man's paper. But the nearest sheet was distant by a goodly
slice of a lifetime, and there was none to record what this far corner of the
cosmos regarded as the pettiest of events. So the ship squatted tired and still
at the foremost end of the ashy blast&#8209;track and the sky glowed down and
the green world brooded solemnly all around.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Within the transpex control dome, Steve Ander
sat and thought things over. It was his habit to think things over carefully.
Astronauts were not the impulsive daredevils so dear to the stereopticon&#8209;loving
public. They couldn't afford to be. The hazards of the profession required an
infinite capacity for cautious, contemplative thought. Five minutes'
consideration had prevented many a collapsed lung, many a leaky heart, many a fractured
frame. Steve valued his skeleton. He wasn't conceited about it and he'd no
reason to believe it in any way superior to anyone else's skeleton. But he'd
had it a long time, found it quite satisfactory, and had an intense desire to
keep it&#8209;&#8209;intact.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Therefore, while the tail tubes cooled off
with their usual creaking contractions, he sat in the control seat, stared
through the dome with eyes made unseeing by deep preoccupation, and performed a
few thinks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Firstly, he'd made a rough estimate of this
world during his hectic approach. As nearly as he could judge, it was ten times
the size of Terra. But his weight didn't seem abnormal. Of course, one's
notions of weight tended to be somewhat wild when for some weeks one's own
weight has shot far up or far down in between periods of weightlessness. The
most reasonable estimate had to be based on muscular reaction. If you felt as
sluggish as a Saturnian sloth, your weight was way up. If you felt as powerful
as Angus McKittrick's bull, your weight was down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Normal weight meant Terrestrial mass despite
this planet's tenfold volume. That meant light plasma. And that meant lack of
heavy elements. No thorium. No nickel. No nickel&#8209;thorium alloy. Ergo, no
getting back. The Kingston&#8209;Kane atomic motors demanded fuel in the form
of ten gauge nickel&#8209;thorium alloy wire fed directly into the vaporizers.
Denatured plutonium would do, but it didn't occur in natural form, and it had
to be made. He had three yards nine and a quarter inches of nickel&#8209;thorium
left on the feed&#8209;spool. Not enough. He was here for kees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>A wonderful thing, logic. You could start from
the simple premise that when you were seated your behind was no flatter than
usual, and work your way to the inevitable conclusion that you were a wanderer
no more. You'd become a native. Destiny had you tagged as suitable for the
status of oldest inhabitant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Steve pulled an ugly face and said,
&quot;Darn!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The face didn't have to be pulled far. Nature
had given said pan a good start. That is to say, it wasn't handsome. It was a
long, lean, nut-brown face with pronounced jaw muscles, prominent cheekbones,
and a thin, hooked nose. This, with his dark eyes and black hair, gave him a
hawklike appearance. Friends talked to him about tepees and tomahawks whenever
they wanted him to feel at home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Well, he wasn't going to feel at home any
more; not unless this brooding jungle held intelligent life dopey enough to
swap ten gauge nickel-thorium wire for a pair of old boots. Or unless some
dopey search party was intelligent enough to pick this cosmic dust mote out of
a cloud of motes, and took him back. He estimated this as no less than a
million&#8209;to-one chance. Like spitting at the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Empire</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
hoping to hit a cent&#8209;sized mark on one of its walls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Reaching for his everflo stylus and the ship's
log, he opened the log, looked absently at some of the entries.</p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Eighteenth day: The spatial convulsion

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He scowled, his jaw muscles lumped, and he
wrote slowly and legibly, &quot;Thirty&#8209;ninth day: Landed on planet
unknown primary unknown, galactic area standard reference and sector numbers
unknown. No cosmic formations were recognizable when observed shortly before
landing. Angles of offshoot and speed of transit not recorded, and impossible

yards.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Closing the log, he scowled again, rammed the
stylus into its desk&#8209;grip, and muttered, &quot;Now to check on the
outside air and then see how the best girl's doing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The Radson register had three simple dials.
The first recorded outside pressure at thirteen point seven pounds, a reading
he observed with much satisfaction. The second said that oxygen content was
high. The third had a bi&#8209;colored dial, half white, half red, and its
needle stood in the middle of the white.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Breathable,&quot; he grunted, clipping
down the register's lid. Crossing the tiny control room, he slid aside a metal
panel, looked into the padded compartment behind. &quot;Coming out,
Beauteous?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Steve loves Laura?&quot; inquired a
plaintive voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;You bet he does!&quot; he responded with
becoming passion. He shoved an arm into the compartment, brought out a large,
gaudily colored macaw. &quot;Does Laura love Steve?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Hey&#8209;hey!&quot; cackled Laura
harshly. Climbing up his arm, the bird perched on his shoulder. He could feel
the grip of its powerful claws. It regarded him with a beady and brilliant eye,
then rubbed its crimson head against his left ear. &quot;Hey&#8209;hey! Time
flies!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Don't mention it,&quot; he reproved.
&quot;There's plenty to remind me of the fact without you chipping in.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Reaching up, he scratched her poll while she
stretched and bowed with absurd delight. He was fond of Laura. She was more
than a pet. She was a bona fide member of the crew, issued with her own rations
and drawing her own pay. Every probe ship had a crew of two: one man, one
macaw. When he'd first heard of it, the practice had seemed crazy&#8209;&#8209;but
when he got the reasons, it made sense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Lonely men, probing beyond the edge of
the charts, get queer psychological troubles. They need an anchor to Earth. A
macaw provides the necessary companionship&#8209;&#8209;and more! It's the
space&#8209;hardiest bird we've got, its weight is negligible, it can talk and
amuse, it can fend for itself when necessary. On land, it will often sense
dangers before you do. Any strange fruit or food it may eat is safe for you to
eat. Many a man's life has been saved by his macaw. Look after yours, my boy,
and it'll look after you!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Yes, they looked after each other,
Terrestrials both. It was almost a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>symbiosis of
the spaceways. Before the era of astronavigation nobody had</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>thought of such
an arrangement, though it had been done before. Miners</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>and their
canaries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Moving over to the miniature air lock, he
didn't bother to operate the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>pump. It wasn't
necessary with so small a difference between internal</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>and external
pressures. Opening both doors, he let a little of his higher&#8209;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>pressured air
sigh out, stood on the rim of the lock, jumped down. Laura</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>fluttered from
his shoulder as he leaped, followed him with a flurry of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>wings, got her
talons into his jacket as he staggered upright.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The pair went around the ship, silently
surveying its condition. Front</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>braking nozzles
O.K., rear steering flares O.K., tail propulsion tubes O.K.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>All were badly scored but still usable. The
skin of the vessel likewise was scored but intact. Three months supply of food
and maybe a thousand</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>yards of wire
could get her home, theoretically. But only theoretically,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Steve had no
delusions about the matter. The odds were still against him even if given the
means to move. How do you navigate from you&#8209;don't&#8209;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>know&#8209;where
to you&#8209;don't&#8209;know&#8209;where? Answer: you stroke a rabbit's foot</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>and probably
arrive you&#8209;don't&#8209;know&#8209;where&#8209;else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, rounding the tail,
&quot;it's something in which to live.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>It'll save us
building a shanty. Way back on Terra they want fifty thousand smackers for an
all&#8209;metal, streamlined bungalow, so I guess we're mighty lucky. I'll make
a garden here, and a rockery there, and build a swimming pool out back. You can
wear a pretty frock and do all the cooking.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Yawk!&quot; said Laura derisively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Turning, he had a look at the nearest
vegetation. It was of all heights,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>shapes and
sizes, of all shades of green with a few tending toward blueness. There was
something peculiar about the stuff but he was unable to decide where the strangeness
lay. It wasn't that the growths were alien</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>and unfamiliar&#8209;&#8209;one
expected that on every new world&#8209;&#8209;but an underlying something which
they shared in common. They had a vague, shadowy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>air of being
not quite right in some basic respect impossible to define.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>A plant grew
right at his feet. It was green in color, a foot high, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>monocotyledonous.
Looked at as a thing in itself, there was nothing</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>wrong with it.
Near to it flourished a bush of darker hue, a yard high,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>with green, firlike
needles in lieu of leaves, and pale, waxy berries scattered over it. That, too,
was innocent enough when studied apart from its neighbors. Beside it grew a
similar plant, differing only in that its needles were longer and its berries a
bright pink. Beyond these towered a cactuslike object dragged out of somebody's
drunken dreams, and beside it stood an umbrella&#8209;frame which had taken
root and produced little purple pods. Individually, they were acceptable.
Collectively, they made the discerning mind search anxiously for it knew not
what.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>That eerie feature had Steve stumped. Whatever
it was, he couldn't nail it down. There was something stranger than the mere
strangeness of new forms of plant life, and that was all. He dismissed the
problem with a shrug. Time enough to trouble about such matters after he'd
dealt with others more urgent such as, for example, the location and purity of
the nearest water supply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>A mile away lay a lake of some liquid that
might be water. He'd seen it glittering in the sunlight as he'd made his
descent, and he'd tried to land fairly near to it. If it wasn't water, well,
it'd be just his tough luck and he'd have to look someplace else. At worst, the
tiny fuel reserve would be enough to permit one circumnavigation of the planet
before the ship became pinned down forever. Water he must have if he wasn't
going to end up imitating the mummy of Rameses the Second. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Reaching high, he grasped the rim of the port,
dexterously muscled himself upward and through it. For a minute he moved around
inside the ship, then reappeared with a four&#8209;gallon freezocan which he
tossed to the ground. Then he dug out his popgun, a belt of explosive shells,
and let down the folding ladder from lock to surface. He'd need that ladder He
could muscle himself up through a hole seven feet high, but not with fifty
pounds of can and water.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Finally, he locked both the inner and outer
air lock doors, skipped down the ladder, picked up the can. From the way he'd
made his landing the lake should be directly bow&#8209;on relative to the
vessel, and somewhere the other side of those distant trees. Laura took a fresh
grip on his shoulder as he started off. The can swung from his left hand. His
right hand rested warily on the gun. He was perpendicular on this world instead
of horizontal on another because, on two occasions, his hand had been ready on
the gun, and because it was the most nervous hand he possessed. The going was
rough. It wasn't so much that the terrain was craggy as the fact that impeding
growths got in his way. At one moment he was stepping over an ankle&#8209;high
shrub, the next he was facing a burly plant struggling to become a tree. Behind
the plant would be a creeper, then a natural zareba of thorns, a fuzz of fine
moss, followed by a giant fern. Progress consisted of stepping over one item,
ducking beneath a second, going around a third, and crawling under a fourth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>It occurred to him, belatedly, that if he'd
planted the ship tail&#8209;first to the lake instead of bow&#8209;on, or if
he'd let the braking rockets blow after he'd touched down, he'd have saved
himself much twisting and dodging. All this obstructing stuff would have been
reduced to ashes for at least half the distance to the lake&#8209;&#8209;together
with any venomous life it might conceal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>That last thought rang like an alarm bell
within his mind just as he doubled up to pass a low&#8209;swung creeper. On
Venus were creepers that coiled and constricted, swiftly, viciously. Macaws
played merry hell if taken within fifty yards of them. It was a comfort to know
that, this time, Laura was riding his shoulder unperturbed&#8209;&#8209;but he
kept the hand on the gun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The elusive peculiarity of the planet's
vegetation bothered him all the more as he progressed through it. His inability
to discover and name this unnamable queerness nagged at him as he went on. A
frown of self-disgust was on his lean face when he dragged himself free of a
clinging bush and sat on a rock in a tiny clearing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Dumping the can at his feet, he glowered at it
and promptly caught a glimpse of something bright and shining a few feet beyond
the can. He raised his gaze. It was then he saw the beetle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The creature was the biggest of its kind ever
seen by human eyes. There were other things bigger, of course, but not of this
type. Crabs, for instance. But this was no crab. The beetle ambling
purposefully across the clearing was large enough to give any crab a severe
inferiority complex, but it was a genuine, twenty&#8209;four&#8209;karat
beetle. And a beautiful one. Like a scarab.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Except that he clung to the notion that little
bugs were vicious and big ones companionable, Steve had no phobia about
insects. The amiability of large ones was a theory inherited from school-kid
days when he'd been the doting owner of a three&#8209;inch stag&#8209;beetle
afflicted with the name of Edgar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>So he knelt beside the creeping giant, placed
his hand palm upward in its path. It investigated the hand with waving feelers,
climbed onto his palm, paused there ruminatively. It shone with a sheen of
brilliant metallic blue and it weighed about three pounds. He jogged it on his
hand to get its weight, then put it down, let it wander on. Laura watched it go
with a sharp but incurious eye.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Scarabaeus Anderii,&quot; Steve said
with glum satisfaction. &quot;I pin my name on him&#8209;&#8209;but nobody'll
ever know it!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Dinna fash y'rsel'!&quot; shouted Laura
in a hoarse voice imported straight from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Aberdeen</st1:place></st1:City>.
&quot;Dinna fash! Stop chunnerin', wumman! Y' gie me a pain ahint ma sporran!
Dinna&#8209;&#8209;&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Shut up!&quot; Steve jerked his
shoulder, momentarily unbalancing the bird. &quot;Why d'you pick up that
barbaric dialect quicker than anything else, eh?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;McGillicuddy,&quot; shrieked Laura with
ear&#8209;splitting relish. &quot;McGilli-Gilli&#8209;Gillicuddy! The great
black&#8209;&#8209;!&quot; It ended with a word that pushed Steve's eyebrows
into his hair and surprised even the bird itself. Filming its eyes with
amazement, it tightened its claw&#8209;hold on his shoulder opened the eyes,
emitted a couple of raucous clucks, and joyfully repeated, &quot;The great
black&#8209;&#8209;&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>It didn't get the chance to complete the new
and lovely word. A violent jerk of the shoulder unseated it in the nick of time
and it fluttered to the ground, squawking protestingly. Scarabaeus Anderii
lumbered out from behind a bush, his blue armor glistening as if freshly
polished, and stared reprovingly at Laura.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Then something fifty yards away released a
snort like the trumpet of doom and took one step that shook the earth.
Scarabaeus Anderii took refuge under a projecting root. Laura made an agitated
swoop for Steve's shoulder and clung there desperately. Steve's gun was out and
pointing northward before the bird had found its perch. Another step. The
ground quivered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Silence for awhile. Steve continued to stand
like a statue. Then came a monstrous whistle more forceful than that of a
locomotive blowing off steam. Something squat and wide and of tremendous length
charged headlong through the half&#8209;concealing vegetation while the earth
trembled beneath its weight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Its mad onrush carried it blindly twenty yards
to Steve's right, the gun swinging to cover its course, but not firing. Steve
caught an extended glimpse of a slate&#8209;gray bulk with a serrated ridge on
its back which, despite the thing's pace, took long to pass. It seemed several
times the length of a fire ladder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Bushes were flung roots topmost and small
trees whipped aside as the creature pounded grimly onward in a straight line
which carried it far past the ship and into the dim distance. It left behind a
tattered swathe wide enough for a first&#8209;class road. Then the
reverberations of its mighty tonnage died out, and it was gone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Steve used his left hand to pull out a
handkerchief and wipe the back of his neck. He kept the gun in his right hand.
The explosive shells in that gun were somewhat wicked; any one of them could
deprive a rhinoceros of a hunk of meat weighing two hundred pounds. If a man
caught one, he just strewed himself over the landscape. By the looks of that
slate&#8209;colored galloper, it would need half a dozen shells to feel
incommoded. A seventy&#8209;five millimeter bazooka would be more effective for
kicking it in the back teeth, but probe ship boys don't tote around such
artillery. Steve finished the mopping, put the handkerchief back, picked up the
can.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Laura said pensively, &quot;I want my
mother.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He scowled, made no reply, set out toward the
lake. Her feathers still ruffled, Laura rode his shoulder and lapsed into surly
silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The stuff in the lake was water, cold, faintly
green and a little bitter to the taste. Coffee would camouflage the flavor. If
anything, it might improve the coffee since he liked his java bitter, but the
stuff would have to be tested before absorbing it in any quantity. Some poisons
were accumulative. It wouldn't do to guzzle gayly while building up a
death-dealing reserve of lead, for instance. Filling the freezocan, he lugged
it to the ship in hundred yard stages. The swathe helped; it made an easier
path to within short distance of the ship's tail. He was perspiring freely by
the time he reached the base of the ladder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Once inside the vessel, he relocked both
doors, opened the air vents, started the auxiliary lighting&#8209;set and
plugged in the percolator, using water out of his depleted reserve supply. The
golden sky had dulled to orange, with violet streamers creeping upward from the
horizon. Looking at it through the transpex dome, he found that the perpetual haze
still effectively concealed the sinking sun. A brighter area to one side was
all that indicated its position. He'd need his lights soon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Pulling out the collapsible table, he jammed
its supporting leg into place, plugged into its rim the short rod which was
Laura's official seat. She claimed the perch immediately, watched him beadily
as he set out her meal of water, melon seeds, sunflower seeds, pecans and
unshelled oleo nuts. Her manners were anything but ladylike and she started
eagerly, without waiting for him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>A deep frown lay across his brown, muscular
features as he sat at the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>table, poured
out his coffee and commenced to eat. It persisted through the meal, was still
there when he lit a cigarette and stared speculatively up at the dome.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Presently, he
murmured, &quot;I've seen the biggest bug that ever was. I've</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>seen a few other bugs. There were a couple of
little ones under a creeper.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>One was long
and brown and many&#8209;legged, like an earwig. The other was round and black,
with little red dots on its wing cases. I've seen a tiny purple spider and a
tinier green one of different shape, also a bug that looked like an aphid. But
not an ant.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Ant, ant,&quot; hooted Laura. She
dropped a piece of oleo nut, climbed down after it. 'awk!&quot; she added from
the floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Nor a bee.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Bee,&quot; echoed Laura, companionably.
&quot;Bee&#8209;ant. Laura loves Steve.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Still keeping his attention on the dome, he
went on, &quot;And what's cockeyed about the plants is equally cockeyed about
the bugs. I wish I could place it. Why can't I? Maybe I'm going nuts
already.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Laura loves nuts.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;I know it, you technicolored
belly!&quot; said Steve rudely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>And at that point night fell with a silent
bang. The gold and orange and violet abruptly were swamped with deep,
impenetrable blackness devoid of stars or any random gleam. Except for greenish
glowings on the instrument panel, the control room was stygian, with Laura
swearing steadily on the floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Putting out a hand, Steve switched on the
indirect lighting. Laura got to her perch with the rescued titbit, concentrated
on the job of dealing with it and let him sink back into his thoughts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Scarabaeus Anderii and a pair of smaller
bugs and a couple of spiders, all different. At the other end of the scale,
that gigantosaurus. But no ant, or bee. Or rather, no ants, no bees.&quot; The
switch from singular to plural stirred his back hairs queerly. In some vague
way, he felt that he'd touched the heart of the mystery. &quot;No ant&#8209;&#8209;no
ants,&quot; he thought. &quot;No bee&#8209;&#8209;no bees.&quot; Almost he had
it&#8209;&#8209;but still it evaded him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Giving it up for the time being, he cleared
the table, did a few minor chores. After that, he drew a standard sample from
the freezocan, put it through its paces. The bitter flavor he identified as
being due to the presence of magnesium sulphate in quantity far too small to
prove embarrassing. Drinkable&#8209;&#8209;that was something! Food, drink and
shelter were the three essentials of survival. He'd enough of the first for six
or seven weeks. The lake and the ship were his remaining guarantees of life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Finding the log, he entered the day's report,
bluntly, factually, without any embroidery. Partway through, he found himself
stuck for a name for the planet. Ander, he decided, would cost him dear if the
million&#8209;to-one chance put him back among the merciless playmates of the
Probe Service. O.K. for a bug, but not for a world. Laura wasn't so hot, either&#8209;especially
when you knew Laura. It wouldn't be seemly to name a big gold planet after an
oversized parrot. Thinking over the golden aspect of this world's sky, he hit upon
the name of Oro, promptly made the christening authoritative by entering it in
his log.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>By the time he'd finished, Laura had her head
buried deep under one wing. Occasionally she teetered and swung erect again. It
always fascinated him to watch how her balance was maintained even in her
slumbers. Studying her fondly, he remembered that unexpected addition to her
vocabulary. This shifted his thoughts to a fiery&#8209;headed and
fierier-tongued individual named Menzies, the sworn foe of another volcano
named McGillicuddy. If ever the opportunity presented itself, he decided, the
educative work of said Menzies was going to be rewarded with a bust on the
snoot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Sighing, he put away the log, wound up the
forty&#8209;day chronometer, opened his folding bunk and lay down upon it. His
hand switched off the lights. Ten years back, a first landing would have kept
him awake all night in dithers of excitement. He'd got beyond that now. He'd
done it often enough to have grown phlegmatic about it. His eyes closed in
preparation for a good night's sleep, and he did sleep&#8209;&#8209;for two
hours.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>What brought him awake within that short time
he didn't know, but suddenly he found himself sitting bolt upright on the edge
of the bunk, his ears and nerves stretched to their utmost, his legs quivering
in a way they'd never done before. His whole body fizzed with that queer
mixture of palpitation and shock which follows narrow escape from disaster.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>This was something not within previous
experience. Sure and certain in the intense darkness, his hand sought and found
his gun. He cuddled the butt in his palm while his mind strove to recall a
possible nightmare, though he knew he was not given to nightmares.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Laura moved restlessly on her perch, not truly
awake, yet not asleep, and this was unusual in her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Rejecting the dream theory, he stood up on the
bunk, looked out through the dome. Blackness, the deepest, darkest, most
impenetrable blackness it was possible to conceive. And silence! The outside
world slumbered in the blackness and the silence as in a sable shroud.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Yet never before had he felt so wide awake in
this, his normal sleeping time. Puzzled, he turned slowly round to take in the
full circle of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>unseeable view, and at one point he halted.
The surrounding darkness</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>was not complete. In the distance beyond the
ship's tail moved a tall,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>stately glow. How far off it might be was not
possible to estimate, but</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>the sight of it stirred his soul and caused
his heart to leap.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Uncontrollable emotions were not permitted to master
his disciplined mind. Narrowing his eyes, he tried to discern the nature of the
glow while his mind sought the reason why the mere sight of it should make him
twang like a harp. Bending down, he felt at the head of the bunk, found a
leather case, extracted a pair of powerful night glasses. The glow was still
moving, slowly, deliberately, from right to left. He got the glasses on it,
screwed the lenses into focus, and the phenomenon leaped into closer view.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The thing was a great column of golden haze
much like that of the noonday sky except that small, intense gleams of silver
sparkled within it. It was a shaft of lustrous mist bearing a sprinkling of
tiny stars. It was like nothing known to or recorded by any form of life lower
than the gods. But was it life?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>It moved, though its mode of locomotion could
not be determined. Self&#8209;motivation is the prime symptom of life. It could
be life, conceivably though not credibly, from the Terrestrial viewpoint.
Consciously, he preferred to think it a strange and purely local feature
comparable with Saharan sand&#8209;devils. Subconsciously, he knew it was life,
tall and terrifying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He kept the glasses on it while slowly it
receded into the darkness, foreshortening with increasing distance and
gradually fading from view. To the very last the observable field shifted and
shuddered as he failed to control the quiver in his hands. And when the
sparkling haze had gone leaving only a pall over his lenses, he sat down on the
bunk and shivered with eerie cold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Laura was dodging to and fro along her perch,
now thoroughly awake and agitated, but he wasn't inclined to switch on the
lights and make the dome a beacon in the night. His hand went out, feeling for
her in the darkness, and she clambered eagerly onto his wrist, thence to his
lap. She was fussy and demonstrative, pathetically yearning for comfort and
companionship. He scratched her poll and fondled her while she pressed close
against his chest with funny little crooning noises. For some time e soothed
her and, while doing it, fell asleep. Gradually he slumped backward on the
bunk. Laura perched on his forearm, clucked tiredly, put her head under a wing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>There was no further awakening until the outer
blackness disappeared and the sky again sent its golden glow pouring through
the dome Steve got up, stood on the bunk, had a good look over the surrounding
terrain. It remained precisely the same as it had been the day before Things
stewed within his mind while he got his breakfast; especially the jumpiness
he'd experienced in the nighttime. Laura also was subdued and quiet. Only once
before had she been like that&#8209;&#8209;which was when he'd traipsed through
the Venusian section of the Panplanetary Zoo and had shown her a crested eagle.
The eagle had stared at her with contemptuous dignity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Though he'd all the time in his life, he now
felt a peculiar urge to hasten. Getting the gun and the freezocan, he made a
full dozen trips to the lake, wasting no minutes, nor stopping to study the
still enigmatic plants and bugs. It was late in the afternoon by the time he'd
filled the ship's fifty&#8209;gallon reservoir, and had the satisfaction of
knowing that he'd got a drinkable quota to match his food supply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>There had been no sign of gigantosaurus or any
other animal. Once he'd seen something flying in the far distance, birdlike or
batlike. Laura had cocked a sharp eye at it but betrayed no undue interest.
Right now she was more concerned with a new fruit. Steve sat in the rim of the
outer lock door, his legs dangling, and watched her clambering over a small
tree thirty yards away. The gun lay in his lap; he was ready to take a crack at
anything which might be ready to take a crack at Laura.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The bird sampled the tree's fruit, a crop
resembling blue&#8209;shelled lychee nuts. She ate one with relish, grabbed
another. Steve lay back in the lock, stretched to reach a bag, then dropped to
the ground and went across to the tree. He tried a nut. Its flesh was soft,
juicy, sweet and citrous. He filled the bag with the fruit, slung it into the
ship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Nearby stood another tree, not quite the same,
but very similar. It bore nuts like the first except that they were larger.
Picking one, he offered it to Laura who tried it, spat it out in disgust.
Picking a second, he slit it, licked the flesh gingerly. As far as he could
tell, it was the same. Evidently he couldn't tell far enough: Laura's diagnosis
said it was not the same. The difference, too subtle for him to detect, might
be sufficient to roll him up like a hoop and keep him that shape to the
unpleasant end. He flung the thing away, went back to his seat in the lock, and
ruminated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>That elusive, nagging feature of Oro's plants
and bugs could be narrowed down to these two nuts. He felt sure of that. If he
could discover why&#8209;&#8209;parrotwise&#8209;&#8209;one nut was a nut while
the other nut was not, he'd have his finger right on the secret. The more he
thought about those similar fruits the more he felt that, in sober fact, his
finger was on the secret already&#8209;&#8209;but he lacked the power to lift
it and see what lay beneath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Tantalizingly, his mulling&#8209;over the
subject landed him the same place</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>as before; namely, nowhere. It got his dander
up, and he went back to the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>trees, subjected both to close examination.
His sense of sight told him</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>that they were different individuals of the
same species. Laura's sense of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>whatchamacallit insisted that they were
different species. Ergo, you can't believe the evidence of your eyes. He was
aware of that fact, of course, since it was a platitude of the spaceways, but
when you couldn't trust your optics it was legitimate to try to discover just
why you couldn't trust 'em. And he couldn't discover even that!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>It soured him so much that he returned to the
ship, locked its doors, called Laura back to his shoulder and set off on a
tailward exploration. The rules of first landings were simple and sensible. Go
in slowly, come out quickly, and remember that all we want from you is evidence
of suitability for human life. Thoroughly explore a small area rather than
scout a big one&#8209;&#8209;the mapping parties will do the rest. Use your
ship as a base and centralize it where you can live&#8209;&#8209;don't move it
unnecessarily. Restrict your trips to a radius representing daylight&#8209;reach
and lock yourself in after dark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>was Oro suitable for human life? The unwritten
law was that you don't jump to conclusions and say, &quot;Of course! I'm still
living, aren't I?&quot; Cameron, who'd plonked his ship on Mithra, for
instance, thought he'd found paradise until, on the seventeenth day, he'd
discovered the fungoid plague. He'd left like a bat out of hell and had spent
three sweaty, swearing days in the Lunar Purification Plant before becoming fit
for society. The authorities had vaporized his ship. Mithra had been taboo ever
since. Every world a potential trap baited with scenic delight. The job of the
Probe Service was to enter the traps and jounce on the springs. Another dollop
of real estate for Terra&#8209;&#8209;if nothing broke your neck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Maybe Oro was loaded for bear. The thing that
walked in the night, Steve mused, bore awful suggestion of nonhuman power. So
did a waterspout, and whoever heard of anyone successfully wrestling with a
waterspout? If this Oro&#8209;spout were sentient, so much the worse for human
prospects. He'd have to get the measure of it, he decided, even if he had to
chase it through the blank avenues of night. Plodding steadily away from the
tail, gun in hand, he pondered so deeply that he entirely overlooked the fact
that he wasn't on a pukka probe job anyway, and that nothing else remotely
human might reach Oro in a thousand years. Even space&#8209;boys can be
creatures of habit. Their job: to look for death; they were liable to go on
looking long after the need had passed, in bland disregard of the certainty
that if you look for a thing long enough, ultimately you find it!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The ship's chronometer had given him five
hours to darkness. Two and a half hours each way; say ten miles out and ten
back. The water had consumed his time. On the morrow, and henceforth, he'd
increase the radius to twelve and take it easier.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Then all thoughts fled from his mind as he
came to the edge of the vegetation. The stuff didn't dribble out of existence
with hardy spurs and offshoots fighting for a hold in rocky ground. It stopped
abruptly, in light loam, as if cut off with a machete, and from where it
stopped spread a different crop. The new growths were tiny and crystalline.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He accepted the crystalline crop without
surprise, knowing that novelty was the inevitable feature of any new locale.
Things were ordinary only by Terrestrial standards. Outside of Terra, nothing was
supernormal or abnormal except insofar as they failed to jibe with their own
peculiar conditions. Besides, there were crystalline growths on Mars. The one
unacceptable feature of the situation was the way in which vegetable growths
ended and crystalline ones began. He stepped back to the verge and made another
startled survey of the borderline. It was so straight that the sight screwed
his brain around. Like a field. A cultivated field. Dead straightness of that
sort couldn't be other than artificial. Little beads of moisture popped out on
his back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Squatting on the heel of his right boot, he
gazed at the nearest crystals and said to Laura, &quot;Chicken, I think these
things got planted. Question is, who planted 'em?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;McGillicuddy,&quot; suggested Laura
brightly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Putting out a finger, he flicked the crystal
sprouting near the toe of his boot, a green, branchy object an inch high.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The crystal vibrated and said,
&quot;Zing!&quot; in a sweet, high voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He flicked its neighbor, and that said,
&quot;Zang!&quot; in lower tone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He flicked a third. It emitted no note, but
broke into a thousand shards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Standing up, he scratched his head, making
Laura fight for a clawhole within the circle of his arm. One zinged and one zanged
and one returned to dust. Two nuts. Zings and zangs and nuts. It was right in
his grasp if only he could open his hand and look at what he'd got.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Then he lifted his puzzled and slightly ireful
gaze, saw something fluttering erratically across the crystal field. It was
making for the vegetation. Laura took off with a raucous cackle, her blue and
crimson wings beating powerfully. She swooped over the object, frightening it
so low that it dodged and sideslipped only a few feet above Steve's head. He saw
that it was a large butterfly, frill&#8209;winged, almost as gaudy as Laura.
The bird swooped again, scaring the insect but not menacing it. He called her
back, set out to cross the area ahead. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Crystals</st1:place></st1:City>
crunched to powder under his heavy boots as he tramped on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Half an hour later he was toiling up a steep,
crystal&#8209;coated slope when his thoughts suddenly jelled and he stopped
with such abruptness that Laura spilled from his shoulder and perforce took to
wing. She beat round in a circle, came back to her perch, made bitter remarks
in an unknown language.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;One of this and one of that,&quot; he
said. &quot;No twos or threes or dozens. Nothing I've seen has repeated itself.
There's only one gigantosaurus, only one Scarabaeus Anderii, only one of every
other danged thing. Every item is unique, original, and an individual creation
in its own right. What does that suggest?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;McGillicuddy,&quot; offered Laura.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;For Pete's sake, forget
McGillicuddy.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;For Pete's sake, for Pete's sake,&quot;
yelled Laura, much taken by the phrase. &quot;The great black&#8209;&#8209;&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Again he upset her in the nick of time, making
her take to flight while he continued talking to himself. &quot;It suggests
constant and all&#8209;pervading mutation. Everything breeds something quite
different from itself and there aren't any dominant strains.&quot; He frowned
at the obvious snag in this theory. &quot;But how the blazes does anything
breed? What fertilizes which?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;McGilli&#8209;&#8209;,&quot; began
Laura, then changed her mind and shut up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Anyway, if nothing breeds true, it'll be
tough on the food problem,&quot; he went on. 'What's edible on one plant may be
a killer on its offspring. Today's fodder is tomorrow's poison. How's a farmer
to know what he's going to get? Hey&#8209;hey, if I'm guessing right, this
planet won't support a couple of hogs.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;No, sir. No hogs. Laura loves
hogs.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Be quiet,&quot; he snapped. &quot;Now,
what shouldn't support a couple of hogs demonstrably does support gigantosaurus&#8209;&#8209;and
any other fancy animals which may be mooching around. It seems crazy to me. On
Venus or any other place full of consistent fodder, gigantosaurus would thrive,
but here, according to my calculations, the big lunk has no right to be alive.
He ought to be dead.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>So saying, he topped the rise and found the
monster in question sprawling right across the opposite slope. It was dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The way in which he determined its deadness
was appropriately swift, simple and effective. Its enormous bulk lay draped
across the full length of the slope and its dragon&#8209;head, the size of a
lifeboat, pointed toward him. The head had two dull, lackluster eyes like
dinner plates. He planted a shell smack in the right eye and a sizable hunk of
noggin promptly splashed in all directions. The body did not stir.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>There was a shell ready for the other eye
should the creature leap to frantic, vengeful life, but the mighty hulk
remained supine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>His boots continued to desiccate crystals as
he went down the slope, curved a hundred yards off his route to get around the
corpse, and trudged up the farther rise. Momentarily, he wasn't much interested
in the dead beast. Time was short and he could come again tomorrow, bringing a
full&#8209;color stereoscopic camera with him. Gigantosaurus would go on record
in style, but would have to wait.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>This second rise was a good deal higher, and
more trying a climb. Its crest represented the approximate limit of this day's
trip, and he felt anxious to surmount it before turning back. Humanity's
characteristic urge to see what lay over the hill remained as strong as on the
day determined ancestors topped the <st1:place w:st="on">Rockies</st1:place>.
He had to have a look, firstly because elevation gave range to the vision, and
secondly because of that prowler in the night&#8209;&#8209;and, nearly as he
could estimate, the prowler had gone down behind this rise. A column of mist,
sucked down from the sky, might move around aimlessly, going nowhere, but
instinct maintained that this had been no mere column of mist, and that it was
going somewhere.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Where?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Out of breath, he pounded over the crest,
looked down into an immense valley, and found the answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The crystal growths gave out on the crest,
again in a perfectly straight line. Beyond them the light loam, devoid of rock,
ran gently down to the valley and up the farther side. Both slopes were
sparsely dotted with queer, jellylike lumps of matter which lay and quivered
beneath the sky's golden glow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>From the closed end of the valley jutted a
great, glistening fabrication, fiat&#8209;roofed, fiat&#8209;fronted, with a
huge, square hole gaping in its mid&#8209;section at front. It looked like a
tremendous oblong slab of polished, milk&#8209;white plastic half&#8209;buried
endwise in a sandy hill. No decoration disturbed its smooth, gleaming surface.
No road led to the hole in front. Somehow, it had the new&#8209;old air of a
house that struggles to look empty because it is full&#8209;&#8209;of fiends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Steve's back hairs prickled as he studied it.
One thing was obvious&#8209;Oro bore intelligent life. One thing was possible&#8209;&#8209;the
golden column represented that life. One thing was probable&#8209;&#8209;fleshly
Terrestrials and hazy Orons would have difficulty in finding a basis for
friendship and cooperation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Whereas enmity needs no basis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Curiosity and caution pulled him opposite
ways. One urged him down into the valley while the other drove him back, back,
while yet there was time He consulted his watch. Less than three hours to go,
within which he had to return to the ship, enter the log, prepare supper. That
milky creation was at least two miles away, a good hour's journey there and back.
Let it wait. Give it another day and he'd have more time for it, with the
benefit of needful thought between times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Caution
triumphed. He investigated the nearest jellyblob. It was flat, a yard in
diameter, green, with bluish streaks and many tiny bubbles hiding in its
semi-transparency. The thing pulsated slowly. He poked it with the toe of his
boot, and it contracted, humping itself in the middle, <span class=GramE>then</span>
sluggishly relaxed. No amoeba, he decided. A low form of life, but complicated
withal. Laura didn't like the object. She skittered off as he bent over it,
vented her anger by bashing a few crystals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>This jello dollop wasn't like its nearest
neighbor, or like any other. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
class=GramE>One of each, only one.</span> The same rule: one butterfly of a
kind, one bug, one plant, one of these quivering things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>A final stare at the distant mystery down in
the valley, then he retraced his steps. When the ship came into sight he
speeded up like a gladsome voyager nearing home. There were new prints near the
vessel, big, three&#8209;toed, deeply&#8209;impressed spoor which revealed that
something large, heavy and two&#8209;legged had wandered past in his absence.
Evidently an animal, for nothing intelligent would have meandered on so
casually without circling and inspecting the nearby invader from space. He
dismissed it from his mind. There was only one thingumabob, he felt certain of
that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Once inside the ship, he relocked the doors,
gave Laura her feed, ate his supper. Then he dragged out the log, made his
day's entry, <span class=GramE>had</span> a look around from the dome. Violet
streamers once more were creeping upward from the horizon. He frowned at the
encompassing vegetation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>What sort of
stuff had bred all this in the past? What sort of stuff would this breed in the
future? How did it progenerate, anyway?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Wholesale radical mutation presupposed
modification of genes by hard radiation in persistent and considerable blasts.
You shouldn't get hard radiation on lightweight planets&#8209;&#8209;unless it
poured in from the sky.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Here, it didn't
pour from the sky, or from any place else. In fact, there wasn't any.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He was pretty certain of that fact because he'd
a special interest in it and had checked up on it. Hard radiation betokened the
presence of radioactive elements which, at a pinch, might be usable as fuel.
The ship was equipped to detect such stuff. Among the junk was a cosmiray counter,
a radium hen, and a gold&#8209;leaf electroscope. The hen and the counter
hadn't given so much as one heartening <span class=GramE>cluck,</span> in fact
the only clucks had been Laura's. The electroscope he'd charged on landing and
its leaves still formed an inverted V. The air was dry, ionization negligible,
and the leaves didn't look likely to collapse for a week.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Something's wrong with my
theorizing,&quot; he complained to Laura. &quot;My think&#8209;stuff's not
doing its job.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Not doing its job,&quot; echoed Laura
faithfully. She cracked a pecan with a grating noise that set his teeth on
edge. &quot;I tell you it's a hoodoo skip. I won't sail. No, not even if you
pray for me. I won't, I won't, I won't. Nope. Nix. Who's drunk? That hairy
Lowlander Mc&#8209;&#8209;&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Laura!&quot; he said sharply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Gillicuddy,&quot; she finished with bland
defiance. Again she rasped his teeth. &quot;Rings bigger'n Saturn's. I saw them
myself. Who's a liar? Yawk! She's down in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Grayway</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Bay</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>,
on Tethis. Boy, what a torso!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He looked at her hard and said, &quot;You're
nuts!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Sure! Sure, pal! Laura loves nuts. Have
one on me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;O.K.,&quot; he accepted, holding out his
hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Cocking her colorful pate, she pecked at his
hand, gravely selected a pecan and gave it to him. He cracked it, chewed on the
kernel while starting up the lighting&#8209;set. It was almost as if night were
waiting for him. Blackness fell even as he switched on the lights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>With the darkness came a keen sense of unease.
The dome was the trouble. It blazed like a beacon and there was no way of
blacking it out except by turning off the lights. Beacons attracted things, and
he'd no desire to become a center of attraction in present circumstances. That
is to say, not at night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Long experience had bred fine contempt for
alien animals, no matter how whacky, but outlandish intelligences were a
different proposition. So filled was he with the strange inward conviction that
last night's phenomenon was something that knew its onions that it didn't occur
to him to wonder whether a glowing column possessed eyes or anything equivalent
to a sense of sight. If it had occurred to him, he'd have derived no comfort
from it. His desire to be weighed in the balance in some eerie, extrasensory
way was even less than his desire to be gaped at visually in his slumbers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>An unholy mess of thoughts and ideas was still
cooking in his mind when he extinguished the lights, bunked down and went to
sleep. Nothing disturbed him this time, but when he awoke with the golden dawn
his chest was damp with perspiration and Laura again had sought refuge on his
arm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Digging out breakfast, his thoughts began to
marshal themselves as he kept his hands busy. Pouring out a shot of hot coffee,
he spoke to Laura.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;I'm durned if I'm going to go scatty
trying to maintain a three&#8209;watch system single&#8209;handed, which is
what I'm supposed to do if faced by powers unknown when I'm not able to beat
it. Those armchair warriors at headquarters ought to get a taste of situations
not precisely specified in the book of rules.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Burp!&quot; said Laura contemptuously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;He who fights and runs away lives to
fight another day,&quot; Steve quoted. &quot;That's the Probe Law. It's a nice,
smooth, lovely law&#8209;&#8209;when you can run away. We can't!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Burrup!&quot; said Laura with
unnecessary emphasis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;For a woman, your manners are downright
disgusting,&quot; he told her. &quot;Now I'm not going to spend the brief
remainder of my life looking fearfully over my shoulder. The only way to get
rid of powers unknown is to convert 'em into powers known and understood. As
Uncle Joe told Willie when dragging him to the dentist, the longer we put it
off the worse it'll feel.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Dinna fash y'rsel',&quot; declaimed
Laura. &quot;Burp&#8209;gollop&#8209;bop!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Giving her a look of extreme distaste, he
continued, &quot;So we'll try tossing the bull. Such techniques disconcert
bulls sometimes.&quot; Standing up, he grabbed Laura, shoved her into her traveling
compartment, slid the panel shut. &quot;We're going to blow off
forthwith.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Climbing up to the control seat, he stamped on
the energizer stud. The tail rockets popped a few times, broke into a subdued
roar. Juggling the controls to get the preparatory feel of them, he stepped up
the boost until the entire vessel trembled and the rear venturis began to glow
cherry&#8209;red. Slowly the ship commenced to edge its bulk forward and, as it
did so, he fed it the take&#8209;off shot. A half&#8209;mile blast kicked
backward and the probe ship plummeted into the sky.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Pulling it round in a wide and shallow sweep,
he thundered over the borderline of vegetation, the fields of crystals and the
hills beyond. In a flash he was plunging through the valley, braking rockets
blazing from the nose. This was tricky. He had to co&#8209;ordinate forward
shoot, backward thrust and downward surge, but like most of his kind he took
pride in the stunts performable with these neat little vessels. An awe&#8209;inspired
audience was all he lacked to make the exhibition perfect. The vessel landed
fairly and squarely on the milk&#8209;white roof of the alien edifice, slid
halfway to the cliff, then stopped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Boy,&quot; he breathed, &quot;am I
good!&quot; He remained in his seat, stared around through the dome, and felt
that he ought to add, &quot;And too young to die.&quot; Occasionally eying the
chronometer, he waited awhile. The boat must have handed that roof a thump
sufficient to wake the dead. If anyone were in, they'd soon hotfoot out to see
who was heaving hundred&#8209;ton bottles at their shingles. Nobody emerged. He
gave them half an hour, his hawklike face strained, alert. Then he gave it up,
said, &quot;Ah, well,&quot; and got out of the seat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He freed Laura. She came out with ruffled
dignity, like a dowager who's paraded into the wrong room. Females were always
curious critters, in his logic, and he ignored her attitude, got his gun,
unlocked the doors, jumped down onto the roof. Laura followed reluctantly, came
to his shoulder as if thereby conferring a great favor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Walking past the tail to the edge of the roof,
he looked down. The sheerness of the five&#8209;hundred&#8209;foot drop took
him aback. Immediately below his feet, the entrance soared four hundred feet up
from the ground and he was standing on the hundred&#8209;foot lintel
surmounting it. The only way down was to walk to the side of the roof and reach
the earthy slope in which the building was embedded, seeking a path down that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He covered a quarter of a mile of roof to get
to the slope, his eyes examining the roof's surface as he went, and failing to
find one crack or joint in the uniformly smooth surface. Huge as it was, the
erection appeared to have been molded all in one piece&#8209;&#8209;a fact
which did nothing to lessen inward misgivings. Whoever did this mighty job
weren't Zulus!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>From ground level the entrance loomed bigger
than ever. If there had been a similar gap at the other side of the building,
and a clear way through, he could have taken the ship in at one end and out at
the other as easily as threading a needle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Absence of doors didn't seem peculiar; it was
difficult to imagine any sort of door huge enough to fill this opening yet
sufficiently balanced to enable anyone&#8209;&#8209;or anything&#8209;&#8209;to
pull open or shut. With a final, cautious look around which revealed nothing
moving in the valley, he stepped boldly through the entrance, blinked his eyes,
found interior darkness slowly fading as visual retention lapsed and gave up
remembrance of the golden glow outside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>There was a glow inside, a different one,
paler, ghastlier, greenish. It exuded from the floor, the walls, the ceiling,
and the total area of radiation was enough to light the place clearly, with no
shadows. He sniffed as his vision adjusted itself. There was a strong smell of
ozone mixed with other, unidentifiable odors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>To his right and left, rising hundreds of
feet, stood great tiers of transparent cases. He went to the ones on his right
and examined them. They were cubes, about a yard each way, made of something
like transpex. Each contained three inches of loam from which sprouted a
crystal. No two crystals were alike; some small and branchy, others large and
indescribably complicated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Dumb with thought, he went around to the back
of the monster tier, found another ten yards behind it. And another behind
that. And another and another. All with crystals. The number and variety of
them made his head whirl. He could study only the two bottom rows of each rack,
but row on row stepped themselves far above his head to within short distance
of the roof. Their total number was beyond estimation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>It was the same on the left. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Crystals</st1:place></st1:City> by the thousands. Looking more
closely at one especially fine example, he noticed that the front plate of its
case bore a small, inobtrusive pattern of dots etched upon the outer surface.
Investigation revealed that all cases were similarly marked, differing only in
the number and arrangement of the dots. Undoubtedly, some sort of cosmic code
used for classification purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;The Oron Museum of Natural
History,&quot; he guessed, in a whisper.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;You're a liar,&quot; squawked Laura
violently. &quot;I tell you it's a hoodoo&#8209;&#8209;&quot; She stopped,
dumfounded, as her own voice roared through the building in deep, organlike
tones, &quot;A hoodoo&#8209;&#8209;A hoodoo&#8209;&#8209;&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Holy smoke, will you keep quiet!&quot;
hissed Steve. He tried to keep watch on the exit and the interior simultaneously.
But the voice rumbled away in the distance without bringing anyone to dispute
their invasion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Turning, he paced hurriedly past the first
blocks of tiers to the next batteries of exhibits. Jelly blobs in this lot.
Small ones, no bigger than his wrist watch, numberable in thousands. None
appeared to be alive, he noted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Sections three, four and five took him a mile
into the building as nearly as he could estimate. He passed mosses, lichens and
shrubs, all dead but wondrously preserved. By this time he was ready to guess
at section six&#8209;plants. He was wrong. The sixth layout displayed bugs,
including moths, butterflies, and strange, unfamiliar objects resembling
chitinous humming&#8209;birds. There was no sample of Scarabaeus Anderii,
unless it were several hundred feet up. Or unless there was an empty box ready
for it&#8209;when its day was done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Who made the boxes? Had it prepared one for
him? One for Laura? He visualized himself, petrified forever, squatting in the
seventieth case of the twenty&#8209;fifth row of the tenth tier in section
something&#8209;or&#8209;other, his front panel duly tagged with its
appropriate dots. It was a lousy picture. It made his forehead wrinkle to think
of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Looking for he knew not what, he plunged
steadily on, advancing deeper and deeper into the heart of the building. Not a
soul, not a sound,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>not a
footprint. Only that all&#8209;pervading smell and the unvarying glow. He had a
feeling that the place was visited frequently but never occupied for any worth&#8209;while
period of time. Without bothering to stop and look, he passed an enormous case
containing a creature faintly resembling a bison&#8209;headed rhinoceros, then
other, still larger cases holding equally larger exhibits&#8209;&#8209;all
carefully dot&#8209;marked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Finally, he rounded a box so tremendous that
it sprawled across the full width of the hall. It contained the grand&#8209;pappy
of all trees and the great&#8209;grand&#8209;pappy of all serpents. Behind, for
a change, reared five hundred feet high racks of metal cupboards, each cupboard
with a stud set in its polished door, each ornamented with more groups of
mysteriously arranged dots.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Greatly daring, he pressed the stud on the
nearest cupboard and its door swung open with a juicy click. The result proved
disappointing. The cupboard was filled with stacks of small, glassy sheets each
smothered with dots.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Super filing&#8209;system,&quot; he
grunted, closing the door. &quot;Old Prof Heggarty would give his right arm to
be here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Heggarty,&quot; said Laura, in a
faltering voice. &quot;For Pete's sake!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He looked at her sharply. She was ruffled and fidgety,
showing signs of increasing agitation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>'What's the matter, Chicken&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>She peeked at him, returned her anxious gaze
the way they had come, side&#8209;stepped to and fro on his shoulder. Her neck
feathers started to rise. A nervous cluck came from her beak and she cowered
close to his jacket.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Darn!&quot; he muttered. Spinning on one
heel, he raced past successive filing blocks, got into the ten yards' space
between the end block and the wall. His gun was out and he kept watch on the front
of the blocks while his free hand tried to soothe Laura. She snuggled up close,
rubbing her head into his neck and trying to hide under the angle of his jaw.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Quiet, Honey,&quot; he whispered.
&quot;Just you keep quiet and stay with Steve, and we'll be all right.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>She kept quiet, though she'd begun to tremble.
His heart speeded up in sympathy though he could see nothing, hear nothing to
warrant it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Then, while he watched and waited, and still
in absolute silence, the interior brightness waxed, became less green, more
golden. And suddenly he knew what it was that was coming. He knew what it was!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He sank on one knee to make himself as small
and inconspicuous as possible. Now his heart was palpitating wildly and no
coldness in his mind could freeze it down to slower, more normal beat. The
silence, the awful silence of its approach was the unbearable feature. The
crushing thud of a weighty foot or hoof would have been better. Colossi have no
right to steal along like ghosts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>And the golden glow built up, drowning out the
green radiance from floor to roof, setting the multitude of case&#8209;surfaces
afire with its brilliance. It grew as strong as the golden sky, and stronger.
It became all&#8209;pervading, unendurable, leaving no darkness in which to
hide, no sanctuary for little things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>It flamed like the rising sun or like
something drawn from the heart of a sun, and the glory of its radiance sent the
cowering watcher's mind awhirl. He struggled fiercely to control his brain, to
discipline it, to bind it to his fading will&#8209;&#8209;and failed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>With drawn face beaded by sweat, Steve caught
the merest fragmentary glimpse of the column's edge appearing from between the
stacks of the center aisle. He saw a blinding strip of burnished gold in which
glittered a pure white star, then a violent effervescence seemed to occur
within his brain and he fell forward into a cloud of tiny bubbles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Down, down he sank through myriad bubbles and
swirls and sprays of iridescent froth and foam which shone and changed and
shone anew with every conceivable color. And all the time his mind strove
frantically to battle upward and drag his soul to the surface.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Deep into the nethermost reaches he went while
still the bubbles whirled around in their thousands and their colors were of
numberless hues. Then his progress slowed. Gradually the froth and the foam
ceased to rotate upward, stopped its circling, began to swirl in the reverse
direction and sink. He was rising! He rose for a lifetime, floating
weightlessly, in a dreamlike trance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The last of the bubbles drifted eerily away,
leaving him in a brief hiatus of nonexistence&#8209;&#8209;then he found
himself sprawled full length on the floor with a dazed Laura clinging to his
arm. He blinked his eyes, slowly, several times. They were strained and sore.
His heart was still palpitating and his legs felt weak. There was a strange
sensation in his stomach as if memory had sickened him with a shock from long,
long ago.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He didn't get up from the floor right away;
his body was too shaken and his mind too muddled for that. While his wits came
back and his composure returned, he lay and noted that all the invading
goldness had gone and that again the interior illumination was a dull,
shadowless green. Then his eyes found his watch and he sat up, startled. Two
hours had flown!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>That fact brought him shakily to his feet.
Peering around the end of the bank of filing cabinets, he saw that nothing had
changed. Instinct told him that the golden visitor had gone and that once more
he had this place to himself. Had it become aware of his presence? Had it made
him lose consciousness or, if not, why had he lost it? Had it done anything
about the ship on the roof?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Picking up his futile gun, he spun it by its
stud guard and looked at it with contempt. Then he holstered it, helped Laura
onto his shoulder where she perched groggily, went around the back of the racks
and still deeper into the building.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;I reckon we're O.K., Honey,&quot; he
told her. &quot;I think we're too small to be noticed. We're like mice. Who
bothers to trap mice when he's got bigger and more important things in
mind?&quot; He pulled a face, not liking the mouse comparison. It wasn't
flattering either to him or his kind. But it was the best he could think of at
the moment. &quot;So, like little mice, let's for cheese. I'm not giving up
just because a big hunk of something has sneaked past and put a scare into us.
We don't scare off, do we, Sweetness?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;No,&quot; said Laura unenthusiastically.
Her voice was still subdued and her eyes perked apprehensively this way and
that. &quot;No scare. I won't sail, I tell you. Blow my sternpipes! Laura loves
nuts!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Don't you call me a nut!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Nuts! Stick to farming&#8209;&#8209;it
gets you more eggs. McGillicuddy, the great&#8209;&#8209;&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Hey!&quot; he warned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>She shut up abruptly. He put the pace on,
refusing to admit that his system felt slightly jittery with nervous strain or
that anything had got him bothered. But he knew that he'd no desire to be near
that sparkling giant again. Once was enough, more than enough. It wasn't that
he feared it, but something else, something he was quite unable to define.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Passing the last bank of cabinets, he found
himself facing a machine. It was complicated and bizarre&#8209;&#8209;and it
was making a crystalline growth. Near it, another and different machine was
manufacturing a small, horned lizard. There could be no doubt at all about the
process of fabrication because both objects were half&#8209;made and both
progressed slightly even as he watched. In a couple of hours' time, perhaps
less, they'd be finished, and all they'd need would be . . . would be--</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The hairs stiffened on the back of his neck
and he commenced to run. Endless machines, all different, all making different
things, plants, bugs, birds and fungoids. It was done by electroponics, atom
fed to atom like brick after brick to build a house. It wasn't synthesis
because that's only assembly, and this was assembly plus growth in response to
unknown</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>laws. In each
of these machines, he knew, was some key or code or cipher, some weird master&#8209;control
of unimaginable complexity, determining the patterns each was building&#8209;&#8209;and
the patterns were infinitely variable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Here and there a piece of apparatus stood
silent, inactive, their tasks complete. Here and there other monstrous layouts
were in pieces, either under repair or readied for modification. He stopped by
one which had finished its job. It had fashioned a delicately shaded moth which
perched motionless like a jeweled statue within its fabrication jar. The
creature was perfect as far as he could tell, and all it was waiting for was .
. . was&#8209;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Beads of moisture popped out on his forehead.
All that moth needed was the breath of life!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He forced a multitude of notions to get out of
his mind. It was the only way to retain a hold on himself. Divert your
attention&#8209;&#8209;take it off this and place it on that! Firmly, he fastened
his attention on one tremendous, partly disassembled machine lying nearby. Its
guts were exposed, revealing great field coils of dull gray wire. Bits of
similar wire lay scattered around on the floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Picking up a short piece, he found it
surprisingly heavy. He took off his wrist watch, opened its back, brought the
wire near to its works. The Venusian jargoon bearing fluoresced immediately. V&#8209;jargoons
invariably glowed in the presence of near radiation. This unknown metal was a
possible fuel. His heart gave a jump at the mere thought of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Should he drag out a huge coil and lug it up
to the ship? It was very heavy, and he'd need a considerable length of the
stuff&#8209;&#8209;if it was usable as fuel. Supposing the disappearance of the
coil caused mousetraps to be set before he returned to search anew?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>It pays to stop and think whenever you've got
time to stop and think; that was a fundamental of Probe Service philosophy.
Pocketing a sample of the wire, he sought around other disassembled machines
for more. The search took him still deeper into the building and he fought
harder to keep his attention concentrated solely on the task. It wasn't easy.
There was that dog, for instance, standing there, statue-like, waiting,
waiting. If only it had been anything but indubitably and recognizably an
Earth-type dog. It was impossible to avoid seeing it. It would be equally
impossible to avoid seeing other, even more familiar forms&#8209;&#8209;if they
were there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He'd gained seven samples of different radioactive
wires when he gave up the search. A cockatoo ended his peregrinations. The bird
stood steadfastly in its jar, its blue plumage smooth and bright, its crimson
crest raised, its bright eye fixed in what was not death but not yet life.
Laura shrieked at it hysterically and the immense hall shrieked back at her
with long&#8209;drawn roars and rumbles that reverberated into dim distances.
Laura's reaction was too much; he wanted no cause for similar reaction of his
own.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He sped through the building at top pace, passing
the filing cabinets and the mighty array of exhibition cases unheedingly. Up
the loamy side slopes he climbed almost as rapidly as he'd gone down, and he
was breathing heavily by the time he got into the ship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>His first action was to check the ship for
evidence of interference. There wasn't any. Next, he checked the instruments.
The Electroscope's leaves were collapsed. Charging them, he watched them flip
open and flop together again. The counter showed radiation aplenty. The hen
clucked energetically. He'd blundered somewhat&#8209;&#8209;he should have
checked up when first he landed on the roof. However, no matter. What lay
beneath the roof was now known; the instruments would have advised him earlier
but not as informatively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Laura had her feed while he accompanied her
with a swift meal. After that, he dug out his samples of wire. No two were the
same gauge and one obviously was far too thick to enter the feed holes of the
Kingston-Kanes. It took him half an hour to file it down to a suitable
diameter. The original piece of dull gray wire took the first test. Feeding it
in, he set the controls to minimum warming&#8209;up intensity, stepped on the
energizer. Nothing happened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He scowled to himself. Someday they'd have
jobs better than the sturdy but finicky Kingston&#8209;Kanes, jobs that'd eat
anything eatable. Density and radioactivity weren't enough for these motors;
the stuff fed to them had to be right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Going back to the Kingston&#8209;Kanes, he
pulled out the wire, found its end fused into shapelessness. Definitely a failure.
Inserting the second sample, another gray wire not so dull as the first, he
returned to the controls, rammed the energizer. The tail rockets promptly
blasted with a low, moaning note and the thrust dial showed sixty per cent
normal surge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Some people would have got mad at that point.
Steve didn't. His lean, hawklike features quirked, he felt in his pocket for
the third sample, tried that. No soap. The fourth likewise was a flop. The
fifth produced a peculiar and rhythmic series of blasts which shook the vessel
from end to end and caused the thrust&#8209;dial needle to waggle between one
hundred twenty per cent and zero. He visualized the Probe patrols popping
through space like outboard motors while he extracted the stuff and fed the
sixth sample. The sixth roared joyously at one hundred seventy per cent. The
seventh sample was another flop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He discarded all but what was left of the
sixth wire. The stuff was about twelve <span class=GramE>gauge</span> and near
enough for his purpose. It resembled deep-colored copper but was not as soft as
copper nor as heavy. Hard, springy and light, like telephone wire. If there
were at least a thousand yards of it below, and if he could manage to drag it
up to the ship, and if the golden thing didn't come along and ball up the
works, he might be able to blow free. Then he'd get to some place civilized&#8209;&#8209;if
he could find it. The future was based on an appalling selection of
&quot;ifs.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The easiest and most obvious way to salvage
the needed treasure was to blow a hole in the roof, lower a cable through it,
and wind up the wire with the aid of the ship's tiny winch. Problem: how to
blow a hole without suitable explosives. Answer: drill the roof, insert
unshelled pistol ammunition, say a prayer and pop the stuff off electrically.
He tried it, using a hand drill. The bit promptly curled up as if gnawing on a
diamond. He drew his gun, bounced a shell off the roof; the missile exploded
with a sharp, hard crack and fragments of shell casing whined shrilly into the
sky. Where it had struck, the roof bore a blast smudge and a couple of fine
scratches.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>There was nothing for it but to go down and
heave on his shoulders as much loot as he could carry. And do it right away.
Darkness would fall before long, and he didn't want to encounter that golden
thing in the dark. It was fateful enough in broad light of day, or in the
queer, green glow of the building's interior, but to have it stealing softly
behind him as he struggled through the nighttime with his plunder was something
of which he didn't care to think.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Locking the ship and leaving Laura inside, he
returned to the building, made his way past the mile of cases and cabinets to
the machine section at back. He stopped to study nothing on his way. He didn't
wish to study anything. The wire was the thing, only the wire. Besides, mundane
thoughts of mundane wire didn't twist one's mind around until one found it hard
to concentrate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Nevertheless, his mind was afire as he
searched. Half of it was prickly with alertness, apprehensive of the golden
column's sudden return; the other half burned with excitement at the
possibility of release. Outwardly, his manner showed nothing of this; it was
calm, assured, methodical.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Within ten minutes he'd found a great coil of
the coppery metal, a huge ovoid, intricately wound, lying beside a disassembled
machine. He tried to move it, could not shift it an inch. The thing was far too
big, too heavy for one to handle. To get it onto the roof he'd have to cut it
up and make four trips of it&#8209;&#8209;and some of its inner windings were
fused together. So near, so far! Freedom depended upon his ability to move a
lump of metal a thousand feet vertically. He muttered some of Laura's words to
himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Although the wire cutters were ready in his
hand, he paused to think, decided to look farther before tackling this job. It
was a wise decision which brought its reward, for at a point a mere hundred
yards away he came across another, differently shaped coil, wheel&#8209;shaped,
in good condition, easy to unreel. This again was too heavy to carry, but with
a tremendous effort which made his muscles crack he got it up on its rim and
proceeded to roll it along like a monster tire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Several times he had to stop and let the coil
lean against the nearest case while he rested a moment. The last such case
trembled under the impact of the weighty coil and its shining, spidery occupant
stirred in momentary simulation of life. His dislike of the spider shot up with
its motion, he made his rest brief, bowled the coil onward.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Violet streaks again were creeping from the
horizon when he rolled his loot out of the mighty exit and reached the bottom
of the bank. Here, he stopped, clipped the wire with his cutters, took the free
end, climbed the bank with it. The wire uncoiled without hindrance until he
reached the ship, where he attached it to the winch, wound the loot in, rewound
it on the feed spool.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Night fell in one ominous swoop. His hands
were trembling slightly but his hawklike face was firm, phlegmatic as he
carefully threaded the wire's end through the automatic injector and into the
feed hole of the Kingston&#8209;Kanes. That done, he slid open Laura's door,
gave her some of the fruit they'd picked off the Oron tree. She accepted it
morbidly, her manner still subdued, and not inclined for speech.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;Stay inside, Honey,&quot; he soothed.
&quot;We're getting out of this and going home.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Shutting her in, he climbed into the control
seat, switched on the nose beam, saw it pierce the darkness and light up the
facing cliff. Then he stamped on the energizer, warmed the tubes. Their bellow
was violent and comforting. At seventy per cent better thrust he'd have to be a
lot more careful in all his adjustments: it wouldn't do to melt his own tail
off when success was within his grasp. All the same, he felt strangely
impatient, as if every minute counted, aye, every second!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>But he contained himself, got the venturis
heated, gave a discreet puff on his starboard steering flare, watched the cliff
glide sidewise past as the ship slewed around on its belly. Another puff, then
another, and he had the vessel nose&#8209;on to the front edge of the roof.
There seemed to be a faint aura in the gloom ahead and he switched off his nose
beam to study it better.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>It was a faint yellow haze shining over the
rim of the opposite slope.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>His back hairs quivered
as he saw it. The haze strengthened, rose higher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>His eyes
strained into the outer pall as he watched it fascinatedly, and his hands were
frozen on the controls. There was dampness on his back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Behind him, in
her traveling compartment, Laura was completely silent,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>not even
shuffling uneasily as was her wont. He wondered if she were</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>cowering.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&#8209;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>[</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>With a mighty effort of will which strained
him as never before, he</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>shifted his
control a couple of notches, lengthened the tail blast. Trembling in its entire
fabric, the ship edged forward. Summoning all he'd got,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Steve forced
his reluctant hands to administer the take&#8209;off boost. With a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>tearing crash
that thundered back from the cliffs, the little vessel leaped</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>skyward on an
arc of fire. Peering through the transpex, Steve caught a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>fragmentary and
foreshortened glimpse of the great golden column advancing majestically over
the crest, the next instant it had dropped far</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>behind his tail
and his bow was arrowing for the stars.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>An immense relief flooded through his soul
though he knew not what</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>there had been
to fear. But the relief was there and so great was it that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>he worried not
at all about where he was bound or for how long. Some&#8209;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>how, he felt
certain that if he swept in a wide, shallow curve he'd pick</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>up a Probe beat&#8209;note
sooner or later. Once he got a beat&#8209;note, from any</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>source at all,
it would lead him out of the celestial maze.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Luck remained with him, and his optimistic
hunch proved correct, for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>while still
among completely strange constellations he caught the faint</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>throb of Hydra
III on his twenty&#8209;seventh day of sweep. That throb was</p>

bulletin board, touched his long chin, and determined to shave, in spite of the
fact that the show would be video, and he would see it in his barracks. He had
an hour and a half. It felt good to have a purpose againeven the small matter
of shaving before eight o'clock. Eight o'clock Tuesday, just the way it used to
be. Everyone used to say, Wednesday morning, &quot;How about the way Starr sang
The Breeze and I last night?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

dead, before the country was dead. Starr Anthim an institution, like Crosby,
like Duse, like Jenny Lind, like the Statue of Liberty. (Liberty had been one

even now being carried about in vagrant winds, spreading over the earth ... )</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

poisonous fragments of a blasted liberty. Hate was first. Hate was ubiquitous,
like the increasing blue glow in the air at night, like the tension that hung
over the base.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Gunfire cracked sporadically far to the right, swept nearer. Pete
stepped out to the street and made for a parked truck. There was a Wac sitting
on the short running-board.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>At the corner a stocky figure backed into the intersection. The man
carried a tommy-gun in his arms, and he was swinging to and fro with the
gentle, wavering motion of a weathervane. He staggered toward them, his
gun-muzzle hunting. Someone fired from a building and the man swiveled and
blasted wildly at the sound.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;You know what happened. Some kid got tired of hav­ing nothing to

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;I don't mean that.&quot; At last she

himself. She didn't know. She'd forgotten. There was nowhere to escape to, and
she'd escaped inside herself, right here. Why tell her about it? Why tell her
that everyone was going to die? Why tell her that other, shameful thing: that
we hadn't struck back?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

not quite straight. One held his, but the other was slightly shifted and seemed
to be looking at his temple. She was smiling again. When his voice trailed off
she didn't prompt him. Slowly, he moved away. She did not turn her head, but
kept looking up at where he had been, smiling a lit­tle. He turned away,
wanting to run, walking fast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

He'd followed that one through before. It always led to the conclusion that it
would be better to be one of the first. He wasn't ready for that yet. Then he
blanked that out, too. Every time he said to himself that he wasn't ready for
that yet, something within him asked &quot;Why not?&quot; and he never seemed
to have an answer ready.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He climbed the steps of the QM 'Central and went inside. There was
nobody at the reception switchboard. It didn't matter. Messages were carried by
jeep, or on motorcycles. The Base Command was not insisting that anybody stick
to a sitting job these days. Ten desk-men could crack up for every one on a
jeep, or on the soul-sweat squads. Pete made up his mind to put in a little
stretch on a squad tomorrow. Do him good. He just hoped that this time the
adjutant wouldn't burst into tears in the middle of the parade ground. You
could keep your mind on the manual of arms just fine until something like that
happened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He bumped into Sonny Weisefreund in the barracks cor­ridor. The Tech's
round young face was as cheerful as ever. He was naked and glowing, and had a
towel thrown over his shoulder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Hi, Sonny. Is there plenty of hot water?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Why not?&quot; grinned Sonny. Pete grinned back, wondering if
anybody could say anything about anything at all without one of these
reminders. Of course, there was hot water. The QM barracks had hot water for
three hundred men. There were three dozen left. Men dead, men gone to the
hills, men locked up so they wouldn't</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He went into the washroom, smiling and glad that he still could. He
undressed and put his neatly folded clothes down on a bench. There were a
soap-wrapper and an empty tooth-paste tube lying near the wall. He picked them
up and put them in the catchall, took the mop that leaned against the partition
and mopped the floor where Sonny had splashed after shaving. Someone had to
keep things straight. He might have worried if it were anyone else but Sonny.
But Sonny wasn't cracking up. Sonny always had been like that. Look there. Left
his razor out again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Pete started his shower, meticulously adjusting the valves until the
pressure and temperature exactly suited him. He did nothing carelessly these
days. There was so much to feel, and taste, and see now. The impact of water on
his skin, the smell of soap, the consciousness of light and heat, the very
pressure of standing on the soles of his feet. He wondered vaguely how the slow
increase of radioactivity in the air, as the nitrogen transmuted to Carbon
Fourteen, would affect him if he kept carefully healthy in every way. What
happens first? Blindness? Headaches? Perhaps a loss of appetite or slow
fatigue?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Why not look it up?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>On the other hand, why bother? Only a very small per­centage of the men
would die of radioactive poisoning. There were too many other things that
killed more quickly, which was probably just as well. That razor, for example.
It lay gleaming in a sunbeam, curved and clean in the yellow light. Sonny's
father and grandfather had used it, or so he said, and it was his pride and
joy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Pete turned his back on it, and soaped under his arms, concentrating on
the tiny kisses of bursting bubbles. In the midst of a recurrence of disgust at
himself for thinking so often of death, a staggering truth struck him. He did
not think of such things because he was morbid, after all! It was the very
familiarity of things that brought death-thoughts. It was either &quot;I shall
never do this again&quot; or &quot;This is one of the last times I shall do
this.&quot; You might devote yourself com­pletely to doing things in different
ways, he thought madly. You might crawl across the floor this time, and next
time walk across on your hands. You might skip dinner tonight, and have a snack
at two in the morning instead, and eat grass for breakfast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>But you had to breathe. Your heart had to beat. You'd sweat and you'd
shiver, the same as always. You couldn't get away from that. When those things
happened, they would remind you. Your heart wouldn't beat out its wunklunk,
wunk­lunk any more. It would go one-less, one-less, until it yelled and
yammered in your ears and you had to make it stop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Terrific polish on that razor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>And your breath would go on, same as before. You could sidle through
this door, back through the next one and the one after, and figure out a
totally new way to go through the one after that, but your breath would keep on
sliding in and out of your nostrils like a razor going through whiskers, making
a sound like a razor being stropped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Sonny came in. Pete soaped his hair. Sonny picked up the razor and stood
looking at it. Pete watched him, soap ran into his eyes, he swore, and Sonny
jumped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;What are you looking at, Sonny? Didn't you ever see it
before?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Oh, sure. Sure. I just was&quot; He shut the razor, opened it,
flashed light from its blade, shut it again. &quot;I'm tired of using this,
Pete. I'm going to get rid of it. Want it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Want it? In his foot-locker, maybe. Under his pillow. &quot;Thanks, no,
Sonny. Couldn't use it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;I like safety razors,&quot; Sonny mumbled. &quot;Electrics, even
better. What are you going to do with it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Throw it in theno.&quot; Pete pictured the razor turning end over
end in the air, half open, gleaming in the maw of the catchall. &quot;Throw it
out the&quot; No. Curving out into the long grass. He might want it. He might
crawl around in the moonlight looking for it. He might find it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;I guess maybe I'll break it up.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;No,&quot; Pete said. &quot;The pieces&quot; Sharp little pieces.
Hol­low-ground fragments. &quot;I'll think of something. Wait'll I get
dressed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He washed briskly, toweled, while Sonny stood looking at the razor. It
was a blade now, and if it were broken it would be shards and glittering
splinters, still razor sharp. If it were ground dull with an emery wheel, somebody
could find it and put another edge on it because it was so obviously a razor, a
fine steel razor, one that would slice so</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;I know. The laboratory. We'll get rid of it,&quot; Pete said
confidently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He stepped into his clothes, and together they went to the laboratory
wing. It was very quiet there. Their voices echoed. &quot;One of the
ovens,&quot; said Pete, reaching for the razor. &quot;Bake-ovens? You're
crazy!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Pete chuckled. &quot;You don't know this place, do you? Like everything
else on the base, there was a lot more went on here than most people knew
about. They kept calling it the bakeshop. Well, it was research headquarters
for new high-nutrient flours. But there's lots else here. We tested utensils
and designed vegetable-peelers and all sorts of things like that. There's an
electric furnace in there that&quot; He pushed open a door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>They crossed a long, quiet, cluttered room to the thermal equipment. We
can do everything here from annealing glass, through glazing ceramics, to
finding the melting point of frying pans.&quot; He clicked a switch
tentatively. A pilot light glowed. He swung open a small, heavy door and set
the razor inside. &quot;Kiss it goodbye. In twenty minutes it'll be a
puddle.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;I want to see that,&quot; said Sonny. &quot;Can I look around
until it's cooked?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>They walked through the laboratories. Beautifully equipped they were,
and too quiet. Once they passed a major who was bent over a complex electronic
hook-up on one of the benches. He was watching a little amber light flicker,
and he did not return their salute. They tip-toed past him, feeling awed at his
absorption, envying it. They saw the models of the automatic kneaders, the
vitaminizers, the remote signal thermostats and timers and controls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;What's in there?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;I dunno. I'm over the edge of my territory. I don't think there's
anybody left for this section. They were mostly me­chanical and electronic
theoreticians. Hey!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Sonny followed the pointing hand. &quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;That wall-section. It's loose, orwell, what do you know!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He pushed at the section of wall which was very slightly out of line.
There was a dark space beyond.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;What's in there?'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Nothing, or some semi-private hush-hush job. These guys used to
get away with murder,&quot; Sonny said, with an uncharacteristic flash of
irony, &quot;Isn't that the Army theoretician's business?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Cautiously they peered in, then entered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Whheyl The door!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>It swung swiftly and quietly shut. The soft click of the latch was
accompanied by a blaze of light.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>The room was small and windowless. It contained ma­chinerya
&quot;trickle&quot; charger, a bank of storage batteries, an electric-powered
dynamo, two small self-starting gas-driven light plants and a diesel complete
with sealed compressed-air starting cylinders. In the corner was a relay rack
with its panel-bolts spot-welded. Protruding from it was a red-topped lever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>They looked at the equipment wordlessly for a time and then Sonny said,
&quot;Somebody wanted to make awful sure he had power for something.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Now, I wonder what&quot; Pete walked over to the relay rack. He
looked at the lever without touching it. It was wired up; behind the handle, on
the wire, was a folded tag. He opened it cautiously. &quot;To be used only on
specific orders of the Commanding Officer.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Give it a yank and see what happens.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Something clicked behind them. They whirled. &quot;What was that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Seemed to come from that rig beside the door.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>They approached it cautiously. There was a spring-loaded solenoid
attached to a bar which was hinged to drop across the inside of the secret
door, where it would fit into steel gudgeons on the panel. It clicked again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;A Geiger counter,&quot; said Pete disgustedly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Now why,&quot; mused Sonny, &quot;would they design a door to stay
locked unless the general radioactivity went beyond a certain point? That's
what it is. See the relays? And the over-load switch there? And this?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;It has a manual lock, too,&quot; Pete pointed out. The count­er
clicked again. &quot;Let's get out of here: I got one of those things built
into my head these days.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>The door opened easily. They went out, closing it behind them. The
keyhole was cleverly concealed in the crack be­tween two boards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>They were silent as they made their way back to the QM labs. The small
thrill of violation was gone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Back at the furnace, Pete glanced at the temperature dial, then kicked
the latch control. The pilot winked out, and then the door swung open. They
blinked and started back from the raging heat within. They bent and peered. The
razor was gone. A pool of brilliance lay on the floor of the compartment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Ain't much left. Most of it oxidized away,&quot; Pete grunted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>They stood together for a time with their faces lit by the small
shimmering ruin. Later, as they walked back to the barracks, Sonny broke his
long silence with a sigh. &quot;I'm glad we did that, Pete. I'm awful glad we
did that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>At a quarter to eight they were waiting before the combina­tion console
in the barracks. All hands except Pete and Sonny and a wiry-haired, thick-set
corporal named Bonze had, elected to see the show on the big screen in the
mess-hall. The reception was better there of course, but, as Bonze put it.
&quot;You don't get close enough in a big place like that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;I hope she's the same,&quot; said Sonny, half to himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Why should she be? thought Pete morosely as he turned on the set and
watched the screen begin to glow. There were many more of the golden speckles
that had killed reception for the past two weeks . . . Why should anything be
the same, ever again?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He fought a sudden temptation to kick the set to pieces. It, and Starr
Anthim, were part of something that was dead. The country was dead, a once real
countryprosperous, sprawling, laughing, grabbing, growing, and changing, most­ly
healthy, leprous in spots with poverty and injustice, but systemically healthy
enough to overcome any ill. He won­dered how the murderers would like it. They
were welcome to it, now. Nowhere to go. No one to fight. That was true for
every soul on earth now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;You hope she's the same,&quot; he muttered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;The show, I mean,&quot; said Sonny mildly. &quot;I'd like to just
sit here and have it likelike&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Oh, thought Pete mistily. Ohthat. Somewhere to go, that's what it is,
for a few minutes ... &quot;I know,&quot; he said, all the harshness gone from
his voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Noise receded from the audio as the carrier swept in. The light on the
screen swirled and steadied into a diamond pattern. Pete adjusted the focus,
chromic balance and intens­ity. &quot;Turn out the lights, Bonze. I don't want
to see anything but Starr Anthim.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>It was the same, at first. Starr Anthim had never used the usual
fanfares, fade-ins, color and clamor of her contempo­raries. A black screen,
then click! a blaze of gold. It was all there, in focus; tremendously intense,
it did not change. Rather, the eye changed to take it in. She never moved for
sec­onds after she came on; she was there, a portrait, a still face and a white
throat. Her eyes were open and sleeping. Her face was alive and still.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Then, in the eyes which seemed green but were blue flecked with gold, an
awareness seemed to gather, and they came awake. Only then was it noticeable
that her lips were parted. Something in the eyes made the lips be seen, though
nothing moved yet. Not until she bent her bead slowly, so that some of the gold
flecks seemed captured in the golden brows. The eyes were not, then, looking
out at an audience. They were looking at me, and at me, and at ME.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Helloyou,&quot; she said. She was a dream, with a kid sister's
slightly irregular teeth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Bonze shuddered. The cot on which he lay began to squeak rapidly. Sonny
shifted in annoyance. Pete reached out in the dark and caught the leg of the
cot. The squeaking subsided.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;May I sing a song?&quot; Starr asked. There was music, very faint.
&quot;It's an old one, and one of the best. It's an easy song, a deep song, one
that comes from the part of men and women that is mankindthe part that has in
it no greed, no hate, no fear. This song is about joyousness and strength.
It'smy favorite. Is it yours?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>The music swelled. Pete recognized the first two notes of the
introduction and swore quietly. This was wrong. This song was not forthis song
was part of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Sonny sat raptly. Bonze lay still.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Starr Anthim began to sing. Her voice was deep and power­ful, but soft,
with the merest touch of vibrato at the, ends of the phrases. The song flowed
from her, without noticeable effort, seeming to come from her face, her long
hair, her wide-set eyes. Her voice, like her face, was shadowed and clean,
round, blue and green but mostly gold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>The music spiraled, caroled, slid into a somber cry of muted hungry
sixths and ninths; rose, blared, and cut, leav­ing her voice full and alone:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>The last note left a face perfectly composed again, and there was no
movement in it; it was sleeping and vital while the music curved off and away
to the places where music rests when it is not heard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Starr smiled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;It's so easy,&quot; she said. &quot;So simple. All that is fresh
and clean and strong about mankind is in that song, and I think that's all that
need concern us about mankind.&quot; She leaned forward. &quot;Don't you
see?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>The smiled faded and was replaced with a gentle wonder. A tiny furrow
appeared between her brows; she drew back quickly. &quot;I can't seem to talk
to you tonight,&quot; she said, her voice small. &quot;You hate
something.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Hate was shaped like a monstrous mushroom. Hate was the random speckling
of a video plate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;What has happened to us,&quot; said Starr abruptly, imper­sonally,
&quot;is simple too. It doesn't matter who did it--do you understand that? It
doesn't matter. We were attacked. We were struck from the east and from the
west. Most of the bombs were atomicthere were blast-bombs and there were
dust-bombs. We were hit by about five hundred and thirty bombs altogether, and
it has killed us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>She waited.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Sonny's fist smacked into his palm. Bonze lay with his eyes open, quiet.
Pete's jaws hurt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;We have more bombs than both of them put together. We have them.
We are not going to use them. Wait!&quot; She raised her hands suddenly, as if
she could see into each man's face. They sank back, tense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;So saturated is the atmosphere with Carbon Fourteen that all of us
in this hemisphere are going to die. Don't be afraid to say it. Don't be afraid
to think it. It is a truth, and it must be faced. As the transmutation effect
spreads from the ruins of our cities, the air will become increasingly
radioactive, and then we must die. In months, in a year or so, the effect will
be strong overseas. Most of the people there will die too. None will escape
completely. A worse thing will come to them than anything they have given us,
because there will be a wave of horror and madness which is impossible to us.
We are merely going to die. They will live and burn and sicken, and the
children that will be born to them&quot; She shook her head, and her lower lip
grew full. She visibly pulled herself together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Five hundred and thirty bombs . . . I don't think either of our
attackers knew just how strong the other was. There has been so much
secrecy.&quot; Her voice was sad. She shrugged slightly. &quot;They have killed
us, and they have ruined themselves. As for uswe' are not blameless, either.
Neither are we helpless to do anything yet. But what we must do is hard. We
must diewithout striking back.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>She gazed briefly at each man in turn, from the screen. &quot;We must
not strike back. Mankind is about to go through a hell of his own making. We
can be vengefulor merciful, if you likeand let go with the hundreds of bombs
we have. That would sterilize the planet so that not a microbe, not a blade of
grass could escape, and nothing new could grow. We would reduce the earth to a
bald thing, dead and deadly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Noit just won't do. We can't do it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Remember the song? That is humanity. That's in all hu­mans. A
disease made other humans our enemies for a time, but as the generations march
past, enemies become friends and friends enemies. The enmity of those who have
killed us is such a tiny, temporary thing in the long sweep of his­tory!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Her voice deepened. &quot;Let us die with the knowledge that we have
done the one noble thing left to us. The spark of humanity can still live and
grow on this planet. It will be blown and drenched, shaken and all but
extinguished, but it will live if that song is a true one. It will live if we
are human enough to discount the fact that the spark is in the custody of our
temporary enemy. Somea fewof his chil­dren will live to merge with the new
humanity that will gradually emerge from the jungles and the wilderness. Per­haps
there will be ten thousand years of beastliness; perhaps man will be able to
rebuild while he still has his ruins.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>She raised her head, her voice tolling. &quot;And even if this is the
end of humankind, we dare not take away the chances some other life-form might
have to succeed where we failed. If we retaliate, there will not be a dog, a
deer, an ape, a bird or fish or lizard to carry the evolutionary torch. In the
name of justice, if we must condemn and destroy ourselves, let us not condemn
all other life along with us! Mankind is heavy enough with sins. If we must
destroy, let us stop with destroying ourselves!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>There was a shimmering flicker of music. It seemed to stir her hair like
a breath of wind. She smiled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;That's all,&quot; she whispered. And to each man listening she
said, &quot;Good night ... &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>The screen went black. As the carrier cut off (there was no
announcement) the ubiquitous speckles began to swarm across it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Pete rose and switched on the lights. Bonze and Sonny were quite still.
It must have been minutes later when Sonny sat up straight, shaking himself
like a puppy. Something besides the silence seemed to tear with the movement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He said, softly, &quot;You're not allowed to fight anything, or to run
away, or to live, and now you can't even hate any more, because Starr says
no.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>There was bitterness in the sound of it, and a bitter smell to the air.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Pete Mawser sniffed once, which had nothing to do with the smell. He
sniffed again. &quot;What's that smell, Son?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Sonny tested it. &quot;I don't Something familiar. Vanillano . . .
No.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Almonds. Bitter Bonze!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Bonze lay still with his eyes open, grinning. His jaw mus­cles were
knotted, and they could see almost all his teeth. He was soaking wet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Bonze!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;It was just when she came on and said 'Helloyou remember?&quot;
whispered Pete. &quot;Oh, the poor kid. That's why he wanted to catch the show
here instead of in the mess-hall.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Went out looking at her,&quot; said Sonny through pale lips.
&quot;Ican't say I blame him much. Wonder where he got the stuff.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Never mind that!&quot; Pete's voice was harsh. &quot;Let's get out
of here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>They left to call the ambulance. Bonze lay watching the console with his
dead eyes and his smell of bitter almonds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Pete did not realize where he was going, or exactly why, until he found
himself on the dark street near GHQ and the communications shack, reflecting
that it might be nice to be able to hear Starr, and see her, whenever he felt
like it. Maybe there weren't any recordings; yet her musical background was
recorded, and the signal corps might have recorded the show.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He stood uncertainly outside the GHQ building. There was a cluster of
men outside the main entrance. Pete smiled briefly. Rain, nor snow, nor sleet,
nor gloom of night could stay the stage-door Johnnie.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He went down the side street and up the delivery ramp in the back. Two
doors along the platform was the rear exit of the Communications section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>There was a light on in the communications shack. He had his hand out to
the screen door when he noticed someone standing in the shadows beside it. The
light played daintily on the golden margins of a head and face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He stopped. &quot;SStarr Anthim!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Hello, soldier. Sergeant.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He blushed like an adolescent. &quot;I&quot; His voice left him. He
swallowed, reached up to whip off his hat. He had no hat. &quot;I saw the
show,&quot; he said. He felt clumsy. It was dark, and yet he was very conscious
of the fact that his dress-shoes were indifferently shined.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>She moved toward him into the light, and she was so beau­tiful that he
had to close his eyes. &quot;What's your name?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Mawser. Pete Mawser.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Like the show?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Not looking at her, he said stubbornly, &quot;No.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Oh?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;I meanI liked it some. The song.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Ithink I see.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;I wondered if I could maybe get a recording.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;I think so,&quot; she said. &quot;What kind of reproducer have you
got?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Audiovid.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;A disc. Yes; we dubbed off a few. Wait, I'll get you one.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>She went inside, moving slowly. Pete watched her, spellbound. She was a
silhouette, crowned and haloed; and then she was a framed picture, vivid and
golden. He waited, watch­ing the light hungrily. She returned with a large
envelope, called good night to someone inside, and came out on the platform.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Here you are, Pete Mawser.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Thanks very&quot; he mumbled. He went his lips. &quot;It was very
good of you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Not really. The more it circulates, the better.&quot; She laughed
suddenly. &quot;That isn't meant quite as it sounds. I'm not exact­ly looking
for new publicity these days.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>The stubbornness came back. &quot;I don't know that you'd get it, if you
put on that show in normal times.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Her eyebrows went up. &quot;Well!&quot; she smiled. &quot;I seem to have
made quite an impression.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>I'm sorry,&quot; he said warmly. &quot;I shouldn't have taken that
tack. Everything I think and say these days is exaggerated.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;I know what you mean.&quot; She looked around. &quot;How is it
here?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;It's okay. I used to be bothered by the secrecy, and being buried
miles away from civilization.&quot; He chuckled bitterly. &quot;Turned out to
be lucky after all.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;You sound like the first chapter of One World or None.&quot; He
looked up quickly. &quot;What do you use for a reading list the Government's
own Index Expurgatorius?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>She laughed. &quot;Come now, it isn't as bad as all that. The book was
never banned. It was just&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Unfashionable,&quot; he filled in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Yes, more's the pity. If people had paid more attention to it in
the 'forties, perhaps this wouldn't have happened.&quot; He followed her gaze
to the dimly pulsating sky. &quot;How long are you going to be here?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Untilas long asI'm not leaving.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;You're not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;I'm finished,&quot; she said simply. &quot;I've covered all the
ground I can. I've been everywhere that ... anyone knows about.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;With this show?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>She nodded. &quot;With this particular message.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He was quiet, thinking. She turned to the door, and he put out his hand,
not touching her. &quot;Please&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;I'd like toI mean, if you don't mind, I don't often have a chance
to talk tomaybe you'd like to walk around a little before you turn in.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Thanks, no, Sergeant. I'm tired.&quot; She did sound tired.
&quot;I'll see you around.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He stared at her, a sudden fierce light in his brain. &quot;I know where
it is. It's got a red-topped lever and a tag re­ferring to orders of the
commanding officer. It's really cam­ouflaged.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>She was quiet so long that he thought she had not heard him. Then,
&quot;I'll take that walk.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>They went down the ramp together and turned toward the dark parade
ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;How did you know?&quot; she asked quietly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Not too tough. This `message' of yours; the fact that you've been
all over the country with it; most of all, the fact that somebody finds it
necessary to persuade us not to strike back. Who are you working for?&quot; he
asked bluntly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Surprisingly, she laughed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;What's that for?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;A moment ago you were blushing and shuffling your feet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>His voice was rough. &quot;I wasn't talking to a human being. I was talking
to a thousand songs I've heard, and a hundred thousand blonde pictures I've
seen pinned up. You'd better tell me what this is all about.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>She stopped. &quot;Let's go up and see the colonel.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He took her elbow. &quot;No. I'm just a sergeant, and he's high brass,
and that doesn't make any difference at all now. You're a human being, and so
am I, and I'm supposed to respect your rights as such. I don't. You'd better
tell me about it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;All right,&quot; she said, with a tired acquiescence that fright­ened
something inside him. &quot;You seem to have guessed right, though. It's true.
There are master firing keys for the launch­ing sites. We have located and
dismantled all but two. It's very likely that one of the two was vaporized. The
other one islost.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Lost?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;I don't have to tell you about the secrecy,&quot; she said.
&quot;You know how it developed between nation and nation. You must know that
it existed between State and Union, between de­partment and department, office
and office. There were only three or four men who knew where all the keys were.
Three of them were in the Pentagon when it went up. That was the third
blast-bomb, you know. If there was another, it could only have been Senator
Vanercook, and he died three weeks ago without talking.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;An automatic radio key, hm?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;That's right. Sergeant, must we walk? I'm so tired.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; he said impulsively. They crossed to the
reviewing stand and sat on the lonely benches. &quot;Launching racks all over,
all hidden, and all armed?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Most of them are armed. There's a timing mechanism in them that
will disarm them in a year or so. But in the meantime, they are armedand
aimed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Aimed where?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;It doesn't matter.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;I think I see. What's the optimum number again?&quot; &quot;About
six hundred and forty; a &quot;few more or less. At least five hundred and
thirty have been thrown so far. We don't know exactly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Who are we?&quot; he asked furiously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Who? Who?&quot; She laughed weakly. &quot;I could say, 'The
Government,' perhaps. If the President dies, the Vice-Presi­dent takes over,
and then the Secretary of State, and so on and on. How far can you go? Pete
Mawser, don't you realize yet what's happened?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;I don't know what you mean.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;How many people do you think are left in this country?&quot;
&quot;I don't know. Just a few million, I guess.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;How many are here?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;About nine hundred.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Then, as far as I know, this is the largest city left.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He leaped to his feet. &quot;No!&quot; The syllable roared away from
him, hurled itself against the dark, empty buildings, came back to him in a
series of lower-case echoes: nononono. . .no-no.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Starr began to speak rapidly, quietly. &quot;They're scattered all over
the fields and the roads. They sit in the sun and die. They run in packs, they
tear at each other. They pray and starve and kill themselves and die in the
fires. The fireseverywhere, if anything stands, it's burning. Summer, and the
leaves all down in the Berkshires, and the blue grass burnt brown; you can see
the grass dying from the air, the death going out wider and wider from the
bald-spots. Thunder and roses. . . . I saw roses, new ones, creeping from the
smashed pots of a greenhouse. Brown petals, alive and sick, and the thorns
turned back on themselves, growing into the stems, killing. Feldman died
tonight.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He let her be quiet for a time. Then:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Who is Feldman?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;My pilot.&quot; She was talking hollowly into her hands.
&quot;He's been dying for weeks. He's been on his nerve-ends. I don't think he
had any blood left. He buzzed your GHQ and made for the landing strip. He came
in with the motor dead, free rotors, giro. Smashed the landing gear. He was
dead, too. He killed a man in Chicago so he could steal gas. The man didn't
want the gas. There was a dead girl by the pump. He didn't want us to go near.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm going to stay here. I'm tired.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>At last she cried.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Pete left her alone, and walked out to the center of the parade ground,
looking back at the faint huddled glimmer on the bleachers. His mind flickered
over the show that eve­ning, and the way she had sung before the merciless
trans­mitter. &quot;Hello, you.&quot; &quot;If we must destroy, let us stop
with destroying ourselves!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>The dimming spark of humankind . . . what could it mean to her? How

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

in the contaminated air.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He looked down through the darkness for his hands. No planet, no
universe, is greater to a man than his own ego, his own observing self. These
hands were the hands of all his­tory, and like the hands of all men, they could
by their small acts make human history or end it. Whether this power of hands
was that of a billion hands, or whether it came to a focus in these twothis
was suddenly unimportant to the eternities which now enfolded him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>She sat straight. She rose, and came to him, smiling. He could see her
smile, because, very faintly in this air, her teeth fluoresced. She put her
hands on his shoulders. &quot;Pete.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He held her very close for a moment. Her knees buckled then, and he had
to carry her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>There was no one in the Officers' Club, which was the nearest building.
He stumbled in, moved clawing along the wall until he found a switch. The light
hurt him. He carried her to a settee and put her down gently. She did not move.
One side of her face was as pale as milk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He stood looking stupidly at it, wiped it on the sides of his trousers,
looking dully at Starr. There was blood on her shirt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>A doctor . . . but there was no doctor. Not since Anders had hanged
himself. &quot;Get somebody,&quot; he muttered. &quot;Do something.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He dropped to his knees and gently unbuttoned her shirt. Between the
sturdy, unfeminine GI bra and the top of her slacks, there was blood on her
side. He whipped out a clean handkerchief and began to wipe it away. There was
no wound, no puncture. But abruptly there was blood again. He blotted it
carefully. And again there was blood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>It was like trying to dry a piece of ice with a towel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He ran to the water cooler, wrung out the bloody handker­chief and ran
back to her. He bathed her face carefully, the pale right side, the flushed
left side. The handkerchief red­dened again, this time with cosmetics, and then
her face was pale all over, with great blue shadows under the eyes. While he
watched, blood appeared on her left cheek.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;There must be somebody&quot; He fled to the door.
&quot;Pete!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Running, turning at the sound of her voice, he hit the doorpost
stunningly, caromed off, flailed for his balance, and then was back at her
side. &quot;Starr! Hang on, now! I'll get a doctor as quick as&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Her hand strayed over her left cheek. &quot;You found out. Nobody else
knew, but Feldman. It got hard to cover prop­erly.&quot; Her hand went up to her
hair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Why, sure; certainly, Starr.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Don't disturb my hair. It isn'tall mine, you see.&quot; She
sounded like a seven-year-old, playing a game. &quot;It all came out on this
side. I don't want you to see me that way.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He was on his knees beside her again. &quot;What is it? What happened to
you?&quot; he asked hoarsely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Philadelphia,&quot; she murmured. &quot;Right at the beginning.
The mushroom went up a half-mile away. The studio caved in. I came to the next day.
I didn't know I was burned, then. It didn't show. My left side. It doesn't
matter, Pete. It doesn't hurt at all, now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He sprang to his feet again. &quot;I'm going for a doctor.&quot;
&quot;Don't go away. Please don't go away and leave me. Please don't.&quot;
There were tears in her eyes. &quot;Wait just a little while. Not very long,
Pete.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He sank to his knees again. She gathered both his hands in hers and held
them tightly. She smiled happily. &quot;You're good, Pete. You're so
good.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>(She couldn't hear the blood in his ears, the roar of the whirlpool of
hate and fear and anguish that spun inside of him.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>She talked to him in a low voice, and then in whispers. Sometimes he
hated himself because he couldn't quite follow her. She talked about school,
and her first audition. &quot;I was so scared that I got a vibrato in my voice.
I'd never had one before. I always let myself get a little scared when I sing
now. It's easy.&quot; There was something about a window-box when she was four
years old. &quot;Two real live tulips and a pitcher-plant. I used to be sorry
for the flies.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>There was a long period of silence after that, during which his muscles
throbbed with cramp and stiffness, and gradually became numb. He must have
dozed; he awoke with a violent start, feeling her fingers on his face. She was
propped up on one elbow. She said clearly. &quot;I just wanted to tell you, dar­ling.
Let me go first, and get everything ready for you. It's going to be wonderful.
I'll fix you a special tossed salad. I'll make you a steamed chocolate pudding
and keep it hot for you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Too muddled to understand what she was saying, he smiled and pressed her
back on the settee. She took his hands again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>The next time he awoke it was broad daylight, and she was dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Sonny Weisefreund was sitting on his cot when he got back to the barracks.
He handed over the recording he had picked up from the parade ground on the way
back. &quot;Dew on it. Dry it off. Good boy,&quot; he croaked, and fell face
downward on the cot Bonze had used.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Sonny stared at him. &quot;Pete! Where you been? What hap­pened? Are you
all right?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Pete shifted a little and grunted. Sonny shrugged and took the audiovid
disc out of its wet envelope. Moisture would not harm it particularly, though
it could not be played while wet. It was made of a fine spiral of plastic,
insulated between laminations. Electrostatic pickups above and below the
turn-table would fluctuate with changes in the dielectric constant which had
been impressed by the recording, and these changes were amplified for the
scanners. The audio was a conven­tional hill-and-dale needle. Sonny began to
wipe it down carefully.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Pete fought upward out of a vast, green-lit place full of flickering
cold fires. Starr was calling him. Something was punching him, too. He fought
weakly, trying to hear what she was saying. But someone else was jabbering too
loud for him to hear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He opened his eyes. Sonny was shaking him, his round face pink with
excitement. The Audiovid was running. Starr was talking. Sonny got up
impatiently and turned down the volume. &quot;Pete! Pete! Wake up, will you? I
got to tell you something. Listen to me! Wake up, will yuh?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;That's better. Now listen. I've just been listening to Starr
Anthim&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;She's dead,&quot; said Pete.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Sonny didn't hear. He went on, explosively, &quot;I've figured it out.
Starr was sent out here, and all over, to beg someone not to fire any more atom
bombs. If the government was sure they wouldn't strike back, they wouldn't've
taken the trouble. Somewhere, Pete, there's some way to launch bombs at those
murdering cowardsand I've got a pretty shrewd idea of how to do it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Pete strained groggily toward the faint sound of Starr's voice. Sonny
talked on. &quot;Now, s'posing there was a master radio keyan automatic code
device something like the alarm signal they have on ships, that rings a bell on
any ship within radio range when the operator sends four long dashes. Suppose
there's an automatic code machine to launch bombs, with repeaters, maybe,
buried all over the country. What would it be? Just a little lever to pull;
that's all. How would the thing be hidden? In the middle of a lot of other
equip­ment, that's where; in some place where you'd expect to find
crazy-looking secret stuff. Like an experiment station. Like right here. You
beginning to get the idea?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Shut up, I can't hear her.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;The hell with her! You can listen to her some other time. You
didn't hear a thing I said!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;She's dead.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Yeah. Well, I figure I'll pull that handle. What can I lose? It'll
give those murderin'what?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;She's dead.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Dead? Starr Anthim?&quot; His young face twisted, Sonny sank down
to the cot. &quot;You're half asleep. You don't know what you're saying.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;She's dead,&quot; Pete said hoarsely. &quot;She got burned by one
of the first bombs. I was with her when sheshe Shut up now and get out of
here and let me listen!&quot; he bellowed hoarsely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Sonny stood up slowly. &quot;They killed her, too. They killed her! That
does it. That just fixes it up.&quot; His face was white. He went out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Pete got up. His legs weren't working right. He almost fell. He brought
up against the console with a crash, his out-flung arm sending the pickup
skittering across the record. He put it on again and turned up the volume, then
lay down to listen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>His head was all mixed up. Sonny talked too much. Bomb launchers,
automatic code machines</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;You gave me your heart,&quot; sang Starr. &quot;You gave me your
heart. You gave me your heart. You ... &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Pete heaved himself up again and moved the pickup arm. Anger, not at
himself, but at Sonny for causing him to cut the disc that way, welled up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Starr was talking, stupidly, her face going through the same expression
over and over again. &quot;Struck from the east , and from the struck from the
east and from the ...&quot; He got up again wearily and moved the pickup.
&quot;You gave me your heart you gave me ... &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Pete made an agonized sound that was not a word at all, bent, lifted,
and sent the console crashing over. In the bludg­eoning silence he said,
&quot;I did, too.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Then, &quot;Sonny.&quot; He waited.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Sonny!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>His eyes went wide then, and he cursed and bolted for the corridor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>The panel was closed when he reached it. He kicked at it. It flew open,
discovering darkness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Hey!&quot; bellowed Sonny. &quot;Shut it! You turned off the
lights!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Pete shut it behind them. The lights blazed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Pete! What's the matter?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;Nothing's the matter, Son,&quot; croaked Pete.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;What are you looking at?&quot; said Sonny uneasily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; said Pete as gently as he could. &quot;I just
wanted to find something out, is all. Did you tell anyone else about
this?&quot; He pointed to the lever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Why, no. I only just figured it out while you were sleep­ing, just
now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Pete looked around carefully, while Sonny shifted his weight. Pete moved
toward the tool-rack. &quot;Something you haven't noticed yet, Sonny,&quot; he
said softly, and pointed. &quot;Up there, on the wall behind you. High up.
See?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Sonny turned. In one fluid movement Pete plucked off a fourteen-inch box
wrench and hit Sonny with it as hard as he could.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>Afterward he went to work systematically on the power supplies. He
pulled the plugs on the gas-engines and cracked their cylinders with a maul. He
knocked off the tubing of the diesel startersthe tanks let go explosivelyand
he cut all the cables with bolt-cutters. Then he broke up the relay rack and
its lever. When he was quite finished, he put away his tools and bent and
stroked Sonny's tousled hair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>He went out and closed the partition carefully. It cer­tainly was a
wonderful piece of camouflage. He sat down heavily on a workbench nearby.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.25in'>&quot;You'll have your chance,&quot; he said into the far future.
&quot;And, by Heaven, you'd better make good.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

WAS MET AT THE AIPORT BY A STAFF CAR. LONG and fast it sped. In a narrow,
silent room the general sat, ramrod-backed, tense. The major waited at the foot
of the gleaming steps shining frostily in the night air. Tires screamed to a stop
and together the captain and the major raced up the steps. No words of greeting
were spoken. The general stood quickly, hand outstretched. The captain ripped
open a dispatch case and handed over a thick bundle of papers. The general
flipped them over eagerly and spat a sentence at the major. The major
disappeared and his harsh voice rang curtly down the outside hall. The man with
glasses came in and the general handed him the papers. With jerky fingers the
man with glasses sorted them out. With a wave from the general the captain
left, a proud smile on his weary young face. The general tapped his fingertips
on the black glossy surface of the table. The man with glasses pushed aside
crinkled maps, and began to read aloud.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I started
this just to kill time, because I got tired of just looking out the window. But
when I got almost to the end I began to catch the trend of what's going on.
You're the only one I know that can come through for me, and when you finish
this you'll know why you must.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I don't know
who will get this to you. Whoever it is won't want you to identify a face

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>It all
started because I'm lazy. By the time I'd shaken off the sandman and checked
out of the hotel every seat in the bus was full. I stuck my bag in a dime
locker and went out to kill the hour I had until the bus left. You know the bus
terminal: right across from the Book-Cadillac and the Statler, on Washington
Boulevard near Michigan Avenue. Michigan Avenue. Like Main in Los Angeles, or
maybe Sixty-third in its present state of decay in Chicago, where I was going.
Cheap movies, pawnshops and bars by the dozens, a penny arcade or two,
restaurants that feature hamburg steak, bread and butter and coffee for forty
cents. Before the War, a quarter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I like
pawnshops. I like cameras, I like tools, I like to look in windows crammed with
everything from electric razors to sets of socket wrenches to upper plates. So,
with an hour to spare, I walked out Michigan to Sixth and back on the other
side of the street. There are a lot of Chinese and Mexicans around that part of
town, the Chinese running the restaurants and the Mexicans eating Southern Home
Cooking. Between Fourth and Fifth, I stopped to stare at what passed for a
movie. Store windows painted black, amateurish signs extolling in Spanish
&quot;Detroit premiere . . . cast of thousands .. . this week only . . . ten
cents&quot; The few 8x10 glossy stills pasted on the windows were poor
blowups, spotty and wrinkled; pictures of mailed cavalry and what looked like a
good sized battle. All for ten cents. Right down my alley.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Maybe it's
lucky that history was my major in school. Luck it must have been, certainly
not cleverness, that made me pay a dime for a seat in an undertaker's rickety
folding chair im­bedded solidlyalthough the only other customers were a
half-dozen Sons of the Order of Tortillain a cast of second-hand garlic. I sat
near the door. A couple of hundred watt bulbs dangling naked from the ceiling
gave enough light for me to look around. In front of me, in the rear of the
store, was the screen, what looked like a white-painted sheet of beaverboard,
and when over my shoulder I saw the battered sixteen millimeter projector I
began to think that even a dime was no bargain. Still, I had forty minutes to
wait.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Everyone was
smoking. I lit a cigarette and the discouraged Mexican who had taken my dime
locked the door and turned off the lights, after giving me a long, questioning
look. I'd paid my dime, so I looked right back. In a minute the old projector
started clattering. No film credits, no producer's name, no director, just a
tentative flicker before a closeup of a bewhiskered mug labeled Cortez. Then a
painted and feathered Indian with the title of Guatemotzin, successor to
Montezuma; an aerial shot of a beautiful job of model-building tagged Ciudad de
Mejico, 1521. Shots of old muzzle­loaded artillery banging away, great walls
spurting stone splin­ters under direct fire, skinny Indians dying violently
with the customary gyrations, smoke and haze and blood. The photog­raphy sat me
right up straight. It had none of the scratches and erratic cuts that
characterize an old print, none of the fuzziness, none of the usual mugging at
the camera by the handsome hero. There wasn't any handsome hero. Did you ever
see one of these French pictures, or a Russian, and comment on the reality and
depth brought out by working on a small budget that can't afford famed actors?
This, what there was of it, was as good, or better.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>It wasn't
until the picture ended with a pan shot of a dreary desolation that I began to
add two and two. You can't, for pennies, really have a cast of thousands, or
sets big enough to fill Central Park. A mockup, even, of a thirty-foot wall
costs enough to irritate the auditors, and there had been a lot of wall. That
didn't fit with the bad editing and lack of wound track, not unless the picture
had been made in the old silent days. And I knew it hadn't by the color tones
you get with pan film. It looked like a well-rehearsed and badly-planned
newsreel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>The Mexicans
were easing out and I followed them to where the discouraged one was rewinding
the reel. I asked him where he got the print.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I
haven't heard of any epics from the press agents lately, and it looks like a
fairly recent print.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>He agreed
that it was recent, and added that he'd made it himself. I was polite to that,
and he saw that I didn't believe him and straightened up from the projector.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You
don't believe that, do you?&quot; I said that I certainly did, and I had to
catch a bus. &quot;Would you mind telling me why, exactly why?&quot; I said
that the bus &quot;I mean it. I'd appreciate it if you'd tell me just what's
wrong with it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;There's
nothing wrong with it,&quot; I told him. He waited for me to go on. &quot;Well,
for one thing, pictures like that aren't made for the sixteen millimeter trade.
You've got a reduction from a thirty-five millimeter master,&quot; and I gave
him a few of the other reasons that separate home movies from Hollywood. When I
finished he smoked quietly for a minute.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I
see.&quot; He took the reel off the projector spindle and closed the case.
&quot;I have beer in the back.&quot; I agreed beer sounded good, but the
buswell, just one. From in back of the beaver-board screen he brought paper
cups and a Jumbo bottle. With a whimsical &quot;Business suspended&quot; he
closed the open door and opened the bottle with an opener screwed on the wall.
The store had likely been a grocery or restaurant. There were plenty of chairs.
Two we shoved around and relaxed companionably. The beer was warm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You
know something about this line,&quot; tentatively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I took it as
a question and laughed. &quot;Not too much. Here's mud,&quot; and we drank.
&quot;Used to drive a truck for the Film Exchange.&quot; He was amused at that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Stranger
in town?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes and
no. Mostly yes. Sinus trouble chased me out and relatives bring me back. Not
any more, though; my father's funeral was last week.&quot; He said that was too
bad, and I said it wasn't. &quot;He had sinus, too.&quot; That was a joke, and
he refilled the cups. We talked awhile about Detroit climate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Finally he
said, rather speculatively, &quot;Didn't I see you around here last night? Just
about eight.&quot; He got up and went after more beer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I called
after him. &quot;No more beer for me.&quot; He brought a bottle anyway, and I
looked at my watch. &quot;Well, just one.&quot; &quot;Was it you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Was it
me what?&quot; I held out my paper cup. 'Weren't you around here&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I wiped foam
off my mustache. &quot;Last night? No, but I wish I had. I'd have caught my
bus. No, I was in the Motor Bar last night at eight. And I was still there at
midnight.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>He chewed his
lip thoughtfully. &quot;The Motor Bar. Just down the street?&quot; And I
nodded. &quot;The Motor Bar. Hm-m-m.&quot; I looked at him. &quot;Would you
like . . . sure, you would.&quot; Before I could figure out what he was talking
about he went to the back and from behind the beaverboard screen rolled out a
big radio-phonograph and another Jumbo bottle. I held the bottle against the
light. Still half full. I looked at my watch. He rolled the radio against the
wall and lifted the lid to get at the dials.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Reach
behind you, will you? The switch on the wall.&quot; I could reach the switch
without getting up, and I did. The lights went out. I hadn't expected that, and
I groped at arm's length. Then the lights came on again, and I turned back, re­lieved.
But the lights weren't on; I was looking at the street!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Now, all this
happened while I was dripping beer and trying to keep my balance on a tottering
chairthe street moved, I didn't and it was day and it was night and I was in
front of the Book-Cadillac and I was going into the Motor Bar and I was watching
myself order a beer and I knew I was wide awake and not dreaming. In a panic I
scrabbled off the floor, shedding chairs and beer like an umbrella while I
ripped my nails feeling frantically for that light switch. By the time I found
itand all the while I was watching myself pound the bar for the barkeepI was
really in fine fettle, just about ready to collapse. Out of thin air right into
a nightmare. At last I found the switch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>The Mexican
was looking at me with the queerest expres­sion I've ever seen, like he'd
baited a mousetrap and caught a frog. Me? I suppose I looked like I'd seen the
devil himself. Maybe I had. The beer was all over the floor and I barely made
it to the nearest chair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What,&quot;
I managed to get out, &quot;what was that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>The lid of the
radio went down. &quot;I felt like that too, the first time. I'd
forgotten.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>My fingers
were too shaky to get out a cigarette, and I ripped off the top of the package.
&quot;I said, what was that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>He sat down.
&quot;That was you, in the Motor Bar, at eight last night.&quot; I must have
looked blank as he handed me another paper cup. Automatically I held it out to
be refilled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Look
here&quot; I started.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I
suppose it is a shock. I'd forgotten what I felt like the first time I . . . I
don't care much any more. Tomorrow I'm going out to Phillips Radio.&quot; That
made no sense to me, and I said so. He went on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I'm
licked. I'm flat broke. I don't give a care any more. I'll settle for cash and
live off the royalties.&quot; The story came out, slowly at first, then faster
until he was pacing the floor. I guess he was tired of having no one to talk
to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>His name was
Miguel Jose Zapata Laviada. I told him mine; Lefko. Ed Lefko. He was the son of
sugar beet workers who had emigrated from Mexico somewhere in the Twenties.
They were sensible enough not to quibble when their oldest son left the
back-breaking Michigan fields to seize the chance provided by a NYA
scholarship. When the scholarship ran out, he'd worked in garages, driven
trucks, clerked in stores, and sold brushes door-to-door to exist and learn.
The Army cut short his education with the First Draft to make him a radar
technician, the Army had given him an honorable discharge and an idea so
nebulous as to be almost merely a hunch. Jobs were plentiful then, and it
wasn't too hard to end up with enough money to rent a trailer and fill it with
Army surplus radio and radar equipment. One year ago he'd finished what he'd
started, finished underfed, underweight, and overexcited. But successful,
because he had it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It&quot;
he installed in a radio cabinet, both for ease in han­dling and for camouflage.
For reasons that will become ap­parent, he didn't dare apply for a patent. I
looked &quot;it&quot; over pretty carefully. Where the phonograph turntable and
radio controls had been were vernier dials galore. One big one was numbered 1
to 24, a couple were numbered 1 to 60, and there were a dozen or so numbered 1
to 25, plus two or three with no numbers at all. Closest of all it resembled
one of these fancy radio or motor testers found in a super super-service station.
That was all, except that there was a sheet of heavy plywood hiding whatever
was installed in place of the radio chassis and speaker. A perfectly innocent
cache for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Daydreams are
swell. I suppose we've all had our share of mental wealth or fame or travel or
fantasy. But to sit in a chair and drink warm beer and realize that the dream
of ages isn't a dream any more, to feel like a god, to know that just by
turning a few dials you can see and watch anything, anybody, anywhere, that has
ever happenedit still bothers me once in a while.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I know this
much, that it's high frequency stuff. And there's a lot of mercury and copper
and wiring of metals cheap and easy to find, but what goes where, or how, least
of all, why, is out of my line. Light has mass and energy, and that mass always
loses part of itself and can be translated back to elec­tricity, or something.
Mike Laviada himself says that what he stumbled on and developed was nothing
new, that long before the war it had been observed many times by men like
Compton and Michelson and Pfeiffer, who discarded it as a useless laboratory
effect. And, of course, that was before atomic research took precedence over
everything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>When the
first shock wore offand Mike had to give me another demonstrationI must have made
quite a sight. Mike tells me I couldn't sit down. I'd pop up and gallop up and
down the floor of that ancient store kicking chairs out of my way or stumbling
over them, all the time gobbling out words and disconnected sentences faster
than my tongue could trip.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Finally it
filtered through that he was laughing at me. I didn't see where it was any
laughing matter, and I prodded him. He began to get angry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I know
what I have,&quot; he snapped. &quot;I'm not the biggest fool in the world, as
you seem to think. Here, watch this,&quot; and he went back to the radio.
&quot;Turn out the light.&quot; I did, and there I was watching myself at the
Motor Bar again, a lot happier this time. &quot;Watch this.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>The bar
backed away. Out in the street, two blocks down to the City Hall. Up the steps
to the Council Room. No one there. Then Council was in session, then they were
gone again. Not a picture, not a projection of a lantern slide, but a slice of
life about twelve feet square. If we were close, the field of view was narrow.
If we were further away, the background was just as much in focus as the
foreground. The images, if you want to call them images, were just as real,
just as lifelike as looking in the doorway of a room. Real they were,
three-dimensional, stopped by only the back wall or the distance in the
background. Mike was talking as he spun the dials, but I was too engrossed to
pay much attention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I yelped and
grabbed and closed my eyes as you would if you were looking straight down with
nothing between you and the ground except a lot of smoke and a few clouds. I
winked my eyes open almost at the ends of what must have been a long racing
vertical dive, and there I was, looking at the street again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Go any
place up the Heaviside Layer, go down as deep as any hole, anywhere, any
time.&quot; A blur, and the street changed into a glade of sparse pines.
&quot;Buried treasure. Sure. Find it, with what?&quot; The trees disappeared
and I reached back for the light switch as he dropped the lid of the radio and
sat down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;How are
you going to make any money when you haven't got it to start?&quot; No answer
to that from me. &quot;I ran an ad in the paper offering to recover lost
articles; my first cus­tomer was the Law wanting to see my private detective's
license. I've seen every big speculator in the country sit in his office buying
and selling and making plans; what do you think would happen if I tried to
peddle advance market informa­tion? I've watched the stock market get shoved up
and down while I had barely the money to buy the paper that told me about it. I
watched a bunch of Peruvian Indians bury the second ransom of Atuahalpa; I
haven't the fare to get to Peru, or the money to buy the tools to dig.&quot; He
got up and brought two more bottles. He went on. By that time I was getting a
few ideas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I've
watched scribes indite the books that burnt at Alex­andria; who would buy, or
who would believe me, if I copied one? What would happen if I went over to the
Library and told them to rewrite their histories? How many would fight to tie a
rope around my neck if they knew I'd watched them steal and murder and take a
bath? What sort of a padded cell would I get if I showed up with a photograph
of Washington, or Caesar? Or Christ?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I agreed that
it was all probably true, but</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Why do
you think I'm here now? You saw the picture I showed for a dime. A dime's
worth, and that's all, because I didn't have the money to buy film or to make
the picture as I knew I should.&quot; His tongue began to get tangled. He was
excited. &quot;I'm doing this because I haven't the money to get the things I
need to get the money I'll need&quot; He was so disgusted he booted a chair
halfway across the room. It was easy to see that if I had been around a little
later, Phillips Radio would have profited. Maybe I'd have been better off, too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Now, although
always I've been told that I'd never be worth a hoot, no one has ever accused
me of being slow for a dollar. Especially an easy one. I saw money in front of
me, easy money, the easiest and the quickest in the world. I saw, for a minute,
so far in the future with me on top of the heap, that my head reeled and it was
hard to breathe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Mike,&quot;
I said, &quot;let's finish that beer and go where we can get some more, and
maybe something to eat. We've got a lot of talking to do.&quot; So we did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Beer is a mighty
fine lubricant; I have always been a pretty smooth talker, and by the time we
left the gin mill I had a pretty good idea of just what Mike had on his mind.
By the time we'd shacked up for the night behind that beaverboard screen in the
store, we were full-fledged partners. I don't recall our even shaking hands on
the deal, but that partnership still holds good. Mike is ace high with me, and
I guess it's the other way around, too. That was six years ago; it only took me
a year or so to discard some of the corners I used to cut.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Seven days
after that, on a Tuesday, I was riding a bus to Grosse Pointe with a full
briefcase. Two days after that was riding back from Grosse Pointe in a shiny
taxi, with an empty briefcase and a pocketful of folding money. It was easy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Mr.
Jones--or Smith--or BrownI'm with Aristocrat Studios, Personal and Candid
Portraits. We thought you might like this picture of you and . . . no, this is
just a proof. The negative is in our files.... Now, if you're real interested,
I'll be back the day after tomorrow with our file ... I'm sure you will, Mr.
Jones. Thank you, Mr. Jones...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Dirty? Sure.
Blackmail is always dirty. But if I had a wit and family and a good reputation,
I'd stick to the roast and forget the Roquefort. Very smelly Roquefort, at
that. Mike liked it less than I did. It took some talking, and I had to drag
out the old one about the ends justifying the means and they could well afford
it, anyway. Besides, if there was a squawk, they'd get the negatives free. Some
of them were pretty bad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>So we had the
cash; not too much, but enough to start. Before we took the next step there was
plenty to decide. There are a lot who earn a living by convincing millions that
Sticko soap is better. We had a harder problem than that: we had, first, to
make a salable and profitable product, and. second, we had to convince many,
many millions that our &quot;Product&quot; was absolutely honest and absolutely
accurate. We all know that if you repeat something long enough and loud enough
manyor mostwill accept it as gospel truth. That called for publicity on an
international scale. For the skeptics who know better than to accept
advertising, no matter how blatant, we had to use another technique. And since
we were going to get certainly only one chance, we had to be right the first
time. Without Mike's machine the job would have been impossible; without it the
job would have been un­necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>A lot of
sweat ran under the bridge before we found what we thoughtand we still do!the
only workable scheme. We picked the only possible way to enter every mind in
the world without a fight; the field of entertainment. Absolute secrecy was
imperative, and it was only when we reached the last decimal point that we made
a move. We started like this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>First we
looked for a suitable building, or Mike did, while I flew east, to Rochester,
for a month. The building he rented was an old bank. We had the windows sealed,
a flossy office Medalled in the frontthe bulletproof glass was my ideaair
conditioning, a portable bar, electrical wiring of whatever type Mike's little
heart desired, and a blonde secretary who thought she was working for M-E
Experimental Laboratories. When I got back from Rochester I took over the job
of lisping happy the stone masons and electricians, while Mike tooled around in
our suite in the back where he could look out the window at his old store. The
last I heard, they were making snake oil there. When the Studio, as we came to
call it, was finished, Mike moved in and the blonde settled down to a routine
of reading love stories and saying no to all the salesmen that wandered by. I
left for Hollywood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I spent a
week digging through the files of Central Casting before I was satisfied, but
it took a month of snooping and some under-the-table cash to lease a camera
that would use Trucolor film. That took the biggest load from my mind. When I
got back to Detroit the big view camera had arrived from Rochester, with a
truckload of glass color plates. Ready to go.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>We made quite
a ceremony of it. We closed the Venetian Minds and I popped the cork on one of
the bottles of cham­pagne 1'd bought. The blonde secretary was impressed; all
she'd been doing for her salary was to accept delivery of packages and crates
and boxes. We had no wine glasses, but we made no fuss about it. Too nervous
and excited to drink any more than one bottle, we gave the rest to the blonde
and told her to take the rest of the afternoon off. After she leftand I think
she was disappointed at breaking up what could have been a good partywe locked
up after her, went into the studio itself, locked up again and went to work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I've
mentioned that the windows were sealed. All the inside walls had been painted
dull black, and with the high ceiling that went with that old bank lobby, it
was impress­ive. But not gloomy. Midway in the studio was planted the Trucolor
camera, loaded and ready. Not much could be seen of Mike's machine, but I knew
it was off to the side, set to throw on the back wall. Not <i>on</i> the wall,
understand, because the images produced are projected into the air, like the
meeting of the rays of two searchlights. Mike lifted the lid and I could see
him silhouetted against the tiny lights that lit the dials.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Well?&quot;
he said expectantly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I felt pretty
good just then, right down to my billfold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It's
all yours, Mike,&quot; and a switch ticked over. There he was. There was a
youngster, dead twenty-five hundred years, real enough, almost, to touch.
Alexander. Alexander of Macedon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Let's take
that first picture in detail. I don't think I can ever forget what happened in
the next year or so. First we followed Alexander through his life, from
beginning to end. We skipped, of course, the little things he did, jumping
ahead days and weeks and years at a time. Then we'd miss him, or find that he'd
moved in space. That would mean we'd have to jump back and forth, like the
artillery firing bracket or rang­ing shots, until we found him again. Helped
only occasionally by his published lives, we were astounded to realize how much
distortion has crept into his life. I often wonder why legends arise about the
famous. Certainly their lives are as startling or appalling as fiction. And
unfortunately we had to hold closely to the accepted histories. If we hadn't,
every professor would have gone into his corner for a hearty sneer. We couldn't
take that chance. Not at first.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>After we knew
approximately what had happened and where, we used our notes to go back to what
had seemed a particularly photogenic section and work on that awhile.
Eventually we had a fair idea of what we were actually going to film. Then we
sat down and wrote an actual script to follow, making allowance for whatever
shots we'd have to double in later. Mike used his machine as the projector, and
I operated the Trucolor camera at a fixed focus, like taking moving pictures of
a movie. As fast as we finished a reel it would go to Rochester for processing,
instead of one of the Hollywood outfits that might have done it cheaper.
Rochester is so used to horrible amateur stuff that I doubt if anyone ever looks
at anything. When the reel was returned we'd run it ourselves to check our
choice of scenes and color sense and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>For example,
we had to show the traditional quarrels with his father, Philip. Most of that
we figured on doing with doubles, later. Olympias, his mother, and the fangless
snakes she affected, didn't need any doubling, as we used an angle and amount
of distance that didn't call for actual conversa­tion. The scene where
Alexander rode the bucking horse no one else could ride came out of some
biographer's head, but we thought it was so famous we couldn't leave it out. We
dubbed the closeups later, and the actual horseman was a young Scythian that
hung around the royal stables for his keep. Roxanne was real enough, like the
rest of the Persians' wives that Alexander took over. Luckily most of them had
enough poundage to look luscious. Philip and Parmenio and the rest of the
characters were heavily bearded, which made easy the necessary doubling and
dubbing-in the necessary speech. (If you ever saw them shave in those days,
you'd know why whiskers were popular.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>The most
trouble we had with the interior shots. Smoky wicks in a bowl of lard, no
matter how plentiful, are too dim even for fast film. Mike got around that by
running the Trucolor camera at a single frame a second, with his machine paced
accordingly. That accounts for the startling clarity and depth of focus we got
from a lens well stopped down. We had all the time in the world to choose the
best possible scenes and camera angles; the best actors in the world, expensive
camera booms, or repeated retakes under the most exacting director can't
compete with us. We had a lifetime from which to choose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Eventually we
had on film about eighty per cent of what you saw in the finished picture. Roughly
we spliced the reels together and sat there entranced at what we had actually
done. Even more exciting, even more spectacular than we'd dared to hope, the
lack of continuity and sound didn't stop us from realizing that we'd done a
beautiful job. We'd done all we could, and the worst was yet to come. So we
sent for more champagne and told the blonde we had cause for celebration. She
giggled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What
are you doing in there, anyway?&quot; she asked. &quot;Every salesman who comes
to the door wants to know what you're making.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I opened the
first bottle. &quot;Just tell them you don't know.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That's
just what I've been telling them. They think I'm awfully dumb.&quot; We all
laughed at the salesmen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Mike was
thoughtful. &quot;If we're going to do this sort of thing very often, we ought
to have some of these fancy hol­low-stemmed glasses.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>The blonde
was pleased with that. &quot;And we could keep them in my bottom drawer.&quot;
Her nose wrinkled prettily. &quot;These bubbles You know, this is the only
time I've ever had champagne, except at a wedding, and then it was only one
glass.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Pour
her another,&quot; Mike suggested. &quot;Mine's empty too.&quot; I did.
&quot;What did you do with those bottles you took home last time?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>A blush and a
giggle. &quot;My father wanted to open them, but I told him you said to save it
for a special occasion.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>By that time
I had my feet on her desk. &quot;This is the spe­cial occasion, then,&quot; I
invited. &quot;Have another, Miss . . . what's your first name, anyway? I hate
being formal after working hours.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>She was
shocked. &quot;And you and Mr. Laviada sign my checks every week! It's
Ruth.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Ruth.
Ruth.&quot; I rolled it around the piercing bubbles, and it sounded all right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>She nodded.
&quot;And your name is Edward, and Mr. Laviada's is Migwell. Isn't it?&quot;
And she smiled at him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;MiGELL,&quot;
he smiled back. &quot;An old Spanish custom. Usually shortened to Mike.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;If
you'll hand me another bottle,&quot; I offered, &quot;shorten Edward to
Ed.&quot; She handed it over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>By the time
we got to the fourth bottle we were as thick as bugs in a rug. It seems that
she was twenty-four, free, white, and single, and loved champagne.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;But,&quot;
she burbled fretfully, &quot;I wish I knew what you were doing in there all
hours of the day and night. I know you're here at night sometimes because I've
seen your car out in front.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Mike thought
that over. &quot;Well,&quot; he said a little unstead­ily, &quot;we take
pictures.&quot; He blinked one eye. &quot;Might even take pictures of you if we
were approached properly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I took over.
&quot;We take pictures of models.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Oh,
no.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes.
Models of things and people and what not. Little ones. We make it look like
it's real.&quot; I think she was a trifle disappointed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Well,
now I know, and that makes me feel better. I sign all those bills from
Rochester and I don't know what I'm signing for. Except that they must be film
or something.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That's
just what it is; film and things like that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Well,
it bothered meNo, there's two more behind the fan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Only two
more. She had a capacity. I asked her how she would like a vacation. She hadn't
thought about a vacation just yet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I 'told her
she'd better start thinking about it. &quot;We're leav­ing day after tomorrow
for Los Angeles, Hollywood.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;The day
after tomorrow? Why&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I reassured
her. &quot;You'll get paid just the same. But there's no telling how long we'll
be gone, and there doesn't seem to be much use in your sitting around here with
nothing to do.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>From Mike
&quot;Let's have that bottle,&quot; and I handed it to him. I went on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You'll
get your checks just the same. If you want, we'll pay you in advance so&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I was getting
full of champagne, and so were we all. Mike was humming softly to himself,
happy as a taco. The blonde, Ruth, was having a little trouble with my left
eye. I knew just how she felt, because I was having a little trouble watching
where she overlapped the swivel chair. Blue eyes, sooo tall, fuzzy hair.
Hm-m-m. All work and no play She handed me the last bottle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Demurely she
hid a tiny hiccup. &quot;I'm going to save all the corks No I won't either. My
father would want to know what I'm thinking of, drinking with my bosses.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I said it
wasn't a good idea to annoy your father. Mike said why fool with bad ideas,
when he had a good one. We were interested. Nothing like a good idea to liven
things up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Mike was
expansive as the very devil. &quot;Going to Los Angeles.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>We nodded
solemnly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Going
to Los Angeles to work.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Another nod.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Going
to work in Los Angeles. What will we do for pretty blonde girl to write
letters?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Awful. No
pretty blonde to write letters and drink cham­pagne. Sad case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Gotta hire
somebody to write letters anyway. Might not be blonde. No blondes in Hollywood.
No good ones, anyway. So&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I saw the
wonderful idea, and finished for him. &quot;So we take pretty blonde to Los
Angeles to write letters!&quot; What an idea that was! One bottle sooner and
its brilliancy would have been dimmed. Ruth bubbled like a fresh bottle and
Mike and I sat there, smirking like mad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;But I
can't! I couldn't leave day after tomorrow just like that!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Mike was
magnificent. &quot;Who said day after tomorrow? Changed our minds. Leave right
now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>She was
appalled. &quot;Right now! Just like that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Right
now. Just like that.&quot; I was firm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;But&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No
buts. Right now. Just like that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Nothing
to wear&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Buy
clothes any place. Best ones in Los Angeles.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;But my
hair&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Mike suggested
a haircut in Hollywood, maybe?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I pounded the
table. It felt solid. &quot;Call the airport. Three tickets.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>She called
the airport. She intimidated easy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>The airport
said we could leave for Chicago any time on the hour, and change there for Los
Angeles. Mike wanted to know why she was wasting time on the telephone when we
could be on our way. Holding up the wheels of progress, emery dust in the
gears. One minute to get her hat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Call
Pappy from the airport.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Her
objections were easily brushed away with a few word-pictures of how much fun
there was to be had in Hollywood. We left a sign on the door, &quot;Gone to
LunchBack in Decem­ber,&quot; and made the airport in time for the four
o'clock plane, with no time left to call Pappy. I told the parking attendant to
hold the car until he heard from me and we made it up the steps and into the
plane just in time. The steps were taken away, the motors snorted, and we were
off, with Ruth holding fast to her hat in an imaginary breeze.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>There was a
two-hour layover in Chicago. They don't serve liquor at the airport, but an
obliging cab driver found us a convenient bar down the road, where Ruth made
her call to her father. Cautiously we stayed away from the tele­phone booth,
but from what Ruth told us, he must have read her the riot act. The bartender
didn't have champagne, but gave us the special treatment reserved for those
that order it. The cab driver saw that we made the liner two hours later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>In Los
Angeles we registered at the Commodore, cold sober and ashamed of ourselves. The
next day Ruth went shopping for clothes for herself, and for us. We gave her
the sizes and enough money to soothe her hangover. Mike and I did some
telephoning. After breakfast we sat around until the desk clerk announced a Mr.
Lee Johnson to see us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Lee Johnson
was the brisk professional type, the high-bracket salesman. Tall, rather
homely, a clipped way of talk­ing. We introduced ourselves, as embryo
producers. His eyes brightened when we said that. His meat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Not
exactly the way you think,&quot; I told him. &quot;We have already eighty per
cent or better of the final print.&quot; He wanted to know where he came in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We have
several thousand feet of Trucolor film. Don't bother asking where or when we
got it. This footage is silent. We'll need sound and, in places, speech dubbed
in.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>He nodded.
&quot;Easy enough. What condition is the master?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Perfect
condition. It's in the hotel vault right now. There are gaps in the story to
fill. Well need quite a few male and female characters. And all of these will
have to do their doubling for cash, and not for screen credit.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Johnson
raised his eyebrows. &quot;And why? Out here screen credit is bread and
butter.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Several
reasons. This footage was madenever mind wherewith the understanding that
film credit would favor no one.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;If you're
lucky enough to catch your talent between pic­tures you might get away with it.
But if your footage is worth working with, my boys will want screen credit. And
I think they're entitled to it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I said that
was reasonable enough. The technical crews were essential, and I was prepared
to pay well. Particularly to keep their mouths closed until the print was ready
for final release. Maybe even after that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Before
we go any further,&quot; Johnson rose and reached for his hat, &quot;let's take
a look at that print. I don't know if we can&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I knew what
he was thinking. Amateurs. Home movies. Feelthy peekchures, mebbe?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>We got the
reels out of the hotel safe and drove to his laboratory, out Sunset. The top
was down on his convertible and Mike hoped audibly that Ruth would have sense
enough to get sport shirts that didn't itch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Wife?&quot;
Johnson asked carelessly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Secretary,&quot;
Mike answered just as casually. &quot;We flew in last night and she's out
getting us some light clothes.&quot; Johnson's estimation of us rose visibly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>A porter came
out of the laboratory to carry the suitcase containing the film reels. It was a
long, low building, with the offices at the front and the actual laboratories
tapering off at the rear. Johnson took us in the side door and called for
someone whose name we didn't catch. The anonymous one was a projectionist who
took the reels and disappeared into the back of the projection room. We sat for
a minute in the soft easychairs until the projectionist buzzed ready. Johnson
glanced at us and we nodded. He clicked a switch on the arm of his chair and
the overhead lights went out. The pic­ture started.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>It ran a
hundred and ten minutes as it stood. We both watched Johnson like a cat at a
rathole. When the tag end showed white on the screen he signaled with the chair-side
buzzer for lights. They came on. He faced us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Where
did you get that print?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Mike grinned
at him. &quot;Can we do business?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Do
business?&quot; He was vehement. &quot;You bet your life we can do business.
We'll do the greatest business you ever saw!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>The projection
man came down. &quot;Hey, that's all right. Where'd you get it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Mike looked
at me. I said, &quot;This isn't to go any further.&quot; Johnson looked at his
man, who shrugged. &quot;None of my business.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I dangled the
hook. &quot;That wasn't made here. Never mind where.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Johnson rose
and struck, hook, line and sinker. &quot;Europe! Hm-m-m. Germany. No, France.
Russia, maybe, Einstein, or Eisenstein, or whatever his name is?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I shook my
head. &quot;That doesn't matter. The leads are all dead, or out of commission,
but their heirs . . . well, you get what I mean.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Johnson saw
what I meant. &quot;Absolutely right. No point tak­ing any chances. Where's the
rest?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Who
knows? We were lucky to salvage that much. Can do?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Can
do.&quot; He thought for a minute. &quot;Get Bernstein in here. Better get
Kessler and Marrs, too.&quot; The projectionist left. In a few minutes Kessler,
a heavyset man, and Marrs, a young, nervous chain-smoker, came in with
Bernstein, the sound man. We were introduced all around and Johnson asked if we
minded sitting through another showing. &quot;Nope. We like it better than you
do.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Not quite.
Kessler and Marrs and Bernstein, the minute the film was over, bombarded us
with startled questions. We gave them the same answers we'd given Johnson. But
we were pleased with the reception, and said so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Kessler
grunted. &quot;I'd like to know who was behind that camera. Best I've seen, by
Cripes, since 'Ben Hur.' Better than 'Ben Hur.' The boy's good.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I grunted
right back at him. &quot;That's the only thing I can tell you. The photography
was done by the boys you're talk­ing to right now. Thanks for the kind
word.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>All four of
them stared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Mike said,
&quot;That's right.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Hey,
hey!&quot; from Marrs. They all looked at us with new respect. It felt good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Johnson broke
into the silence when it became awkward. &quot;What's next on the score
card?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>We got down
to cases. Mike, as usual, was content to sit there with his eyes half closed,
taking it all in, letting me do all the talking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We want
sound dubbed in all the way through.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Pleasure,&quot;
said Bernstein.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;At
least a dozen, maybe more, of speaking actors with a close resemblance to the
leads you've seen.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Johnson was
confident. &quot;Easy. Central Casting has everybody's picture since the Year
One.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I know.
We've already checked that. No trouble there. They'll have to take the cash and
let the credit go, for rea­sons I've already explained to Mr. Johnson.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>A moan from
Marrs. &quot;I bet I get that job.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Johnson was
snappish. &quot;You do. What else?&quot; to me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I didn't
know. &quot;Except that we have no plans for distribu­tion as yet. That will
have to be worked out.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Like
falling off a log.&quot; Johnson was happy about that. &quot;One look at the
rushes and United Artists would spit in Shakespeare's eye.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Marrs came
in. &quot;What about the other shots? Got a writer lined up?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We've
got what will pass for the shooting script, or would have in a week or so. Want
to go over it with us?&quot; He'd like that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;How
much time have we got?&quot; interposed Kessler. &quot;This is going to be a
job. When do we want it?&quot; Already it was &quot;we.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yesterday
is when we want it,&quot; snapped Johnson, and he rose. &quot;Any ideas about
music? No? We'll try for Werner Janssen and his boys. Berstein, you're
responsible for that print from now on. Kessler, get your crew in and have a
look at it. Marrs, you'll go with Mr. Lefko and Mr. Laviada through the files
at Central Casting at their convenience. Keep in touch with them at the
Commodore. Now, if you'll step into my office, we'll discuss the financial
arrangements&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>As easy as
all that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Oh, I don't
say that it was easy work or anything like that, because in the next few months
we were playing Busy Bee. What with running down the only one registered at
Central Casting who looked like Alexander himself, he turned out to be a young
Armenian who had given up hope of ever being called from the extra lists and
had gone home to Santeecasting and rehearsing the rest of the actors and swear­ing
at the costumers and the boys who built the sets, we were kept hopping. Even
Ruth, who had reconciled her father with soothing letters, for once earned her
salary. We took turns shooting dictation at her until we had a script that
satisfied Mike and myself and young Marrs, who turned out to be clever as a fox
on dialogue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>What I really
meant is that it was easy, and immensely gratifying, to crack the shell of the tough
boys who had seen epics and turkeys come and go. They were really impressed by
what we had done. Kessler was disappointed when we refused to be bothered with
photographing the rest of the film. We just batted our eyes and said that we
were too busy, that we were perfectly confident that he would do as well as we
could. He outdid himself, and us. I don't know what we would have done if he
had asked us for any concrete advice. I suppose, when I think it all over, that
the boys we met and worked with were so tired of working with the usual
mine-run Grade B's, that they were glad to meet someone that knew the
difference between glycerin tears and reality and didn't care if it cost two
dollars extra. They had us placed as a couple of city slickers with plenty on
the ball. I hope.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Finally it
was all over with. We all sat in the projection room; Mike and I, Marrs and
Johnson, Kessler and Bernstein, and all the lesser technicians that had split
up the really enormous amount of work that had been done watched the finished
product. It was terrific. Everyone had done his work well. When Alexander came
on the screen, he was Alexander the Great. (The Armenian kid got a good bonus
for that.) All that blazing color, all that wealth and magnificence and glamor
seemed to flare right out of the screen and sear across your mind. Even Mike
and I, who had seen the original, were on the edge of our seats.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>The sheer
realism and magnitude of the battle scenes, I think, really made the picture.
Gore, of course, is glorious when it's all make-believe and the dead get up to
go to lunch. But when Bill Mauldin sees a picture and sells a breathless
article on the similarity of infantrymen of all ageswell, Mauldin knows what
war is like. So did the infantrymen throughout the world who wrote letters
comparing Alexan­der's Arbela to Anzio and the Argonne. The weary peasant, not
stolid at all, trudging and trudging into mile after mile of those dust-laden
plains and ending as a stinking, naked, ripped corpse peeping under a mound of
flies isn't any dif­ferent when he carries a sarissa instead of a rifle. That
we'd tried to make obvious, and we succeeded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>When the
lights came up in the projection room we knew we had a winner. Individually we
shook hands all around, proud as a bunch of penguins, and with chests out as
far. The rest of the men filed out and we retired to Johnson's of­fice. He
poured a drink all around and got down to business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;How
about releases?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I asked him
what he thought.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Write
your own ticket,&quot; he shrugged. &quot;I don't know whether or not you know
it, but the word has already gone around that you've got something.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I told him
we'd had calls at the hotel from various sources, and named them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;See
what I mean? I know those babies. Kiss them out if you want to keep your shirt.
And while I'm at it, you owe us quite a bit. I suppose you've got it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We've
got it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I was
afraid you would. If you didn't, I'd be the one that would have your
shirt.&quot; He grinned, but we all knew he meant it. &quot;All right, that's settled.
Let's talk about release.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;There
are two or three outfits around town that will want a crack at it. My boys will
have the word spread around in no time; there's no point in trying to keep them
quiet any longer. I knowthey'll have sense enough not to talk about the things
you want off the record. I'll see to that. But you're top dog right now. You
got loose cash, you've got the biggest potential gross I've ever seen, and you
don't have to take the first offer. That's important, in this game.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;How would
you like to handle it yourself?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I'd
like to try. The outfit I'm thinking of needs a feature right now, and they
don't know I know it. They'll pay and pay. What's in it for me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That,&quot;
I said, &quot;we can talk about later. And I think I know just what you're
thinking. We'll take the usual terms and we don't care if you hold up whoever
you deal with. What we don't know won't hurt us.&quot; That's what he was
thinking, all right. That's a cutthroat game out there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Good.
Kessler, get your setup ready for duplication.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Always
ready.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Marrs,
start the ball rolling on publicity . . . what do you want to do about
that?&quot; to us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Mike and I
had talked about that before. &quot;As far as we're concerned,&quot; I said
slowly, &quot;do as you think best. Personal publicity, O.K. We won't look for
it, but we won't dodge it. As far as that goes, we're the local yokels making
good. Soft pedal any questions about where the picture was made, without being
too obvious. You're going to have trouble when you talk about the nonexistent
actors, but you ought to be able to figure out something.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Marrs groaned
and Johnson grinned. &quot;He'll figure out something.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;As far
as technical credit goes, we'll be glad to see you get all you can, because
you've done a swell job.&quot; Kessler took that as a personal compliment, and
it was. &quot;You might as well know now, before we go any further, that some
of the work came right from Detroit.&quot; They all sat up at that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Mike
and I have a new process of model and trick work.&quot; Kessler opened his
mouth to say something but thought better of it. &quot;We're not going to say
what was done, or how much was done in the laboratory, but you'll admit that it
defies detection.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>About that
they were fervent. &quot;I'll say it defies detection. In the game this long
and process work gets by me . . . where&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I'm not
going to tell you that. What we've got isn't pat­ented and won't be, as long as
we can hold it up.&quot; There wasn't any griping there. These men knew process
work when they saw it. If they didn't see it, it was good. They could understand
why we'd want to keep a process that good a se­cret.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We can
practically guarantee there'll be more work for you to do later on.&quot; Their
interest was plain. &quot;We're not going to predict when, or make any definite
arrangement, but we still have a trick or two in the deck. We like the way
we've been getting along, and we want to stay that way. Now, if you'll excuse
us, we have a date with a blonde.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Johnson was
right about the bidding for the release. Weor rather Johnsonmade a very
profitable deal with United Amusement and the affiliated theaters. Johnson, the
bandit, got his percentage from us and likely did better with United. Kessler
and Johnson's boys took huge ads in the trade jour­nals to boast about their
connections with the Academy Award Winner. Not only the Academy, but every
award that ever went to any picture. Even the Europeans went overboard. They're
the ones that make a fetish of realism. They knew the real thing when they saw
it, and so did everyone else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Our success
went to Ruth's head. In no time she wanted a secretary. At that, she needed one
to fend off the screwballs that popped out of the woodwork. So we let her hire
a girl to help out. She picked a good typist, about fifty. Ruth is a smart
girl, in a lot of ways. He father showed signs of wanting to see the Pacific,
so we raised her salary on condi­tion he'd stay away. The three of us were
having too much fun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>The picture
opened at the same time in both New York and Hollywood. We went to the premiere
in great style with Ruth between us, swollen like a trio of bullfrogs. It's a
great feeling to sit on the floor, early in the morning, and read reviews that
make you feel like floating. It's a better feeling to have a mintful of money.
Johnson and his men were right along with us. I don't think he could have been
too flush in the beginning, and we all got a kick out of riding the crest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>It was a good
sized wave, too. We had all the personal pub­licity we wanted, and more.
Somehow the word was out that we had a new gadget for process photography, and
every big studio in town was after what they thought would be a mighty
economical thing to have around. The studios that didn't have a spectacle
scheduled looked at the receipts of &quot;Alexander&quot; and promptly
scheduled a spectacle. We drew some very good offers, Johnson said, but we made
a series of long faces and broke the news that we were leaving for Detroit the
next day, and to hold the fort awhile. I don't think he thought we actually
meant it, but we did. We left the next day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Back in
Detroit we went right to work, helped by the knowledge that we were on the
right track. Ruth was kept busy turning away the countless would be visitors.
We ad­mitted no reporters, no salesmen, no one. We had no time. We were using
the view camera. Plate after plate we sent to Rochester for developing. A print
of each was returned to us and the plate was held in Rochester for our
disposal. We sent to New York for a representative of one of the biggest
publishers in the country. We made a deal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Your main
library has a set of the books we published, if you're interested. Huge heavy
volumes, hundreds of them, each page a razor-sharp blowup from an 8x10
negative. A set of those books went to every major library and university in
the world. Mike and I got a real kick out of solving some of the problems that
have had savants guessing for years. In the Roman volume, for example, we
solved the trireme problem with a series of pictures, not only the interior of
a trireme, but a line-of-battle quinquereme. (Naturally, the professors and
amateur yachtsmen weren't convinced at all.) We had a series of aerial shots of
the City of Rome taken a hundred years apart, over a millennium. Aerial views
of Ravenna and Londinium, Palmyra and Pompeii, of Eboracum and Byzantium. Oh,
we had the time of our lives! We had a volume for Greece and for Rome, for
Persia and for Crete, for Egypt and for the Eastern Empire. We had pictures of
the Parthenon and the Pharos, pictures of Hannibal and Carac­tacus and
Vercingetorix, pictures of the Walls of Babylon and the building of the
pyramids and the palace of Sargon, pages from the Lost Books of Livy and the
plays of Euripides. Things like that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Terrifically
expensive, a second printing sold at cost to a surprising number of private
individuals. If the cost had been less, historical interest would have become
even more the fad of the moment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>When the
flurry had almost died down, some Italian dig­ging in the hitherto unexcavated
section of ash-buried Pom­peii, dug right into a tiny buried temple right where
our aerial shot had showed it to be. His budget was expanded and he found more
ash-covered ruins that agreed with our aerial layout, ruins that hadn't seen
the light of day for almost two thousand years. Everyone promptly wailed that
we were the luckiest guessers in captivity; the head of some California cult
suspected aloud that we were the reincarna­tions of two gladiators named Joe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>To get some
peace and quiet Mike and I moved into our studio, lock, stock, and underwear.
The old bank vault had never been removed, at our request, and it served well
to store our equipment when we weren't around. All the mail Ruth couldn't
handle we disposed of, unread; the old bank building began to look like a well
patronized soup kitchen. We hired burly private detectives to handle the more
ob­noxious visitors and subscribed to a telegraphic protective service. We had
another job to do, another full-length fea­ture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>We still
stuck to the old historical theme. This time we tried to do what Gibbon did in
The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. And, I think, we were rather
successful, at that. In four hours you can't completely cover two thousand
years, but you can, as we did, show the cracking up of a great civilization,
and how painful the process can be. The criticism we drew for almost ignoring
Christ and Christianity was unjust, we think, and unfair. Very few knew then,
or know now, that we had included, as a kind of trial balloon, some footage of
Christ Himself, and His time. This footage we had to cut. The Board of Review,
as you know, is both Catholic and Protestant. Theythe Boardwent right up in
arms. We didn't protest very hard when they claimed our &quot;treatment&quot;
was irreverent, indecent, and biased and inaccurate &quot;by any Christian
standard.&quot; &quot;Why,&quot; they wailed, &quot;it doesn't even look like
Him,&quot; and they were right; it didn't. Not any picture they ever saw. Right
then and there we de­cided that it didn't pay to tamper with anyone's religious
beliefs. That's why you've never seen anything emanating from us that conflicted
even remotely with the accepted his­torical, sociological, or religious
features of Someone Who Knew Better. That Roman picture, by the way,but not ac­cidentallydeviated
so little from the textbooks you conned in school that only a few enthusiastic
specialists called our attention to what they insisted were errors. We were
still in no position to do any mass rewriting of history, because we were
unable to reveal just where we got our information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Johnson, when
he sat in the Roman epic, mentally clicked high his heels. His men went right
to work, and we handled the job as we had the first. One day Kessler got me in
a corner, dead earnest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Ed,&quot;
he said, &quot;I'm going to find out where you got that footage if it's the
last thing I ever do.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I told him that
some day he would.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;And I
don't mean some day, either; I mean right now. That bushwa about Europe might
go once, but not twice. I know better, and so does everyone else. Now, what
about it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I told him
I'd have to consult Mike and I did. We were up against it. We called a
conference.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Kessler
tells me he has troubles. I guess you all know what they are.&quot; They all
knew.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Johnson spoke
up. &quot;He's right, too. We know better. Where did you get it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I turned to
Mike. &quot;Want to do the talking?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>A shake of
his head. &quot;You're doing all right.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;All
right.&quot; Kessler hunched a little forward and Marrs lit another cigarette.
&quot;We weren't lying and we weren't exag­gerating when we said the actual
photography was ours. Every frame of film was taken right here in this country,
within the last few months. Just howI won't mention why or wherewe can't tell
you just now.&quot; Kessler snorted in disgust. &quot;Let me finish.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We all
know that we're cashing in, hand over fist. And we're going to cash in some
more. We have, on our per­sonal schedule, five more pictures. Three of that
five we want you to handle as you did the others. The last two of the five will
show you both the reason for all the childish se­crecy, as Kessler calls it,
and another motive that we have so far kept hidden. The last two pictures will
show you both our motives and our methods; one is as important as the other.
Nowis that enough? Can we go ahead on that basis?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>It wasn't
enough for Kessler. &quot;That doesn't mean a thing to me. What are we, a bunch
of hacks?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Johnson was
thinking about his bank balance. &quot;Five more. Two years, maybe four.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Marrs was
skeptical. &quot;Who do you think you're going to kid that long? Where's your
studio? Where's your talent? Where do you shoot your exteriors? Where do you
get costumes and your extras? In one single shot you've got forty thousand
extras, if you've got one! Maybe you can shut me up, but who's going to answer
the questions that Metro and Fox and Paramount and RKO have been asking? Those
boys aren't fools, they know their business. How do you expect me to handle any
publicity when I don't know what the score is, myself?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Johnson told
him to pipe down for a while and let him think. Mike and I didn't like this one
bit. But what could we dotell the truth and end up in a straitjacket?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Can we
do it this way?&quot; he finally asked. &quot;Marrs: these boys have an in with
the Soviet Government. They work in some place in Siberia, maybe. Nobody gets
within miles of there. No one ever knows what the Russians are doing&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Nope!&quot;
Marrs was definite. &quot;Any hint that these came from Russia and we'd all be
a bunch of Reds. Cut the gross in half.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Johnson began
to pick up speed. &quot;All right, not from Rus­sia. From one of these little
republics fringed around Siberia or Armenia or one of those places. They're not
Russian-made films at all. In fact, they've been made by some of these Germans
and Austrians the Russians took over and moved after the War. The war fever had
died down enough for peo­ple to realize that the Germans knew their stuff
occasionally. The old sympathy racket for these refugees struggling with faulty
equipment, lousy climate, making super-spectacles and smuggling them out under
the nose of the Gestapo or whatever they call it That's it!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Doubtfully,
from Marrs: &quot;And the Russians tell the world we're nuts, that they haven't
got any loose Germans?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>That, Johnson
overrode. &quot;Who reads the back pages? Who pays any attention to what the
Russians say? Who cares? They might even think we're telling the truth and
start looking around their own backyard for something that isn't there! All
right with you?&quot; to Mike and myself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I looked at
Mike and he looked at me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;O.K.
with us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;O.K.
with the rest of you? Kessler? Bernstein?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>They weren't
too agreeable, and certainly not happy, but they agreed to play games until we
gave the word. We were warm in our thanks. &quot;You won't regret it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Kessler
doubted that very much, but Johnson eased them all out, back to work. Another
hurdle leaped, or sidestepped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Rome&quot;
was released on schedule and drew the same friendly reviews.
&quot;Friendly&quot; is the wrong word for reviews that stretched ticket
lineups blocks long. Marrs did a good job on the publicity. Even that chain of
newspapers that afterward turned on us so viciously fell for Marrs' word
wizardry and ran full-page editorials urging the reader to see
&quot;Rome.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>With our
third picture, &quot;Flame Over France,&quot; we cor­rected a few
misconceptions about the French Revolution, and began stepping on a few tender
toes. Luckily, however, and not altogether by design, there happened to be in
power in Paris a liberal government. They backed us to the hilt with the
confirmation we needed. At our request they released a lot of documents that
had hitherto conveniently been lost in the cavernous recesses of the
Bibliotheque Na­tionale. I've forgotten the name of whoever happened to be the
perennial pretender to the French throne. At, I'm sure, the subtle prodding of
one of Marrs' ubiquitous publicity men, the pretender sued us for our whole
net, alleging the defamation of the good name of the Bourbons. A lawyer Johnson
dug up for us sucked the poor chump into a courtroom and cut him to bits. Not
even six cents damages did he get. Samuels, the lawyer, and Marrs drew a
good-sized bonus, and the pretender moved to Honduras.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Somewhere
around this point, I believe, did the tone of the press begin to change. Up
until then we'd been regarded as crosses between Shakespeare and Barnum. Since
long obscure facts had been dredged into the light, a few well-known pessimists
began to wonder sotto voce if we weren't just a pair of blasted pests.
&quot;Should leave well enough alone.&quot; Only our huge advertising budget
kept them from saying more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I'm going to
stop right here and say something about our personal life while all this was going
on. Mike I've kept in the background pretty well, mostly because he wants it
that way. He lets me do all the talking and stick my neck out while he sits in
the most comfortable chair in sight. I yell and I argue and he just sits there;
hardly ever a word coming out of that dark-brown pan, certainly never an indica­tion
showing that behind those polite eyebrows there's a brainand a sense of humor
and witfaster and as deadly as a bear trap. Oh, I know we've played around,
sometimes with a loud bang, but we've been, ordinarily, too busy and too
preoccupied with what we were doing to waste any time. Ruth, while she was with
us, was a good dancing and drink­ing partner. She was young, she was almost
what you'd call beautiful, and she seemed to like being with us. For a while I
had a few ideas about her that might have developed into something serious. We
bothI should say, all three of usfound out in time that we looked at a lot of
things too dif­ferently. So we weren't too disappointed when she signed with
Metro. Her contract meant what she thought was all the fame and money and
happiness in the world, plus the personal at­tention she was doubtless entitled
to have. They put her in Class B's and serials and she, financially, is better
off than she ever expected to be. Emotionally, I don't know. We heard from her
sometime ago, and I think she's about due for another divorce. Maybe it's just
as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>But let's get
away from Ruth. I'm ahead of myself. All this time Mike and I had been working
together, our approach to the final payoff had been divergent. Mike was hopped
on the idea of making a better world, and doing that by making war impossible.
&quot;War,&quot; he's often said, &quot;war of any kind is what has made man
spend most of his history in merely staying alive. Now, with the atom to use,
he has within himself the seed of self-extermination. So help me, Ed, I'm going
to do my share of stopping that, or I don't see any point in living. I mean
it!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>He did mean
it. He told me that in almost the same words the first day we met. Then I
tagged that idea as a pipe dream picked up on an empty stomach. I saw his
machine only as a path to luxurious and personal Nirvana, and I thought he'd
soon be going my way. I was wrong.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>You can't
live, or work, with a likable person without admiring some of the qualities
that make that person likable. Another thing; it's a lot easier to worry about
the woes of the world when you haven't any yourself. It's a lot easier to have
a conscience when you can afford it. When I donned the rose-colored glasses
half my battle was won; when I realized how grand a world this could be, the
battle was over. That was about the time of &quot;Flame Over France,&quot; I
think. The actual time isn't important. What is important is that, from that
time on, we became the tightest team possible. Since then the only thing we've
differed on would be the time to knock off for a sandwich. Most of our leisure
time, what we had of it, has been spent in locking up for the night, rolling
out the portable bar, opening just enough beer to feel good, and relaxing.
Maybe, after one or two, we might diddle the dials of the machine, and go
rambling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Together
we've been everywhere and seen anything. It might be a good night to check up
on Francois Villon, the faker, or maybe we might chase around with
Haroun-el-Rashid. (If there was ever a man born a few hundred years too soon,
it was that careless caliph.) Or if we were in a bad or discouraged mood we
might follow the Thirty Years' War for a while, or if we were real raffish we
might inspect the dressing rooms at Radio City. For Mike the crackup of At­lantis
has always had an odd fascination, probably because he's afraid that man will
do it again, now that he's redis­covered nuclear energy. And if I doze off he's
quite apt to go back to the very Beginning, back to the start of the world as
we know it now. (It wouldn't do any good to tell you what went before that.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>When I stop
to think, it's probably just as well that neither of us married. We, of course,
have hopes for the future, but at present we're both tired of the whole human
race; tired of greedy faces and hands. With a world that puts a premium on
wealth and power and strength, it's no wonder what de­cency there is stems from
fear of what's here now, or fear of what's hereafter. We've seen so much of the
hidden actions of the worldcall it snooping, if you likethat we've learned to
disregard the surface indications of kindness and good. Only once did Mike and
I ever look into the private life of someone we knew and liked and respected.
Once was enough. From that day on we made it a point to take people as they
seemed. Let's get away from that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>The next two
pictures we released in rapid succession; the first, &quot;Freedom for
Americans,&quot; the American Revolution, and &quot;The Brothers and the Guns,&quot;
the American Civil War. Bang! Every third politician, a lot of so-called
&quot;educators,&quot; and all the professional patriots started after our
scalps. Every single chapter of the DAR, the Sons of Union Vet­erans, and the
Daughters of the Confederacy pounded their collective heads against the wall.
The South went frantic; every state in the Deep South and one state on the
border flatly banned both pictures, the second because it was truth­ful, and
the first because censorship is a contagious disease. They stayed banned until
the professional politicians got wise. The bans were revoked, and the
choke-collar and string-tie brigade pointed to both pictures as horrible
examples of what some people actually believed and thought, and felt pleased
that someone had given them an opportunity to roll out the barrel and beat the
drums that sound sectional and racial hatred.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>New England
was tempted to stand on its dignity, but couldn't stand the strain. North of
New York both pictures were banned. In New York state the rural representatives
voted en bloc, and the ban was clamped on statewide. Spe­cial trains ran to
Delaware, where the corporations were too busy to pass another law. Libel suits
flew like spaghetti, and although the extras blared the filing of each new
suit, very few knew that we lost not one. Although we had to appeal almost very
suit to higher courts, and in some cases request a change of venue which was
seldom granted, the documen­tary proof furnished by the record cleared us once
we got to a judge, or series of judges, with no fences to mend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>It was a
mighty rasp we drew over wounded ancestral pride. We had shown that not all the
mighty had haloes of purest gold, that not all the Redcoats were strutting
bulliesnor angels, and the British Empire, except South Africa, refused entry
to both pictures and made violent passes at the State Department. The spectacle
of Southern and New Eng­land congressmen approving the efforts of a foreign am­bassador
to suppress free speech drew hilarious hosannas from certain quarters. H. L.
Mencken gloated in the clover, doing loud nip-ups, and the newspapers hung on
the triple-horned dilemma of anti-foreign, pro-patriotic, and quasi-logical
criticism. In Detroit the Ku Klux Klan fired an anemic cross on our doorstep,
and the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, the NAACP, and the WCTU passed flattering
reso­lutions. We forwarded the most vicious and obscene letters together with
a few names and addresses that hadn't been originally signedto our lawyers and
the Post Office Depart­ment. There were no convictions south of Illinois.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Johnson and
his boys made hay. Johnson had pyramided his bets into an international
distributing organization, and pushed Marrs into hiring every top press agent
either side of the Rockies. What a job they did! In no time at all there were
two definite schools of thought that overflowed into the public letters boxes.
One school held that we had no business raking up old mud to throw, that such
things were better left forgotten and forgiven, that nothing wrong had ever
happened, and if it had, we were liars anyway. The other school reasoned more
to our liking. Softly and slowly at first, then with a triumphant shout, this
fact began to emerge; such things had actually happened, and could happen
again, were possibly happening even now; had happened because twisted truth had
too long left its imprint on in­ternational, sectional, and racial feelings. It
pleased us when many began to agree, with us, that it is important to forget
the past, but that it is even more important to understand and evaluate it with
a generous and unjaundiced eye. That was what we were trying to bring out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>The banning
that occurred in the various states hurt the gross receipts only a little, and
we were vindicated in Johnson's mind. He had dolefully predicted loss of half
the na­tional gross because &quot;you can't tell the truth in a movie and get
away with it. Not if the house holds over three hundred.&quot; Not even on the
stage? &quot;Who goes to anything but a movie?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>So far things
had gone just about as we'd planned. We'd earned and received more publicity,
favorable and otherwise, than anyone living. Most of it stemmed from the fact
that our doing had been newsworthy. Some, naturally, had been the
ninety-day-wonder material that fills a thirsty newspaper. We had been very
careful to make our enemies in the strata that can afford to fight back.
Remember the old saw about knowing a man by the enemies he makes? Well, pub­licity
was our ax. Here's how we put an edge on it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I called

What's the pitch, Ed?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I want
some lipreaders. And I want them yesterday, like you tell your boys.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Lipreaders?
Are you nuts? What do you want with lipreaders?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Never

What do you want them for?&quot; &quot;I said, can you get them?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>He was
doubtful. &quot;I think you've been working too hard.&quot; &quot;Look&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Now, I
didn't say I couldn't. Cool off. When do you want them? And how many?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Better
write this down. Ready? I want lipreaders for these languages: English, French,
German, Russian, Chinese, Jap­anese, Greek, Belgian, Dutch and Spanish.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Ed
Lefko, have you gone crazy?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I guess it
didn't sound very sensible, at that. &quot;Maybe I have. But those languages
are essential. If you run across any who can work in any other language, hang
on to them. I might need them, too.&quot; I could see him sitting in front of
his telephone, wagging his head like mad. Crazy. The heat must have got Lefko,
good old Ed. &quot;Did you hear what I said?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes, I
heard you. If this is a rib&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No rib.
Dead serious.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>He began to
get mad. &quot;Where you think I'm going to get lip readers, out of my
hat?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That's
your worry. I'd suggest you start with the local School for the Deaf.&quot; He
was silent. &quot;Now, get this into your head; this isn't a rib, this is the
real thing. I don't care what you do, or where you go, or what you spendI want
those lip readers in Hollywood when we get there or I want to know they're on
the way.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;When
are you going to get there?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I said I
wasn't sure. &quot;Probably a day or two. We've got a few loose ends to clean
up.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>He swore a
blue streak at the iniquities of fate. &quot;You'd better have a good story
when you do&quot; I hung up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Mike met me
at the studio. &quot;Talk to Johnson?&quot; I told him, and he laughed.
&quot;Does sound crazy, I suppose. But he'll get them, if they exist and like
money. He's the Original Resourceful Man.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I tossed my
hat in a corner. &quot;I'm glad this is about over. Your end caught up?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Set and
ready to go. The films and the notes are on the way, the real estate company is
ready to take over the lease, and the girls are paid up to date, with a little
extra.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I opened a
bottle of beer for myself. Mike had one. &quot;How about the office files? How
about the bar, here?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;The files
go to the bank to be stored. The bar? Hadn't thought about it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>The beer was
cold. &quot;Have it crated and send it to Johnson.&quot; We grinned, together.
&quot;Johnson it is. He'll need it.&quot; I nodded at the machine. &quot;What
about that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That
goes with us on the plane as air express.&quot; He looked closely at me.
&quot;What's the matter with youjitters?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Nope.
Willies. Same thing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Me,

slowly, &quot;A lot different.&quot; I opened another beer. &quot;Anything you
want around here, anything else to be done?&quot; I said no. &quot;O.K. Let's
get this over with. We'll put what we need in the car. We'll stop at the
Courville Bar before we hit the airport.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I didn't get

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I got it.
&quot;O.K. I'm dumb, at times. Let's go.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>We loaded the
machine into the car, and the bar, left the studio keys at the corner grocery
for the real estate com­pany, and headed for the airport by way of the
Courville Bar. Ruth was in California, but Joe had champagne. We got to the
airport late.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Marrs met us
in Los Angeles. &quot;What's up? You've got Johnson running around in
circles.&quot;</p>

tell you why?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Sounds

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>In Johnson's

you expect to find someone to lip-read in Chinese? Or Russian, for that
matter?&quot;</p>

down. &quot;What have you got so far?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Besides

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I scanned it.
&quot;How long before you can get them here?&quot; An explosion. &quot;How long
before I can get them here? Am I your errand boy?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;For all
practical purposes you are. Quit the fooling. How about it?&quot; Marrs
snickered at the look on Johnson's face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What
are you smirking at, you moron?&quot; Marrs gave in and laughed outright, and I
did, too. &quot;Go ahead and laugh. This isn't funny. When I called the State

skip that.</p>

Deaf. That's the best I could do.' We thought that over. &quot;Get on the
phone. Talk to even state in the union if you have to, or overseas.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Johnson

lucky?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You'll
find out. Get them on planes and fly them here, and we'll talk turkey when they
get here. I want a projection room, not yours, and a good bonded court
reporter.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Johnson never
did find anyone who could lipread Greek. None, at least, that could speak
English. The expert on Rus­sian he dug out of Ambridge, in Pennsylvania, the
Flemish and Holland Dutch expert came from Leyden, in the Netherlands, and at
the last minute he stumbled upon a Korean who worked in Seattle as an inspector
for the Chinese Government. Five women and two men. We signed them to an
ironclad contract drawn by Samuels, who now handled all our legal work. I made
a little speech before they signed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;These
contracts, as far as we've been able to make sure, are going to control your
personal and business life for the next year, and there's a clause that says we
can extend that period for another year if we so desire. Let's get this
straight. You are to live in a place of your own, which we will provide. You
will be supplied with all necessities by our buyers. Any attempt at
unauthorized communication will result in abrogation of the contract. Is that
clear?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Good.
Your work will not be difficult, but it will be tre­mendously important. You
will, very likely, be finished in three months, but you will be ready to go any
place at any time at our discretion, naturally at our expense. Mr. Sorenson, as
you are taking this down, you realize that this goes for you, too.&quot; He nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Your

Johnson bought for us a small rooming house, and we paid an exorbitant price to
a detective agency to do the cooking and cleaning and chauffering required. We
requested that the lipreaders refrain from discussing their work among

instructions very well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>One day,
about a month later, we called a conference in the projection room of Johnson's

&quot;One more thing, before we go any further read this. It's a certified and
notarized transcript of what has been read from the lips of the characters you
just saw. They weren't, incidentally, 'characters,' in that sense of the
word.&quot; I handed the crackling sheets around, a copy for each. &quot;Those
'characters' are real people. You've just seen a newsreel. This transcript will
tell you what they were talk­ing about. Read it. In the trunk of the car Mike
and I have something to show you. We'll be back by the time you've read
it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Mike helped
me carry in the machine from the car. We came in the door in time to see
Kessler throw the transcript as far as he could. He bounced to his feet as the
sheets fluttered down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>He was
furious. &quot;What's going on here?&quot; We paid no at­tention to him, nor to
the excited demands of the others until the machine had been plugged into the
nearest outlet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Mike looked
at me. &quot;Any ideas?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I shook my
head and told Johnson to shut up for a minute. Mike lifted the lid and
hesitated momentarily before he touched the dials. I pushed Johnson into his
chair and turned off the lights myself. The room went black. Johnson, looking
over my shoulder, gasped. I heard Bernstein swear softly, amazed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I turned to
see what Mike had shown them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>It was
impressive, all right. He had started just over the roof of the laboratory and
continued straight up in the air. Up, up, up, until the city of Los Angeles was
a tiny dot on a great ball. On the horizon were the Rockies. Johnson grabbed my
arm. He hurt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What's
that? What's that? Stop it!&quot; He was yelling. Mike turned off the machine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>You can guess
what happened next. No one believed their eyes, nor Mike's patient explanation.
He had to twice turn on the machine again, once going far back into Kessler's
past. Then the reaction set in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Marrs smoked
one cigarette after another, Bernstein turned a gold pencil over and over in
his nervous fingers, Johnson paced like a caged tiger, and burly Kessler stared
at the machine, saying nothing at all. Johnson was muttering as he paced. Then
he stopped and shook his fist under Mike's nose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Man! Do
you know what you've got there? Why waste time playing around here? Can't you
see you've got the world by the tail on a downhill pull? If I'd ever known
this&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Mike appealed
to me. &quot;Ed, talk to this wildman.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I did. I
can't remember exactly what I said, and it isn't important. But I did tell him
how we'd started, how we'd plotted our course, and what we were going to do. I
ended by telling him the idea behind the reel of film I'd run off a minute
before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>He recoiled
as though I were a snake. &quot;You can't get away with that! You'd be hungif
you weren't lynched first!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Don't
you think we know that? Don't you think we're willing to take that
chance?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>He tore his
thinning hair. Marrs broke in. &quot;Let me talk to him.&quot; He came over and
faced us squarely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Is this
on the level? You going to make a picture like that and stick your neck out?
You're going to turn that . . . that thing over to the people of the
world?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I nodded.
&quot;Just that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;And
toss over everything you've got?&quot; He was dead seri­ous, and so was I. He
turned to the others. &quot;He means it!&quot; Bernstein said, &quot;Can't be
done!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Words flew. I
tried to convince them that we had fol­lowed the only possible path. &quot;What
kind of a world do you want to live in? Or don't you want to live?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Johnson
grunted. &quot;How long do you think we'd live if we ever made a picture like
that? You're crazy! I'm not. I'm not going to put my head in a noose.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Why do
you think we've been so insistent about credit and responsibility for direction
and production? You'll be doing only what we hired you for. Not that we want to
twist your arm, but you've made a fortune, all of you, working for us. Now,
when the going gets heavy, you want to back out!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Marrs gave
in. &quot;Maybe you're right, maybe you're wrong. Maybe you're crazy, maybe I
am. I always used to say I'd try anything once. Bernie, you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Bernstein was
quietly cynical. &quot;You saw what happened in the last war. This might help.
I don't know if it will. I don't knowbut I'd hate to think I didn't try. Count
me in!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Kessler?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>He swiveled
his head. &quot;Kid stuff! Who wants to live forever? Who wants to let a chance
go by?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Johnson threw
up his hands. &quot;Let's hope we get a cell to­gether. Let's all go
crazy.&quot; And that was that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>We went to
work in a blazing drive of mutual hope and understanding. In four months the
lipreaders were through. There's no point in detailing here their reactions to
the dynamite they daily dictated to Sorenson. For their own good we kept them
in the dark about our final purpose, and when they were through we sent them
across the border into Mex­ico, to a small ranch Johnson had leased. We were
going to need them later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>While the
print duplicators worked overtime Marrs worked harder. The press and the radio
shouted the announcement that, in every city of the world we could reach, there
would be held the simultaneous premieres of our latest picture. It would be the
last we needed to make. Many wondered aloud at our choice of the word
&quot;needed.&quot; We whetted curiosity by refusing any advance information
about the plot, and Johnson so well infused the men with their own now-fervent
en­thusiasm that not much could be pried out of them but con­jecture. The day
we picked for release was Sunday. Monday, the storm broke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I wonder how
many prints of that picture are left today. I wonder how many escaped burning
or confiscation. Two World Wars we covered, covered from the unflattering
angles that, up until then, had been represented by only a few books hidden in
the dark corners of libraries. We showed and named the warmakers, the cynical
ones who signed and laughed and lied, the blatant patriots who used the flare
of headlines and the ugliness of atrocity to hide behind their flag while life
turned to death for millions. Our own and foreign traitors were there, the
hidden ones with Janus faces. Our lipreaders had done their work well; no guesses
these, no deduced conjectures from the broken records of a blasted past, but
the exact words that exposed treachery disguised as patriotism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>In foreign
lands the performances lasted barely the day. Usually, in retaliation for the
imposed censorship, the thea­ters were wrecked by the raging crowds. (Marrs,
incidentally, had spent hundreds of thousands bribing officials to allow the
picture to be shown without previous censorship. Many censors, when that came
out, were shot without trial). In the Balkans, revolutions broke out, and
various embassies were stormed by mobs. Where the film was banned or destroyed
written versions spontaneously appeared on the streets or in coffeehouses.
Bootlegged editions were smuggled past cus­toms guards, who looked the other
way. One royal family fled to Switzerland.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Here in
America it was a racing two weeks before the Federal Government, prodded into
action by the raging of press and radio, in an unprecedented move closed all
per­formances &quot;to promote the common welfare, insure domestic
tranquillity, and preserve foreign relations.&quot; Murmursand one
riotrumbled in the Midwest and spread until it was realized by the powers that
be that something had to be done, and done quickly, if every government in the
world were not to collapse of its own weight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>We were in
Mexico, at the ranch Johnson had rented for the lipreaders. While Johnson paced
the floor, jerkily fraying a cigar, we listened to a special broadcast of the
attorney gen­eral himself:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>
furthermore, this message was today forwarded to the Government of the United
States of Mexico. I read: `the Government of the United States of America
requests the immediate arrest and extradition of the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;'Edward
Joseph Leftkowicz, known as Lefko.' &quot; First on the list. Even a fish
wouldn't get into trouble if he kept his mouth shut.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;'Miguel
Jose Zapata Laviada.' &quot; Mike crossed one leg over the other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;
'Edward Lee Johnson: &quot; He threw his cigar on the floor and sank into a
chair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;'Robert
Chester Marrs.'&quot; &quot; He lit another cigarette. His face twitched.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;
Benjamin Lionel Bernstein.' &quot; He smiled a twisted smile and closed his
eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;'Carl
Wilhelm Kessler.' &quot; A snarl.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;These
men are wanted by the Government of the United States of America, to stand trial
on charges ranging from criminal syndicalism, incitement to riot, suspicion of
trea­son&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I clicked off
the radio. &quot;Well?,&quot; to no one in particular.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Bernstein
opened his eyes. &quot;The rurales are probably on their way. Might as well go
back and face the music&quot; We crossed the border at Juarez. The FBI was
waiting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Every press
and radio chain in the world must have had coverage at that trial, every radio
system, even the new and imperfect television chain. We were allowed to see no
one but our lawyer. Samuels flew from the West Coast and spent a week trying to
get past our guards. He told us not to talk to reporters, if we ever saw them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You
haven't seen the newspapers? Just as wellHow did you ever get yourselves into
this mess, anyway? You ought to know better.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I told him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>He was
stunned. &quot;Are you all crazy?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>He was hard
to convince. Only the united effort and con­certed stories of all of us made
him believe that there was such a machine in existence. (He talked to us
separately, because we were kept isolated). When he got back to me he was
unable to think coherently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What
kind of defense do you call that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I shook my
head. &quot;No. That is, we know that we're guilty of practically everything
under the sun if you look at it one way. If you look at it another&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>He rose.
&quot;Man, you don't need a lawyer, you need a doctor. I'll see you later. I've
got to get this figured out in my mind before I can do a thing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Sit
down. What do you think of this?&quot; and I outlined what I had in mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I think
... I don't know what I think. I don't know. I'll talk to you later. Right now
I want some fresh air,&quot; and he left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>As most
trials do, this one began with the usual blackening of the defendant's
character, or lack of it. (The men we blackmailed at the beginning had long
since had their money returned, and they had sense enough to keep quiet. That
might have been because they'd received a few hints that there might still be a
negative or two lying around. Compounding a felony? Sure). With the greatest of
interest we sat in that great columned hall and listened to a sad tale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>We had, with
malice aforethought, libeled beyond repair great and unselfish men who had made
a career of devotion to the public weal, imperiled needlessly relations
traditional]; friendly by falsely reporting mythical events, mocked the
courageous sacrifices of those who had duke et gloria mori and completely upset
everyone's peace of mind. Every new accusation, every verbal lance drew solemn
agreement from the dignitary-packed hall. Against someone's better judgment the
trial had been transferred from the regular courtroom to the Hall of Justice.
Packed with influence, brass, and pompous legates from all over the world, only
the congressmen from the biggest states, or with the biggest votes were able to
crowd the newly installed seats. So you can see it was a hostile audience that
faced Samuels when the defense had its say. We had spent the previous night
together in the guarded suite to which we had been transferred for the duration
of the trial, perfecting, as far as we could, our planned defense. Samuels has
the arrogant sense of humor that usually goes with supreme self-confidence, and
I'm sure he enjoyed stand­ing there among all those bemedaled and bejowled
bigwigs, knowing the bombshell he was going to hurl. He made a good grenadier.
Like this:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We
believe there is only one defense possible, we believe there is only one
defense necessary. We have gladly waived, without prejudice, our inalienable
right of trial by jury. We shall speak plainly and bluntly, to the point.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You
have seen the picture in question. You have remarked, possibly, upon what has
been called the startling resemblance of the actors in that picture to the
characters named and portrayed. You have remarked, possibly, upon the apparent
verisimilitude to reality. That I will mention again. The first witness will, I
believe, establish the trend of our rebuttal of the allegations of the
prosecution.&quot; He called the first witness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Your
name, please?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Mercedes
Maria Gomez.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;A
little louder, please.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Mercedes
Maria Gomez.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Your
occupation?'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Until
last March I was a teacher at the Arizona School for the Deaf. Then I asked for
and obtained a leave of absence. At present I am under personal contract to Mr.
Lefko.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;If you
see Mr. Lefko in this courtroom, Miss . . . Mrs.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Miss.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Thank
you. If Mr. Lefko is in this court will you point him out? Thank you. Will you
tell us the extent of your duties at the Arizona School?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I
taught children born totally deaf to speak. And to read lips.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You read
lips yourself, Miss Gomez?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I have
been totally deaf since I was fifteen.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;In
English only?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;English
and Spanish. We have . . . had many children of Mexican descent.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Samuels asked
for a designated Spanish-speaking interpre­ter. An officer in the back
immediately volunteered. He was identified by his ambassador, who was present.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Will
you take this book to the rear of the courtroom, sir?&quot; To the Court:
&quot;If the prosecution wishes to examine that book, they will find that it is
a Spanish edition of the Bible.&quot; The prosecution didn't wish to examine
it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Will
the officer open the Bible at random and read aloud?&quot; He opened the Bible
at the center and read. In dead silence the Court strained to hear. Nothing
could be heard the length of the enormous hall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Samuels:
&quot;Miss Gomez. Will you take these binoculars and repeat, to the Court, just
what the officer is reading at the other end of the room?'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>She took the
binoculars and focused them expertly on the officer, who had stopped reading
and was watching alertly. &quot;I am ready.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Samuels:
&quot;Will you please read, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>He did, and
the Gomez woman repeated aloud, quickly and easily, a section that sounded as
though it might be anything at all. I can't speak Spanish. The officer
continued to read for a minute or two.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Samuls:
&quot;Thank you, sir. And thank you, Miss Gomez. Your pardon, sir, but since
there are several who have been known to memorize the Bible, will you tell the
Court if you have anything on your person that is written, anything that Miss
Gomez has no chance of viewing?&quot; Yes, the officer had &quot;Will you read
that as before? Will you, Miss Gomez&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>She read
that, too. Then the officer came to the front to listen to the court reporter
read Miss Gomez' words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That's
what I read,&quot; he affirmed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Samuels
turned her over to the prosecution, who made more experiments that served only
to convince that she was equally good as an interpreter and lipreader in either
language.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>In rapid
succession Samuels put the rest of the lipreaders on the stand. In rapid
succession they proved themselves as able and as capable as Miss Gomez, in
their own linguistic specialty. The Russian from Ambridge generously offered to
translate into his broken English any other Slavic language handy, and drew
scattered grins from the press box. The Court was convinced, but failed to see
the purpose of the ex­hibition. Samuels, glowing with satisfaction and
confidence, faced the Court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Thanks
to the indulgence of the Court, and despite the efforts of the distinguished
prosecution, we have proved the almost amazing accuracy of lipreading in
general, and these lipreaders in particular.&quot; One Justice absently nodded
in agreement. 'Therefore, our defense will he based on that premise, and on one
other which we have had until now found necessary to keep hiddenthe picture in
question was and is definitely not a fictional representation of events of
questionable authenticity. Every scene in that film contained, not polished
professional actors, but the original person named and portrayed. Every foot,
every inch of film was not the result of an elaborate studio reconstruction but
an actual col­lection of pictures, an actual collection of newsreelsif they
can be called thatedited and assembled in story form!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Through the
startled spurt of astonishment we heard one of the prosecution: &quot;That's
ridiculous! No newsreel&quot; Samuels ignored the objections and the tumult to
put me on the stand. Beyond the usual preliminary questions I was allowed to
say, things my own way. At first hostile, the Court became interested enough to
overrule the repeated objections that flew from the table devoted to the
prosecution. I felt that at least two of the Court, if not outright favorable,
were friendly. As far as I can remember, I went over the maneuvers of the past
years, and ended something like this:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;As to
why we arranged the cards to fall as they did; both Mr. Laviada and myself were
unable to face the prospect of destroying his discovery, because of the
inevitable penalizing of needed research. We were, and we are, unwilling to better
ourselves or a limited group by the use and maintenance of secrecy, if secrecy
were possible. As to the only other alternative,&quot; and I directed this
straight at Judge Bronson, the well-known liberal on the bench, &quot;since the
last war all atomic research and activity has been under the direction of a
Board nominally civilian, but actually under the `protection and di­rection' of
the Army and Navy. This 'direction and protec­tion,' as any competent physicist
will gladly attest, has proved to be nothing but a smothering blanket serving
to conceal hide-bound antiquated reasoning, abysmal ignorance, and inestimable
amounts of fumbling. As of right now, this coun­try, or any country that was
foolish enough to place any con­fidence in the rigid regime of the military
mind, is years behind what would otherwise be the natural course of discovery
and progress in nuclear and related fields.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We
were, and we are, firmly convinced that even the slightest hint of the inherent
possibilities and scope of Mr. Laviada's discovery would have meant, under the
present regime, instant and mandatory confiscation of even a sup­posedly secure
patent. Mr. Laviada has never applied for a patent, and never will. We both
feel that such a discovery belongs not to an individual, a group, a
corporation, or even to a nation, but to the world and those who live in it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We
know, and are eager and willing to prove, that the domestic and external
affairs of not only this nation, but of every nation are influenced, sometimes
controlled, by esoteric groups warping political theories and human lives to
suit their own ends.&quot; The Court was smothered in sullen silence, thick and
acid with hate and disbelief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Secret
treaties, for example, and vicious, lying propa­ganda have too long controlled
human passions and made men hate; honored thieves have too long rotted secretly
in undeserved high places. The machine can make treachery and untruth
impossible. It must, if atomic war is not to sear the face and fate of the
world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Our
pictures were all made with that end in view. We needed, first, the wealth and
prominence to present to an in­ternational audience what we knew to be the
truth. We have done as much as we can. From now on, this Court takes over the
burden we have carried. We are guilty of no treach­ery, guilty of no deceit,
guilty of nothing but deep and true humanity. Mr. Laviada wishes me to tell the
Court and the world that he has been unable till now to give his discovery to
the world, free to use as it wills.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>The Court
stared at me. Every foreign representative was on the edge of his seat waiting
for the Justices to order us shot without further ado, the sparkling uniforms
were seeth­ing, and the pressmen were racing their pencils against time. The
tension dried my throat. The speech that Samuels and I had rehearsed the
previous night was strong medicine. Now what?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Samuels
filled the breach smoothly. &quot;If the Court pleases; Mr. Lefko has made some
startling statements. Startling, but certainly sincere, and certainly either
provable or disprovable. And proof it shall be!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>He strode to
the door of the conference room that had been allotted us. As the hundreds of
eyes followed him it was easy for me to slip down from the witness stand, and
wait, ready. From the conference room Samuels rolled the machine, and Mike
rose. The whispers that curdled the air seemed dis­appointed, unimpressed.
Right in front of the Bench he trundled it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>He moved
unobtrusively to one side as the television men trained their long-snouted
cameras. &quot;Mr. Laviada and Mr. Lefko will show you . . . I trust there will
be no objection from the prosecution?&quot; He was daring them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>One of the
prosecution was already on his feet. He opened his mouth hesitantly, but
thought better, and sat down. Heads went together in conference as he did.
Samuels was watching the Court with one eye, and the court room with the other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;If the
Court pleases, we will need a cleared space. If the bailiff will . . . thank
you, sir.&quot; The long tables were moved back, with a raw scraping. He stood
there, with every eye in the courtroom glued on him. For two long breaths he
stood there, then be spun and went to his table. &quot;Mr. Lefko,&quot; and he
bowed formally. He sat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>The eyes
swung to me, to Mike, as he moved to his machine and stood there silently. I
cleared my throat and spoke to the Bench as though I did not see the
directional microphones trained at my lips.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Justice
Bronson.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>He looked
steadily at me and then glanced at Mike. &quot;Yes, Mr. Lefko?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Your
freedom from bias is well known.&quot; The corners of his mouth went down as he
frowned. &quot;Will you be willing to be used as proof that there can be no
trickery?&quot; He thought that over, then nodded slowly. The prosecution
objected, and was waved down. &quot;Will you tell me exactly where you were at
any give time? Any place where you are absolutely cer­tain and can verify that
there were no concealed cameras or observers?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>He thought.
Seconds. Minutes. The tension twanged, and I swallowed dust. He spoke quietly.
&quot;1918. November 11th.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Mike
whispered to me. I said, &quot;Any particular time?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Justice
Bronson looked at Mike. &quot;Exactly eleven. Armistice time.&quot; He paused,
then went on. &quot;Niagara Falls. Niagara Falls, New York.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>I heard the
dials tick in the stillness, and Mike whispered again. I said, &quot;The lights
should be off.&quot; The bailiff rose. &quot;Will you please watch the left
wall, or in that direction? I think that if Justice Kassel will turn a little .
. . we are ready.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Bronson
looked at me, and at the left wall. &quot;Ready.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>The lights
flicked out overhead and I heard the television crews mutter. I touched Mike on
the shoulder. &quot;Show them, Mike!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>We're all
showmen at heart, and Mike is no exception. Suddenly out of nowhere and into
the depths poured a frozen torrent. Niagara Falls. I've mentioned, I think,
that I've never got over my fear of heights. Few people ever do. I heard long,
shuddery gasps as we started straight down. Down, until we stopped at the brink
of the silent cataract, weird on its frozen majesty. Mike had stopped time at
exactly eleven, I knew. He shifted to the American bank. Slowly he moved along.
There were a few tourists standing in almost comic attitudes. There was snow on
the ground, flakes in the air. Time stood still, and hearts slowed in sympathy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Bronson
snapped, &quot;Stop!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>A couple,
young. Long skirts, high-buttoned army collar, dragging army overcoat, facing,
arms about each other. Mike's sleeve rustled in the darkness and they moved.
She was sobbing and the soldier was smiling. She turned away her head, and he
turned it back. Another couple seized them gayly, and they twirled
breathlessly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Bronson's
voice was harsh. &quot;That's enough!&quot; The view blurred for seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Washington.
The White House. The President. Someone coughed like a small explosion. The
President was watching a television screen. He jerked erect suddenly, startled.
Mike spoke for the first time in court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That is
the President of the United States. He is watching the trial that is being
broadcast and televised from this courtroom. He is listening to what I am
saying right now, and he is watching, in his television screen, as I use my
machine to show him what he was doing one second ago.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>The President
heard those fateful words. Stiffly he threw an unconscious glance around his
room at nothing and looked hack at his screen in time to see himself do what he
just had done, one second ago. Slowly, as if against his will, his hand started
toward the switch of his set.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Mr.
President, don't turn off that set.&quot; Mike's voice was curt, almost rude.
&quot;You must hear this, you of all people in the world. You must understand!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;This is
not what we wanted to do, but we have no recourse left but to appeal to you,
and to the people of this twisted world.&quot; The President might have been
cast in iron. &quot;You must see, you must understand that you have in your
hands the power to make it impossible for greed-born war to be bred in secrecy
and rob man of his youth or his old age or whatever he prizes.&quot; His voice
softened, pleaded. &quot;That is all we have to say. That is all we want. This
is all anyone could want, ever.&quot; The President, unmoving, faded into black­ness.
&quot;The lights, please,&quot; and almost immediately the Court adjourned.
That was over a month ago.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Mike's
machine has been taken from us, and we are under military guard. Probably it's
just as well we're guarded. We understand there have been lynching parties,
broken up only as far as a block or two away. Last week we watched a
white-haired fanatic scream about us, on the street below. We couldn't catch
what he was shrieking, but we did catch a few airborne epithets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Devils!
Anti-Christs! Violation of the Bible! Violations of this and that!&quot; Some,
right here in the city, I suppose, would be glad to build a bonfire to cook us
right back to the flames from which we've sprung. I wonder what the various
religious groups are going to do now that the truth can be seen. Who can read
lips in Aramaic, or Latin, or Coptic? And is a me­chanical miracle a miracle?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>This changes
everything. We've been moved. Where, I don't know, except that the weather is
warm, and we're on some military reservation, by the lack of civilians. Now we
know what we're up against. What started out to be just a time-killing
occupation, Joe, has turned out to be a necessary preface to what I'm going to
ask you to do. Finish this, and then move fast! We won't be able to get this to
you for a while yet, so Ill go on for a bit the way I started, to kill time.

Almost unanimously the press screamed; Pegler frothed, Winchell leered. We got
the surface side of the situation from the press. But a military guard is
composed of individuals, hotel rooms must be swept by maids, waiters must serve
food, and a chain is as strong We got what we think the truth from those who
work for a living.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>There are meetings
on street corners and homes, two great veterans' groups have arbitrarily fired
their officials, seven governors have resigned, three senators and over a dozen
representatives have retired with &quot;ill health,&quot; and the general
temper is ugly. International travelers report the same of Europe, Asia is
bubbling, and transport planes with motors running stud the airports of South
America. A general whis­per is that a Constitutional Amendment is being rammed
through to forbid the use of any similar instrument by any individual, with the
manufacture and leasing by the Federal government to law-enforcement agencies
or financially-responsible corporations suggested; it is whispered that motor
caravans are forming throughout the country for a Washington march to demand a
decision by the Court on the truth of our charges; it is generally suspected
that all news dis­seminating services are under direct FederalArmy control;
wires are supposed to be sizzling with petitions and demands to Congress, which
are seldom delivered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>One day the
chambermaid said: &quot;And the whole hotel might as well close up shop. The
whole floor is blocked off, there're MP's at every door, and they're clearing
out all the other guests as fast as they can be moved. The whole place wouldn't
be big enough to hold the letters and wires addressed to you, or the ones that
are trying to get in to see you. Fat chance they have,&quot; she added grimly.
&quot;The joint is lousy with brass.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Mike glanced
at me and I cleared my throat. &quot;What's your idea of the whole thing?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Expertly she
spanked and reversed a pillow. &quot;I saw your last picture before they shut
it down. I saw all your pictures. When I wasn't working I listened to your
trial. I heard you tell them off. I never got married because my boy friend
never came back from Burma. Ask him what he thinks,&quot; and she jerked her
head at the young private that was supposed to keep her from talking. &quot;Ask
him if he wants some bunch of stinkers to start him shooting at some other poor
chump. See what he says, and then ask me if I want an atom bomb dropped down my
neck just because some chiselers want more than they got.&quot; She left
suddenly, and the soldier left with her. Mike and I had a beer and went to bed.

But, communi­cate?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-75.3pt;text-indent:.25in'>Look at it
this way. A soldier is a soldier because he wants to serve his country. A
soldier doesn't want to die unless his country is at war. Even then death is
only a last resort. And war isn't necessary any more, not with our machine. In

self-defense. If every nation, or if every man, had a machine, each would be
equally open, or equally protected. But if only one na­tion, or only one man
can see, the rest will not long be blind. Maybe we did this all wrong. God
knows that we thought about it often. God knows we did our best to make an
effort at keeping man out of his own trap.</p>

capable of following the plans we've enclosed.</p>

got to hurry! One of these bright days someone is going to wonder if we've made
more than one machine. We haven't, of course. That would have been foolish. But
if some smart young lieutenant gets hold of that machine long enough to start
tracing back our movements they'll find that safety deposit box, with the plans
and letters ready to be scattered broadside. You can see the need for hasteif
the rest of the world, or any particular nation, wants that machine bad enough,
they'll fight for it. And they will! They must? Later on, when the Army gets
used to the machine and its capabilities, it will become obvious to everyone,
as it already has to Mike and me, that, with every plan open to in­spection as
soon as it's made, no nation or group of nations would have a chance in open
warfare. So if there is to be an attack, it will have to be deadly, and fast,
and sure. Please God that we haven't shoved the world into a war we tried to
make impossible. With all the atom bombs and rockets that have been made in the
past few yearsJoe, you've got to hurry!</p>

foot on the new territory, and then the other. That made him the first of his
kind on an unknown world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He posed there in the sunlight, a
big bull of a man me­ticulously attired for the occasion. Not a spot marred his
faultlessly cut uniform of gray-green on which jeweled orders of merit sparkled
and flashed. His jack boots glistened as they had never done since the day of
launching from the home planet. The golden bells of his rank tinkled on his
heel-hooks as he shifted his feet slightly. In the deep shadow be­neath the
visor of his ornate helmet his hard eyes held a glow of self-satisfaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>A microphone came swinging down to
him from the air lock he'd just left. Taking it in a huge left hand, he looked

as any there had been in his world's history.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;In the name of Huld and the
people of Huld,&quot; he enunci­ated officiously, &quot;I take this
planet.&quot; Then he saluted swiftly, slickly, like an automaton.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Facing him, twenty-two long, black
spaceships simultane­ously thrust from their forward ports their glorypoles
ringed with the red-black-gold colors of Huld. Inside the vessels twenty-two
crews of seventy men apiece stood rigidly erect, saluted, broke into well
drilled song, &quot;Oh, heavenly fatherland of Huld.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>When they had finished, Commander
Cruin saluted again. The crews repeated their salute. The glorypoles were drawn
in. Cruin mounted the ladder, enterd his flagship. All locks were closed. Along
the valley the twenty-two invaders lay in military formation, spaced
equidistantly, noses and tails dead in line.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Reaching his cabin, Commander
Cruin lowered his bulk into the seat behind his desk, took off his heavy
helmet, ad­justed an order of merit which was hiding modestly behind its
neighbor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Step four,&quot; he
commented with satisfaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Second Commander Jusik nodded
respectfully. He handed the other a book. Opening it, Cruin meditated aloud.
&quot;Step one: Check planet's certain suitability for our form</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>of life.&quot; He rubbed his big
jowls. &quot;We know it's suitable.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes, sir. This is a great
triumph for you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>'&quot;Thank you, Jusik.&quot; A
craggy smile played momentarily on one side of Cruin's broad face. &quot;Step
two: Remain in planetary shadow at distance of not less than one diameter while
scout boats survey world for evidence of superior life forms. Three: Select
landing place far from largest sources of possible resistance but adjacent to a
source small enough to be mastered. Four: Declare Huld's claim ceremoniously,
as prescribed in manual on procedure and discipline.&quot; He worked his jowls
again. &quot;We've done all that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The smile returned, and he glanced
with satisfaction out of the small port near his chair. The port framed the
smoke column on the hill. His expression changed to a scowl, and his jaw
muscles lumped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Fully trained and completely
qualified,&quot; he growled sar­donically. &quot;Yet he had to smash up.
Another ship and crew lost in the very moment we reach our goal. The eighth
such loss. There will be a purge in the astronautical training center when I
return.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; approved
Jusik, dutifully. &quot;There's no excuse for it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;There are no excuses for
anything,&quot; Cruin retorted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Snorting his contempt, Cruin
looked at his book. &quot;Step five: Make all protective preparations as
detailed in defense manual.&quot; He glanced up into Jusik's lean, clearcut
features. &quot;Every captain has been issued with a defense manual. Are they
carrying out its orders?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes, sir. They have started
already.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;They better had! I shall
arrange a demotion of the slowest.&quot; Wetting a large thumb, he flipped a
page over. &quot;Step ,six: If planet does hold life forms of suspected
intelligence, obtain specimens.&quot; Lying back in his seat he mused a mo­ment,
then barked: &quot;Well, for what are you waiting?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I beg your pardon,
sir?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Get some examples,&quot;
roared Cruin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Very well, sir.&quot;
Without blinking, Jusik saluted, marched out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The self-closer swung the door
behind him. Cruin sur­veyed it with a jaundiced eye.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Curse the training
center,&quot; he rumbled. &quot;It has deteriorat­ed since I was there.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Putting his feet on the desk, he
waggled his heels to make the bells tinkle while he waited for the examples.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Three specimens turned up of their
own accord. They were seen standing wide-eyed in a row near the prow of number
twenty-two, the endmost ship of the line. Captain Somir brought them along
personally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Step six calls for
specimens, sir,&quot; he explained to Com­mander Cruin. &quot;I know that you
require ones better than these, but I found these under our nose.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Under your nose? You land and
within short time other life forms are sightseeing around your vessel? What
about your protective precautions?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;They are not completed yet,
sir. They take some time.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What were your lookouts
doingsleeping?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No, sir,&quot; assured Somir
desperately. &quot;They did not think it necessary to sound a general alarm for
such as these.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Reluctantly, Cruin granted the
point. His gaze ran con­temptuously over the trio. Three kids. One was a boy,
knee-high, snubnosed, chewing at a chubby fist. The next, a skinny-legged,
pigtailed girl obviously older than the boy. The third was another girl almost
as tall as Somir, somewhat skinny, but with a hint of coming shapeliness hiding
in her thin attire. All three were freckled, all had violently red hair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The tall girl said to Cruin:
&quot;I'm MarvaMarva Meredith.&quot; She indicated her companions. &quot;This
is Sue and this is Sam.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>We live over there, in
Williamsville.&quot; She smiled at him and suddenly he noticed that her eyes
were a rich and startling green. &quot;We were looking for blueberries when we
saw you come down.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Cruin grunted, rested his hands on
his paunch. The fact that this planet's life manifestly was of his own shape
and form impressed him not at all. It had never occurred to him that it could
have proved otherwise. In Huldian thought, all superior life must be humanoid
and no exploration had yet provided evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I don't understand her alien
gabble and she doesn't un­derstand Huldian,&quot; he complained to Somir.
&quot;She must be dull-witted to waste her breath thus.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; agreed
Somir. &quot;Do you wish me to hand them over to the tutors?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No. They're not worth
it.&quot; He eyed the small boy's freck­les with distaste, never having seen
such a phenomenon before. &quot;They are badly spotted and may be diseased.
Pfaugh!&quot; He grimaced with disgust. &quot;Did they pass through the
ray-sterilizing chamber as they came in?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Certainly, sir. I was most
careful about that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Be equally careful about any
more you may encounter.&quot; Slowly, his authoritative stare went from the boy
to the pig-tailed girl and finally to the tall one. He didn't want to look at
her, yet knew that he was going to. Her cool green eyes held something that
made him vaguely uncomfortable. Un­willingly he met those eyes. She smiled
again, with little dimples. &quot;Kick 'em out!&quot; he rapped at Somir.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;As you order, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Nudging them, Somir gestured
toward the door. The three took hold of each other's hands, filed out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Bye!&quot; chirped the boy,
solemnly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Bye!&quot; said pigtails,
shyly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The tall girl turned in the
doorway. &quot;Good-by!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Gazing at her uncomprehendingly,
Cruin fidgeted in his chair. She dimpled at him, then the door swung to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Good-by.&quot; He mouthed
the strange word to himself. Con­sidering the circumstances in which it had
been uttered, evi­dently it meant farewell. Already he had picked up one word
of their language.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Step seven: Gain
communication by tutoring specimens until they are proficient in Huldian.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Teach them. Do not let them teach
youteach them. The slaves must learn from the masters, not the masters from
the slaves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Good-by.&quot; He repeated
it with savage self-accusation. A minor matter, but still an infringement of
the book of rules. There are no excuses for anything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Teach them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The slaves</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Rockets rumbled and blasted
deafeningly as ships maneu­vered themselves into the positions laid down in the
manual of defense. Several hours of careful belly-edging were re­quired for
this. In the end, the line had reshaped itself into two more groups of
eleven-pointed stars, noses at the centers, tails outward. Ash of blast-destroyed
grasses, shrubs and trees covered a wide area beyond the two menacing rings of
main propulsion tubes which could incinerate anything within one mile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>This done, perspiring, dirt-coated
crews lugged out their forward armaments, remounted them pointing outward in
the spaces between the vessels' splayed tails. Rear armaments still aboard
already were directed upward and outward. Arm­aments plus tubes now provided a
formidable field of fire completely surrounding the double encampment. It was
the Huldian master plan conceived by Huldian master planners. In other more
alien estimation, it was the old covered-wagon technique, so incredibly ancient
that it had been forgotten by all but most earnest students of the past. But
none of the invaders knew that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Around the perimeter they staked
the small, fast, well-armed scouts of which there were two per ship. Noses
outward, tails inward, in readiness for quick take-off, they were paired just
beyond the parent vessels, below the propulsion tubes, and out of line of the
remounted batteries. There was a lot of moving around to get the scouts
positioned at precisely the same distances apart and making precisely the same
angles. The whole arrangement had that geometrical exactness beloved of the
military mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Pacing the narrow catwalk running
along the top surface of his flagship, Commander Cruin observed his toiling
crews with satisfaction. Organization, discipline, energy, unques­tioning
obediencethose were the prime essentials of effi­ciency. On such had Huld
grown great. On such would Huld grow greater.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Reaching the tail-end, he leaned
on the stop-rail, gazed down upon the concentric rings of wide, stubby
venturis. His own crew were checking the angles of their two scouts already
positioned. Four guards, heavily armed, came marching through the ash with
Jusik in the lead. They had six prisoners.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Seeing him, Jusik bawled:
&quot;Halt!&quot; Guard and guarded stopped with a thud of boots and a raise of
dust. Looking up, Jusik saluted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Six specimens, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Cruin eyed them indifferently.
Half a dozen middle-aged men in drab, sloppily fitting clothes. He would not
have given a snap of the fingers for six thousand of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The biggest of the captives, the
one second from the left, had red hair and was sucking something that gave off
smoke. His shoulders were wider than Cruin's own though he didn't look half the
weight. Idly, the commander wondered whether the fellow had green eyes; he
couldn't tell that from where he was standing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Calmly surveying Cruin, this
prisoner took the smoke-thing from his mouth and said, tonelessly: &quot;By
hokey, a brasshat!&quot; Then he shoved the thing back between his lips and
dribbled blue vapor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The others looked doubtful, as if
either they did not com­prehend or found it past belief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Jeepers, no!&quot; said the
one on the right, a gaunt individual with thin, saturnine features.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I'm telling you,&quot;
assured Redhead in the same flat voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Shall I take them to the
tutors, sir?&quot; asked Jusik.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes.&quot;' Unleaning from
the rail, Cruin carefully adjusted his white gloves. &quot;Don't bother me with
them again until they are certified as competent to talk.&quot; Answering the
other's salute, he paraded back along the catwalk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Seer' said Redhead, picking
up his feet in time with the guard. He seemed to take an obscure pleasure in
keeping in step with the guard. Winking at the nearest prisoner, he let a curl
of aromatic smoke trickle from the side of his mouth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Tutors Fane and Parth sought an
interview the following evening. Jusik ushered them in, and Cruin looked up
irritably from the report he was writing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Well?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Fane said: &quot;Sir, these
prisoners suggest that we share their homes for a while and teach them to
converse there.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;How did they suggest
that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Mostly by signs,&quot;
explained Fane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;And what made you think that
so nonsensical a plan had sufficient merit to make it worthy of my
attention?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;There are aspects about
which you should be consulted,&quot; Fane continued stubbornly. &quot;The
manual of procedure and discipline declares that such matters must be placed
before the commanding officer whose decision is final.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Quite right, quite
right.&quot; He regarded Fane with a little more favor. &quot;What are these
matters?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Time is important to us, and
the quicker these prisoners learn our language the better it will be. Here,
their minds are occupied by their predicament. They think too much of their
friends and families. In their own homes it would be different, and they could
learn at great speed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;A weak pretext,&quot;
scoffed Cruin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That is not all. By nature
they are naive and friendly. I feel that we have little to fear from them. Had
they been hostile they would have attacked by now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Not necessarily. It is wise
to be cautious. The manual of defense emphasizes that fact repeatedly. These
creatures may wish first to gain the measure of us before they try to deal with
us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Fane was prompt to snatch the
opportunity. &quot;Your point, sir, is also my final one. Here, they are six
pairs of eyes and six pairs of ears in the middle of us, and their absence is
likely to give cause for alarm in their home town. Were they there, complacency
would replace that alarmand we would be the eyes and ears!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Well put,&quot; commented
Jusik, momentarily forgetting himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Be silent!&quot; Cruin
glared at him. &quot;I do not recall any ruling in the manual pertaining to
such a suggestion as this. Let me check up.&quot; Grabbing his books, he sought
through them. He took a long time about it, gave up, and said: &quot;The only
pertinent rule appears to be that in circumstances not specified in the manual
the decision is wholly mine, to be made in light of said circumstances
providing that they do not conflict with the rulings of any other manual which
may be applicable to the situation, and providing that my decision does not
effectively countermand that or those of any senior ranking officer whose
authority extends to the same area.&quot; He took a deep breath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said Fane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Quite, sir,&quot; said
Parth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Cruin frowned heavily. &quot;How
far away are these prisoners' homes?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;One hour's walk.&quot; Fane
made a persuasive gesture. &quot;If anything did happen to uswhich I consider
extremely un­likelyone scout could wipe out their little town before they'd
time to realize what had happened. One scout, one bomb, one minute!&quot;
Dexterously, he added, &quot;At your order, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Cruin preened himself visibly.
&quot;I see no reason why we should not take advantage of their
stupidity.&quot; His eyes asked Jusik what he thought, but that person failed
to notice. &quot;Since you two tutors have brought this plan to me, I hereby
approve it, and I appoint you to carry it through.&quot; He consulted a list
which he extracted from a drawer. &quot;Take two psychologists with youKalma
and Hefni.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Very well, sir.&quot;
Impassively, Fane saluted and went out, Parth following.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Staring absently at his
half-written report, Cruin fiddled with his pen for a while, glanced up at
Jusik, and spat: &quot;At what are you smiling?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Jusik wiped it from his face,
looked solemn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Come on. Out with it!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I was thinking, sir,&quot;
replied Jusik, slowly, &quot;that three years in a ship is a very long
time.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Slamming his pen on the desk,
Cruin stood up. &quot;Has it been any longer for others than for me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;For you,&quot; said Jusik,
daringly but respectfully, &quot;I think it has been longest of all.&quot;<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>      </span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Get out!&quot; shouted
Cruin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He watched the other go, watched
the self-closer push the door, waited for its last click. He shifted his gaze
to the port, stared hard-eyed into the gathering dusk. His heelbells were
silent as he stood unmoving and saw the invisible sun sucking its last rays
from the sky.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>In short time, ten figures
strolled through the twilight toward the distant, tree-topped hill. Four were
uniformed; six in drab, shapeless clothes. They went by conversing with many
gestures, and one of them laughed. He gnawed his bot­tom lip as his gaze
followed them until they were gone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The price of rank.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Step eight: Repel initial
attacks in accordance with tech­niques detailed in manual of defense.&quot;
Cruin snorted, put up one hand, tidied his orders of merit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;There have been no
attacks,&quot; said Jusik.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I am not unaware of the
fact.&quot; The commander glowered at him. &quot;I'd have preferred an
onslaught. We are ready for them. The sooner they match their strength against
ours the sooner they'll learn who's boss now!&quot; He hooked big thumbs in his
silver-braided belt. &quot;And besides, it would give the men something to do.
I cannot have them everlastingly repeating their drills of procedure. We've
been here nine days and nothing has happened.&quot; His attention returned to
the book. &quot;Step nine: Follow defeat of initial attacks by taking
aggressive action as detailed in manual of defense.&quot; He gave another
snort. &quot;How can one follow something that has not occurred?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It is impossible,&quot;
Jusik ventured.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Nothing is impossible,&quot;
Cruin contradicted, harshly. &quot;Step ten: In the unlikely event that
intelligent life displays indifference or amity, remain in protective formation
while specimens are being tutored, meanwhile employing scout vessels to survey
surrounding area to the limit of their flight-duration, using no more than
one-fifth of the numbers available at any time.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That allows us eight or nine
scouts on survey,&quot; observed Jusik, thoughtfully. &quot;What is our
authorized step if they fail to return?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Why'd you ask that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>'Those eight scouts I sent out on
your orders forty periods ago are overdue.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Viciously, Commander Cruin thrust
away his book. His broad, heavy face was dark red.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Second Commander Jusik, it
was your duty to report this fact to me the moment those vessels became
overdue.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Which I have,&quot; said
Jusik, imperturbably. 'They have a flight-duration of forty periods, as you
know. That, sir, made them due a short time ago. They are now late.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Cruin tramped twice across the
room, medals clinking, heelbells jangling. &quot;The answer to nonappearance is
imme­diately to obliterate the areas in which they are held. No half-measures.
A salutary lesson.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Which areas, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Stopping in mid-stride, Cruin
bawled: &quot;You ought to know that. Those scouts had properly formulated
route orders, didn't they? It's a simple matter to&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He ceased as a shrill whine passed
overhead, lowered to a dull moan in the distance, curved back on a rising note
again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Number one.&quot; Jusik
looked at the little timemeter on the wall. &quot;Late, but here. Maybe the
others will turn up now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Somebody's going to get a
sharp lesson if they don't!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I'll see what he has to
report.&quot; Saluting, Jusik hurried through the doorway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Gazing out of his port, Cruin
observed the delinquent scout belly-sliding up to the nearest formation. He
chewed steadily at his bottom lip, a slow, persistent chew which showed his
thoughts to be wandering around in labyrinths of their own.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Beyond the fringe of dank, dead
ash were golden butter-cups in the grasses, and a hum of bees, and the gentle
rustle of leaves on trees. Four engine-room wranglers of ship num­ber seventeen
had found this sanctuary and sprawled flat on their backs in the shade of a
big-leafed and blossom-orna­mented growth. With eyes closed, their hands
plucked idly at surrounding grasses while they maintained a lazy, desul­tory
conversation through which they failed to hear the ring of Cruin's approaching
bells.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Standing before them, his
complexion florid, he roared: &quot;Get up!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shooting to their feet, they stood
stiffly shoulder to shoulder, faces expressionless, eyes level, hands at their
sides.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Your names?&quot; He wrote
them in his notebook while obe­diently they repeated them in precise,
unemotional voices. &quot;I'll deal with you later,&quot; he promised.
&quot;March!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Together, they saluted, marched
off with a rhythmic pounding of boots, one-two-three-hup! His angry stare
followed them until they reached the shadow of their ship. Not until then did
he turn and proceed. Mounting the hill, one cautious hand continually on the
cold butt of his gun, reached the crest, gazed down into the valley he'd just
left. In neat, exact positioning, the two star-formations of the ships of Huld
were silent and ominous.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>His hard, authoritative eyes
turned to the other side of the hill. There, the landscape was pastoral. A
wooded slope ran down to a little river which meandered into the hazy distance,
and on its farther side was a broad patchwork of culti­vated fields in which
three houses were visible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Seating himself on a large rock,
Cruin loosened his gun in its holster, took a wary look around, extracted a
small wad of reports from his pocket and glanced over them for the twentieth
time. A faint smell of herbs and resin came to his nostrils as he read.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I circled this landing place
at low altitude and recorded it photographically, taking care to include all
the machines standing thereon. Two other machines which were in the air went on
their way without attempting to interfere. It then occurred to me that the
signals they were making from the ground might he an invitation to land, and I
decided to utilize opportunism as recommended in the manual of pro­cedure.
Therefore I landed. They conducted my scout vessel to a dispersal point off the
runway and made me welcome.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Something fluted liquidly in a
nearby tree. Cruin looked up, his hand automatically seeking his holster. It
was only a bird. Skipping parts of the report, he frowned over the con­cluding
words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>.. lack of common speech made it
difficult for me to refuse, and after the sixth drink during my tour of the
town I was suddenly afflicted with a strange paralysis in the legs and collapsed
into the arms of my companions. Believing that they had poisoned me by guile, I
prepared for death .. . tickled my throat while making jocular remarks . . . I
was a little sick.&quot; Cruin rubbed his chin in puzzlement. &quot;Not until
they were satisfied about my recovery did they take me back to my vessel. They
waved their hands at me as I took off. I apologize to my captain for overdue
return and plead that it was because of factors beyond my control.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The fluter came down to Cruin's
feet, piped at him plain­tively. It cocked its head sidewise as it examined him
with bright, beady eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shifting the sheet he'd been
reading, he scanned the next one. It was neatly typewritten, and signed jointly
by Parth, Fane, Kalma and Hefni.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Do not appear fully to
appreciate what has occurred .. . seem to view the arrival of a Huldian fleet
as just another incident. They have a remarkable self-assurance which is
incomprehensible inasmuch as we can find nothing to justify such an attitude.
Mastery of them should be so easy that if our homing vessel does not leave too
soon it should be possible for it to bear tidings of conquest as well as of
mere discovery.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Conquest,&quot; he murmured.
It had a mighty imposing sound. A word like that would send a tremendous thrill
of excite­ment throughout the entire world of Huld.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Five before him had sent back
ships telling of discovery, but none had gone so far as he, none had traveled
so long and wearily, none had been rewarded with a planet so big, lush,
desirableand none had reported the subjection of their finds. One cannot
conquer a rocky waste. But this</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>In peculiarly accented Huldian, a
voice behind him said, brightly: &quot;Good morning!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He came up fast, his hand sliding
to his side, his face hard with authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>She was laughing at him with her
clear green eyes. &quot;Remember meMarva Meredith?&quot; Her flaming hair was
wind-blown. &quot;You see,&quot; she went on, in slow, awkward tones. &quot;I
know a little Huldian already. Just a few words.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Who taught you?&quot; he
asked, bluntly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Fane and Parth.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It is your house to which
they have gone?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Oh, yes. Kalma and Hefni are
guesting with Bill Gleeson; Fane and Parth with us. Father brought them to us.
They share the welcome room.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Welcome room?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Of course.&quot; Perching herself
on his rock, she drew up her slender legs, rested her chin on her knees. He
noticed that the legs, like her face, were freckled. &quot;Of course. Everyone
has a welcome room, haven't they?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Cruin said nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Haven't you a welcome room
in your home?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Home?&quot; His eyes strayed
away from hers, sought the flut­ing bird. It wasn't there. Somehow, his hand
had left his hol­ster without realizing it. He was holding his hands together,
each nursing the other, clinging, finding company, soothing each other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Her gaze was on his hands as she
said, softly and hesitant­ly, &quot;You have got a home . . . somewhere . . .
haven't you?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Lowering her legs, she stood up.
&quot;I'm so sorry.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You are sorry for me?&quot;
His gaze switched back to her. It held incredulity, amazement, a mite of anger.
His voice was harsh. &quot;You must be singularly stupid.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Am I?&quot; she asked,
humbly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No Member of my expedition
has a home,&quot; he went on. &quot;Every man was carefully selected. Every man
passed through a screen, suffered the most exacting tests. Intelligence and
technical competence were not enough; each had also to be young, healthy,
without ties of any sort. They were chosen for ability to concentrate on the
task in hand without indulg­ing morale-lowering sentimentalities about people
left behind.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I don't understand some of
your long words,&quot; she com­plained. &quot;And you are speaking far too
fast.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He repeated it more slowly and
with added emphasis, fin­ishing, &quot;Spaceships undertaking long absence from
base cannot be handicapped by homesick crews. We picked men without homes
because they can leave Huld and not care a hoot. They are pioneers!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;'Young, healthy, without
ties,' &quot; she quoted. &quot;That makes them strong?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Definitely,&quot; he
asserted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Men especially selected for
space. Strong men.&quot; Her lashes hid her eyes as she looked down at her
narrow feet. &quot;But now they are not in space. They are here, on firm
ground.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What of it,&quot; he
demanded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Nothing.&quot; Stretching
her arms wide, she took a deep breath, then dimpled at him. &quot;Nothing at
all.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You're only a child,&quot;
he reminded, scornfully. &quot;When you grow older&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You'll have more
sense,&quot; she finished for him, chanting it in a high, sweet voice.
&quot;You'll have more sense, you'll have more sense. When you grow older
you'll have more sense, tra-la-la-lala!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Gnawing irritatedly at his lip, he
walked past her, started down the hill toward the ships.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Where are you going?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Back!&quot; he snapped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Do you like it down
there?&quot; Her eyebrows arched in sur­prise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Stopping ten paces away, he
scowled at her. &quot;Is it any of your business?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I didn't mean to be
inquisitive,&quot; she apologized. &quot;I asked because . . . because&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Because what?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I was wondering whether you
would care to visit my house.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Nonsense! Impossible!&quot;
He turned to continue downhill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Father suggested it. He
thought you might like to share a meal. A fresh one. A change of diet.
Something to break the monotony of your supplies.&quot; The wind lifted her
crimson hair and played with it as she regarded him speculatively. &quot;He
consulted Fane and Parth. They said it was an excellent idea.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;They did, did they?&quot;
His features seemed molded in iron. &quot;Tell Pane and Parth they are to
report to me at sunset.&quot; He paused, added, &quot;Without fail!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Resuming her seat on the rock, she
watched him stride heavily down the slope toward the double star-formation. Her
hands were together in her lap, much as he had held his. But hers sought
nothing of each other. In complete repose, they merely rested with the
ineffable patience of hands as old as time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Seeing at a glance that he was
liverish, Jusik promptly postponed certain suggestions that he had in mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Summon captains Drek and
Belthan,&quot; Cruin ordered. When the other had gone, he flung his helmet onto
the desk, surveyed himself in a mirror. He was still smoothing the tired lines
on his face when approaching footsteps sent him officiously behind his desk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Entering, the two captains
saluted, remained rigidly at attention. Cruin studied them irefully while they
preserved wooden expressions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Eventually, be said: &quot;I found
four men lounging like un­disciplined hoboes outside the safety zone.&quot; He
stared at Drek. &quot;They were from your vessel.&quot; The stare shifted to
Belthan. &quot;You are today's commander of the guard. Have either of you
anything to say?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;They were off-duty and free
to leave the ship,&quot; exclaimed Drek. &quot;They had been warned not to go
beyond the perimeter of ash.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I don't know how they
slipped through,&quot; said Belthan, in official monotone. &quot;Obviously the
guards were lax. The fault is mine.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It will count against you in
your promotion records,&quot; Cruin promised. &quot;Punish these four, and the
responsible guards, as laid down in the manual of procedure and disci­pline.&quot;
He leaned across the desk to survey them more closely. &quot;A repetition will
bring ceremonial demotion!&quot; &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; they chorused.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Dismissing them, he glanced at
Jusik. &quot;When tutors Fane and Parth report here, send them in to me without
delay.&quot; &quot;As you order, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Cruin dropped the glance
momentarily, brought it back. &quot;What's the matter with you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Me?&quot; Jusik became
self-conscious. &quot;Nothing, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You lie! One has to live
with a person to know him. I've lived on your neck for three years. I know you
too well to be deceived. You have something on your mind.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It's the men,&quot; admitted
Jusik, resignedly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What of them?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;They are restless.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Are they? Well, I can devise
a cure for that! What's making them restless?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Several things, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Cruin waited while Jusik stayed
dumb, then roared: &quot;Do I have to prompt you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No, sir,&quot; Jusik
protested, unwillingly. &quot;It's many things. Inactivity. The substitution of
tedious routine. The constant waiting, waiting, waiting right on top of three
years close incarceration. They waitand nothing happens.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What else?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;The sight and knowledge of
familiar life just beyond the ash. The realization that Fane and Parth and the
others are enjoying it with your consent. The stories told by the scouts about
their experiences on landing.&quot; His gaze was steady as he went on.
&quot;We've now sent out five squadrons of scouts, a total of forty vessels.
Only six came back on time. All the rest were late on one plausible pretext or
another. The pilots have talked, and shown the men various sou­venir
photographs and a few gifts. One of them is undergoing punishment for bringing
back some bottles of paralysis-mixture. But the damage has been done. Their
stories have unsettled the men.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Anything more?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Begging your pardon, sir,
there was also the sight of you taking a stroll to the top of the hill. They
envied you even that!&quot; He looked squarely at Cruin. &quot;I envied you
myself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I am the commander,&quot;
said Cruin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Jusik kept
his gaze on him but added nothing more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>If the second commander expected a
delayed outburst, he was disappointed. A complicated series of emotions chased
each other across his superior's broad, beefy features. Laying back in his
chair, Cruin's eyes looked absently through the port while his mind juggled
with Jusik's words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Suddenly, be rasped: &quot;I have
observed more, antici­pated more and given matters more thought than perhaps you
realize. I can see something which you may have failed to perceive. It has
caused me some anxiety. Briefly, if we don't keep pace with the march of time
we're going to find ourselves in a fix.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Indeed, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I don't wish you to mention
this to anyone else: I suspect that we are trapped in a situation bearing no
resemblance to any dealt with in the manuals.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Really, sir?&quot; Jusik
licked his lips, felt that his own out­spokenness was leading into unexpected
paths.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Consider our present
circumstances,&quot; Cruin went on. &quot;We are established here and in
possession of power sufficient to enslave this planet. Any one of our supply of
bombs could blast a portion of this earth stretching from horizon to horizon.
But they're of no use unless we apply them effec­tively. We can't drop them
anywhere, haphazardly. If parting with them in so improvident a manner proved
unconvincing to our opponents, and failed to smash the hard core of their
resistance, we would find ourselves unarmed in a hostile world. No more bombs. None
nearer than six long years away, three there and three back. Therefore we must
apply our power where it will do the most good.&quot; He began to mas­sage his
heavy chin. &quot;We don't know where to apply it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No, sir,&quot; agreed Jusik,
pointlessly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We've got to determine which
cities are the key points of their civilization, which persons are this
planet's acknowl­edged leaders, and where they're located. When we strike, it
must be at the nerve-centers. That means we're impotent until we get the
necessary information. In turn, that means we've got to establish communication
with the aid of tutors.&quot; He started plucking at his jaw muscles. &quot;And
that takes time!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Quite, sir, but&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;But while time crawls past
the men's morale evaporates.This is our twelfth day and already the crews are
restless. Tomorrow they'll be more so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I have a solution to that,
sir, if you will forgive me for offering it,&quot; said Jusik, eagerly.
&quot;On Huld everyone gets one day's rest in five. They are free to do as they
like, go where they like. Now if you promulgated an order permitting the men
say one day's liberty in ten, it would mean that no more than ten percent of
our strength would be lost on any one day. We could stand that reduction
considering our power, especially if more of the others are on protective
duty.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;So at last I get what was
occupying your mind. It comes out in a swift flow of words.&quot; He smiled
grimly as the other flushed. &quot;I have thought of it. I am not quite so
unimagina­tive as you may consider me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I don't look upon you that
way, sir,&quot; Jusik protested.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Never mind. We'll let that
pass. To return to this subject of libertythere lies the trap! There is the
very quandary with which no manual deals, the situation for which I can find no
officially prescribed formula.&quot; Putting a hand on his desk he tapped the
polished surface impatiently. &quot;If I refuse these men a little freedom,
they will become increasing­ly restlessnaturally. If I permit them the liberty
they desire, they will experience contact with life more normal even though
alien, and again become more restless--naturally!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Permit me to doubt the
latter, sir. Our crews are loyal to Huld. Blackest space forbid that it should
be otherwise!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;They were loyal. Probably
they are still loyal.&quot; Cruin's face quirked as his memory brought forward
the words that followed. &quot;They are young, healthy, without ties. In space,
that means one thing. Here, another.&quot; He came slowly to his feet, big,
bulky and imposing. &quot;I know!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Looking at him, Jusik felt that
indeed he did know. &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; he parroted, obediently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Therefore the onus of what
to do for the best falls squarely upon me. I must use my initiative. As second
com­mander it is for you to see that my orders are carried out to the
letter.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I know my duty, sir.&quot;
Jusik's thinly-drawn features regis­tered growing uneasiness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;And it is my final decision
that the men must be restrained from contact with our opponents, with no
exceptions other than the four technicians operating under my orders. The crews
are to be permitted no liberty, no freedom to go beyond the ash. Any form of
resentment on their part must be countered immediately and ruthlessly. You will
instruct the captains to watch for murmurers in their respective crews and take
appropriate action to silence them as soon as found.&quot; His jowls jumped,
and his eyes were cold as he regarded the other. &quot;All scout-flights are
canceled as from now, and all scout-vessels remain grounded. None moves without
my personal instructions.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That is going to deprive us
of a lot of information,&quot; Jusik observed. &quot;The last flight to the
south reported discovery of ten cities completely deserted, and that's got some
significance which we ought to&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I said the flights are
canceled!&quot; Cruin shouted. &quot;If I say the scout-vessels are to be
painted pale pink, they will be painted pale pink, thoroughly, completely, from
end to end. I am the commander!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;As you order, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Finally, you may instruct
the captains that their vessels are to be prepared for my inspection at midday
tomorrow. That will give the crews something to do.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Very well, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>With a worried salute, Jusik
opened the door, glanced out and said: &quot;Here are Fane, Kalma, Parth and
Hefni, sir.&quot; &quot;Show them in.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>After Cruin had given forcible
expression to his views, Fane said: &quot;We appreciate the urgency, sir, and
we are doing our best, but it is doubtful whether they will be fluent before
another four weeks have passed. They are slow to learn.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I don't want fluency,&quot;
Cruin growled. &quot;All they need are enough words to tell us the things we
want to know, the things we must know before we can get anywhere.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I said sufficient
fluency,&quot; Fane reminded. &quot;They communi­cate mostly by signs even
now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That flame-headed girl
didn't.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;She has been quick,&quot;
admitted Fane. &quot;Possibly she has an above-normal aptitude for languages.
Unfortunately she knows the least in any military sense and therefore is of
little use to us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Cruin's gaze ran over him
balefully. His voice became low and menacing. &quot;You have lived with these
people many days. I look upon your features and find them different. Why is
that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Different?&quot; The four
exchanged wondering looks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Your faces have lost their
lines, their space-gauntness. Your cheeks have become plump, well-colored. Your
eyes are no, longer tired. They are bright. They hold the self-satisfied
expression of a fat skodar wallowing in its trough. It is obvious that you have
done well for yourselves.&quot; He bent forward, his mouth ugly. &quot;Can it
be that you are in no great hurry to complete your task?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They were suitably shocked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We have eaten well and slept
regularly,&quot; Fane said. &quot;We feel better for it. Our physical
improvement has enabled us to work so much the harder. In our view, the foe is
support­ing us unwittingly with his own hospitality, and since the manual
of&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Hospitality?&quot; Cruin cut
in, sharply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Fane went mentally off-balance as
vainly he sought for a less complimentary synonym.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I give you another
week,&quot; the commander harshed. &quot;No more. Not one day more. At this
time, one week from today, you will report here with the six prisoners
adequately tutored to understand my questions and answer them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It will be difficult,
sir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Nothing is difficult.
Nothing is impossible. There are no excuses for anything.&quot; He studied Fane
from beneath forbidding brows. &quot;You have my ordersobey them!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>His hard stare shifted to Kalma
and Hefni. &quot;So much for the tutors; now you. What have you to tell me? How
much have you discovered?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Blinking nervously, Hefni said:
&quot;It is not a lot. The language trouble is&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;May the Giant Sun burn up
and perish the language trou­ble! How much have you learned while enjoyably
larding your bellies?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Glancing down at his uniform-belt
as if suddenly and painfully conscious of its tightness, Hefni recited:
&quot;They are ex­ceedingly strange in so far as they appear to be highly civil­ized
in a purely domestic sense but quite primitive in all others. This Meredith
family lives in a substantial, well-equipped house. They have every comfort,
including a color-television receiver.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You're dreaming! We are
still seeking the secrets of plain television even on Huld. Color is
unthinkable.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Kalma chipped in with:
&quot;Nevertheless, sir, they have it. We have seen it for ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That is so,&quot; confirmed
Fane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Shut up!&quot; Cruin burned
him with a glare. &quot;I have finished with you. I am now dealing with these
two.&quot; His attention returned to the quaking Hefni: &quot;Carry on.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;There is something decidedly
queer about them which we've not yet been able to understand. They have no
medium of exchange. They barter goods for goods without any re­gard for the
relative values of either. They work when they feel like it. If they don't feel
like it, they don't work. Yet, in spite of this, they work most of the
time.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Why?&quot; demanded Cruin,
incredulously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We asked them. They said
that one works to avoid boredom. We cannot comprehend that viewpoint.&quot;
Hefni made a defeated gesture. &quot;In many places they have small factories
which, with their strange, perverted logic, they use as amuse­ment centers.
These plants operate only when people turn up to work.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Eh?&quot; Cruin looked
baffled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;For example, in
Williamsville, a small town an hour's walk beyond the Meredith home, there is a
shoe factory. It operates every day. Some days there may be only ten workers
there, other days fifty or a hundred, but nobody can remember a time when the
place stood idle for lack of one voluntary worker. Meredith's elder daughter,
Marva, has worked there three days during our stay with them. We asked her the
reason.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What did she say?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;For fun.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Fun . . . fun . . .
fun?&quot; Cruin struggled with the concept. &quot;What does that mean?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We don't know,&quot; Hefni
confessed. &quot;The barrier of speech&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Red flames lick up the
barrier of speech!&quot; Cruin bawled. &quot;Was her attendance
compulsory?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You are certain of
that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We are positive. One works
in a factory for no other reason than because one feels like it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;For what reward?&quot;
topped Cruin, shrewdly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Anything or nothing.&quot;
Hefni uttered it like one in a dream.&quot;One day she brought back a pair of
shoes for her mother. We asked if they were her reward for the work she had
done. She said they were not, and that someone named George had made them and
given them to her. Apparently the rest of the factory's output for that week
was shipped to another town where shoes were required. This other town is going
to send back a supply of leather, nobody knows how muchand nobody seems to
care.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Senseless,&quot; defined
Cruin. &quot;It is downright imbecility.&quot; He examined Hefni as if
suspecting him of inventing confusing data. &quot;It is impossible for even the
most primitive of organi­zations to operate so haphazardly. Obviously you have
seen only part of the picture; the rest has been concealed from you, or you
have been too dull-witted to perceive it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I assure you, sir,&quot;
began Hefni.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Let it pass,&quot; Crain cut
in. &quot;Why should I care how they function economically? In the end, they'll
work the way we want them to!&quot; He rested his heavy jaw in one hand.
&quot;There are other matters which interest me more. For instance, our scouts
have brought in reports of many cities. Some are organized but grossly
under-populated; others are completely deserted. The former have
well-constructed landing places with air-machines making use of them. How is it
that people so primitive have air-machines?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Some make shoes, some make
air-machines, some play with television. They work according to their aptitudes
as well as their inclinations.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Has this Meredith got an
air-machine?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No.&quot; The look of defeat
was etched more deeply on Hef­ni's face. &quot;If he wanted one he would have
his desire in­serted in the television supply-and-demand program.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Then what?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Sooner or later, he'd get
one, new or secondhand, either in exchange for something or as a gift.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Just by asking for it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Getting up, Crain strode to and
fro across his office. The steel heel-plates on his boots clanked on the metal
floor in rhythm with the bells. He was ireful, impatient, dissatisfied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;In all this madness is
nothing which tells us anything of their true character or their
organization.&quot; Stopping his stride, he faced Hefni. &quot;You boasted that
you were to be the eyes and ears.&quot; He released a loud snort. &quot;Blind
eyes and deaf ears! Not one word about their numerical strength, not one&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Pardon me, sir,&quot; said
Hefni quickly, &quot;there are twenty-seven millions of them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Ah!&quot; Cruin registered
sharp interest. &quot;Only twenty-seven millions? Why, there's a hundred times
that number on Huld which has no greater area of land surface.&quot; He mused a
moment. &quot;Greatly underpopulated. Many cities devoid of a living soul. They
have air-machines and other items sugges­tive of a civilization greater than
the one they now enjoy. They operate the remnants of an economic system. You
realize what all this means?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Hefei blinked, made no reply.
Kalma looked thoughtful. Fane and Parth remained blank-faced and tight-lipped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It means two things,&quot;
Cruin pursued. &quot;War or disease. One or the other, or perhaps bothand on a
large scale. I want information on that. I've got to learn what sort of weapons
they employed in their war, how many of them remain available, and where. Or,
alternatively, what disease ravished their numbers, its source, and its
cure.&quot; He tapped Hefni's chest to emphasize his words. &quot;I want to
know what they've got hidden away, what they're trying to keep from your
knowledge against the time when they can bring it out and use it against us.
Above all, I want to know which people will issue orders for their general
offensive and where they are located.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I understand, sir,&quot;
said Hefni, doubtfully.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That's the sort of
information I need from your six speci­mens. I want information, not
invitations to meals!&quot; His grin was ugly as he noted Hefni's wince.
&quot;If you can get it out of them before they're due here, I shall enter the
fact on the credit side of your records. But if I, your commander, have to do
your job by extracting it from them myself&quot; Ominously, be left the
sentence unfinished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Hefni opened his mouth, closed it,
glanced nervously at Kalma who stood stiff and dumb at his side.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You may go,&quot; Cruin
snapped at the four of them. &quot;You have one week. If you fail me, I shall
deem it a front-line offense and deal with it in accordance with the
active-service section of the manual of procedure and discipline.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They were pale as they saluted. He
watched them file out, his lips curling contemptuously. Going to the port, he
gazed into the gathering darkness, saw a pale star winking in the east. Low and
far it wasbut not so far as Huld.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>In the mid-period of the sixteenth
day, Commander Cruin strode forth polished and bemedaled, directed his
bell-jangling feet toward the hill. A sour-faced guard saluted him at the edge
of the ash and made a slovenly job of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Is that the beat you can
do?&quot; He glared into the other's surly eyes. &quot;Repeat it!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The guard saluted a fraction more
swiftly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You're out of
practice,&quot; Cruin informed. &quot;Probably all the crews are out of
practice. We'll find a remedy for that. We'll have a period of saluting drill
every day.&quot; His glare went slowly up and down the guard's face. &quot;Are
you dumb?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Shut up!&quot; roared Cruin.
He expanded his chest. &quot;Continue with your patrol.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The guard's optics burned with
resentment as he saluted for the third time, turned with the regulation
heel-click and marched along the perimeter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Mounting the hill, Cruin sat on
the stone at the top. Al­ternately he viewed the ships lying in the valley and
the op­posite scene with its trees, fields and distant houses. The metal helmet
with its ornamental wings was heavy upon his head but he did not remove it. In
the shadow beneath the projecting visor, his cold eyes brooded over the
landscape to one side and the other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>She came eventually. He had been
sitting there for one and a half periods when she came as he had known she
wouldwithout knowing what weird instinct had made him certain of this.
Certainly, he had no desire to see herno desire at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Through the trees she tripped
light-footed, with Sue and Sam and three other girls of her own age. The
newcomers had large, dark, humorous eyes, their hair was dark, and they were
leggy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Oh, hello!&quot; She paused
as she saw him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Hello!&quot; echoed Sue,
swinging her pigtails.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;'La!&quot; piped Sam,
determined not to he left out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Cruin frowned at them. There was a
high gloss on his jack boots, and his helmet glittered in the sun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;These are my friends,&quot;
said Marva, in her alien-accented Huldian. &quot;Becky, Rita and Joyce.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The three smiled at him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I brought them to see the
ships.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Cruin said nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You don't mind them looking
at the ships, do you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>No,&quot; he growled with
reluctance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Lankily but gracefully she seated
herself on the grass. The others followed suit with the exception of Sam who
stood with fat legs braced apart sucking his thumb, and solemnly studying
Cruin's decorated jacket.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Father was disappointed
because you could not visit us.&quot; Cruin made no reply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Mother was sorry, too. She's
a wonderful cook. She loves a guest.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>No reply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Would you care to come this
evening?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Some other evening?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Young lady,&quot; he
harshed, severely, &quot;I do not pay visits. Nobody pays visits.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>She translated this to the others.
They laughed so heartily that Cruin reddened and stood up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What's funny about
that?&quot; he demanded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Nothing, nothing.&quot;
Marva was embarrassed. &quot;If I told you, I fear that you would not
understand.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I would not
understand.&quot; His grim eyes became alert, calculating as they went over her
three friends. &quot;I do not think, somehow, that they were laughing at me.
Therefore they were laughing at what I do not know. They were laugh­ing at
something I ought to know but which you do not wish to tell me.&quot; He bent
over her, huge and muscular, while she looked up at him with her great green
eyes. &quot;And what remark of mine revealed my amusing ignorance?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Her steady gaze remained on him
while she made no an­swer. A faint but sweet scent exuded from her hair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I said that nobody pays
visits,&quot; he repeated. &quot;That was the amusing remarknobody pays
visits. And I am not a fool!&quot; Straightening, he turned away. &quot;So I am
going to call the rolls!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He could feel their eyes upon him
as he started down the valley. They were silent except for Sam's high-pitched,
child­ish, &quot;Bye!&quot; which he ignored.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Without once looking back, he
gained his flagship, mounted its metal ladder, made his way to the office and
summoned Jusik.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>`&quot;Order the captains to call
their rolls at once.&quot; &quot;Is something wrong, sir?&quot; inquired Jusik,
anxiously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Call the roles!&quot; Cruin
bellowed, whipping off his helmet. &quot;Then we'll know whether anything is
wrong.&quot; Savagely, he flung the helmet onto a wall hook, sat down, mopped
his forehead!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Jusik was gone for most of a
period. In the end he returned, set-faced, grave.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I regret to report that
eighteen men are absent, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;They laughed,&quot; said
Cruin, bitterly. &quot;They laughedbe­cause they knew!&quot; His knuckles were
white as his hands gripped the arms of his chair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I beg your pardon,
sir?&quot; Jusik's eyebrows lifted. &quot;How long have they been absent?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Eleven of them were on duty
this morning.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That means the other seven
have been missing since yes­terday?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I'm afraid so, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;But no one saw fit to inform
me of this fact?&quot; Jusik fidgeted: &quot;No, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Have you discovered anything
else of which I have not been informed?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The other fidgeted again, looked
pained.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Out with it, man!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It is not the absentees'
first offense,&quot; Jusik said with difficulty. &quot;Nor their second.
Perhaps not their sixth.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>`&quot;How long has this been
going on?&quot; Cruin waited a while, then bawled: &quot;Come on! You are
capable of speech!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;About ten days, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;How many captains were aware
of this and failed to report it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Nine, sir. Four of them
await your bidding outside.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;And what of the other
five?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;They . . . they&quot; Jusik
licked his lips.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Cruin arose, his expression
dangerous. &quot;You cannot con­ceal the truth by delaying it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;They are among the absentees,
sir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I see!&quot; Cruin stamped
to the door, stood by it. &quot;We can take it for granted that others have
absented themselves without permission, but were fortunate enough to be here
when the rolls were called. That is their good luck. The real total of the
disobedient cannot be discovered. They have sneaked away like nocturnal
animals, and in the same manner they sneak back. All are guilty of desertion in
the face of the enemy. There is one penalty for that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Surely, sir, considering the
circ&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Considering nothing!&quot;
Cruin's voice shot up to an enraged shout. &quot;Death! The penally is
death!&quot; Striding to the table, he hammered the books lying upon it.
&quot;Summary execution as laid down in the manual of procedure and discipline.
Deser­tion, mutinous conduct, defiance of a superior officer, conspiracy to
thwart regulations and defy my ordersall punishable by death!&quot; His voice
lowered as swiftly as it had gone up. &quot;Besides, my dear Jusik, if we fail
through disintegration attributable to our own deliberate disregard of the
manuals, what will be the penalty payable by us? What will it be, eh?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Death,&quot; admitted Jusik.
He looked at Cruin. &quot;On Huld, anyway &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We are on Huld! This is
Huld! I have claimed this planet in the name of Huld and therefore it is part
of it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;A mere claim, sir, if I may
say&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Jusik, are you with these
conspirators in opposing my authority?&quot; Cruin's eyes glinted. His hand lay
over his gun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Oh, no, sir!&quot; The
second commander's features mirrored the emotions conflicting within him.
&quot;But permit me to point out, sir, that we are a brotherly band who've been
cooped to­gether a long, long time and already have suffered losses getting
here as we shall do getting back. One can hardly ex­pect the men to&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I expect obedience!&quot;
Cruin's hand remained on the gun. &quot;I expect iron discipline and immediate,
willing, unquestiona­ble obedience. With those, we conquer. Without them, we
fail.&quot; He gestured to the door. &quot;Are those captains properly prepared
for examination as directed in the manuals?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes, sir. They are disarmed
and under guard.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Parade them in.&quot;
Leaning on the edge of his desk, Cruin prepared to pass judgment on his
fellows. The minute he waited for them was long, long as any minute he had ever
known.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>There had been scent in her hair.
And her eyes were cool and green. Iron discipline must be maintained. The price
of power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The manual provided an escape.
Facing the four captains, he found himself taking advantage of the legal
loophole to substitute demotion for the more drastic and final penalty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Tramping the room before them
while they stood in a row, pale-faced and rigid, their tunics unbuttoned, their
ceremonial belts missing, the guards impassive on either side of them, he
rampaged and swore and sprinkled them with verbal vitriol while his right fist
hammered steadily into the palm of his left hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;But since you were present
at the roll call, and therefore are not technically guilty of desertion, and
since you sur­rendered yourself to my judgment immediately you were called upon
to do so, I hereby sentence you to be demoted to the basic rank, the
circumstances attending this sentence to be entered in your records.&quot; He
dismissed them with a curt flourish of his white-gloved hand. &quot;That is
all.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They filed out silently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>He looked at Jusik. &quot;Inform
the respective lieutenant cap­tains that they are promoted to full captains and
now must enter recommendations for their vacated positions. These must be
received by me before nightfall.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;As you order, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Also warn them to prepare to
attend a commanding officer's court which will deal with the lower-ranking
absen­tees as and when they reappear. Inform Captain Somir that he is appointed
commander of the firing squad which will carry out the decisions of the court
immediately they are pronounced.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Gaunt and
hollow-eyed, Jusik turned with a click of heels and departed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>When the closer had shut the door,
Cruin sat at his desk, placed his elbows on its surface, held his face in his
hands. If the deserters did not return, they could not be punished. No power,
no authority could vent its wrath upon an absent body. The law was impotent if
its subjects lacked the es­sential feature of being present. All the laws of
Huld could not put memories of lost men before a firing squad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>It was imperative that he make an
example of the offenders. Their sly, furtive trips into the enemy's camp, he
suspected, had been repeated often enough to have become a habit. Doubtless by
now they were settled wherever they were visit­ing, sharing homeswelcome
roomssharing food, company, laughter. Doubtless they had started to regain
weight, to lose the space lines on their cheeks and foreheads, and the light in
their eyes had begun to burn anew; and they had talked with signs and pictures,
played games, tried to suck smoke things, and strolled with girls through the
fields and the glades.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>A pulse was beating steadily in
the thickness of his neck as he stared through the port and waited for some
sign that the tripled ring of guards had caught the first on his way in. Down,
down, deep down inside him at a depth too great for him to admit that it was
there, lay the disloyal hope that none would return.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>One deserter would mean the slow,
shuffling tread of the squad, the hoarse calls of &quot;Aim!&quot; and
&quot;Fire!&quot; and the stepping forward of Somir, gun in hand, to adminis­ter
the mercy shot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Damn the manuals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>At the end of the first period
after nightfall Jusik burst into the office, saluted, breathed heavily. The
glare of the ceiling illumination deepened the lines on his thin features,
magnified the bristles on his unshaven chin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Sir, I have to report that
the men are getting out of control.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What d'you mean?&quot;
Cruin's heavy brows came down as he stared fiercely at the other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;They know of the recent demotions,
of course. They know also that a court will assemble to deal with the
absentees.&quot; He took another long-drawn breath. &quot;And they also know
the penalty these absentees must face.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;So?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;So more of them have
desertedthey've gone to warn the others not to return.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Ah!&quot; Cruin smiled
lopsidedly. &quot;The guards let them walk out, eh? Just like that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Ten of the guards went with
them,&quot; said Jusik.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Ten?&quot; Coming up fast,
Cruin moved near to the other, studied him searchingly. &quot;How many went
alto­gether?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Ninety-seven.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Grabbing his helmet, Cruin slammed
it on, pulled the metal chin strap over his jaw muscles. &quot;More than one
complete crew.&quot; He examined his gun, shoved it back, strapped on a second
one. &quot;At that rate they'll all be gone by morning.&quot; He eyed Jusik.
&quot;Don't you think so?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That's what I'm afraid of
sir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Cruin patted his shoulder.
'&quot;The answer, Jusik, is an easy onewe take off immediately.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Take off?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Most certainly. The whole
fleet. We'll strike a bal­anced orbit where it will be impossible for any man
to leave. I will then give the situation more thought. Prob­ably we'll make a
new landing in some locality where none will be tempted to sneak away because
there'll be nowhere to go. A scout can pick up Fane and his party in due
course.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I doubt whether they'll obey
orders for departure, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We'll see, we'll see.&quot;
'He smiled again, hard and craggy. &quot;As you would know if you'd studied the
man­uals properly, it is not difficult to smash incipient mu­tiny. All one has
to do is remove the ringleaders. No mob is composed of men, as such. It is made
up of a few ringleaders and a horde of stupid followers.&quot; He patted his
guns. &quot;You can always tell a ringleaderinvariably he is the first to open
his mouth!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; mouthed
Jusik, with misgivings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Sound the call for general
assembly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The flagship's siren wailed
dismally in the night. Lights flashed from ship to ship, and startled birds
woke up and squawked in the trees beyond the ash.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Slowly, deliberately,
impressively, Cruin came down the ladder, faced the audience whose features
were a mass of white blobs in the glare of the ships' beams. The captains and
lieutenant captains ranged themselves behind him and to either side. Each
carried an extra gun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;After three years of devoted
service to Huld,&quot; he enunciated pompously, &quot;some men have failed me.
It seems that we have weaklings among us, weaklings un­able to stand the strain
of a few extra days before our triumph. Careless of their duty, they disobey
orders, fraternize with the enemy, consort with our opponents females, and try
to snatch a few creature comforts at the expense of the many.&quot; His hard,
accusing eyes went over them: &quot;In due time they will be punished with the
utmost severity.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They stared back at him
expressionlessly. He could shoot the ears off a running man at twenty-five
yards, and he was waiting for his target to name itself. So were those at his
side.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>None spoke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Among you may be others
equally guilty but not discovered. They need not congratulate themselves, for
they are about to be deprived of further opportunities to exercise their
disloyalty.&quot; His stare kept flickering over them while his hand remained
ready at his side. &quot;We are going to trim the ships and take off, seeking a
balanced orbit. That means lost sleep and plenty of hard work for which you
have your treacherous comrades to thank.&quot; He paused a moment, fin­ished
with: &quot;Has anyone anything to say?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>One man holding a thousand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Prepare for departure,&quot;
he snapped, and turned his back upon them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Captain Somir, now facing him,
yelped: &quot;Look out, com­mander!&quot; and whipped up his gun to fire over
Cruin's shoul­der.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Cruin made to turn, conscious of a
roar behind him, his guns coming out as he twisted around. He heard no crack
from Somir's weapon, saw no more of his men as their roar cut off abruptly.
There seemed to be an intolerable weight upon his skull, the grass came up to
meet him, he let go his guns and put out his hands to save himself. Then the
hazily dancing lights faded from his eyesight and all was black.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Deep in his sleep he heard vaguely
and uneasily a prolonged stamping of feet, many dull, elusive sounds as of
people shouting far, far away. This went on for a considerable time, and ended
with a series of violent reports that shook the ground beneath his body.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Someone splashed water over his
face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Sitting up, he held his throbbing
head, saw pale fingers of dawn feeling through the sky to one side. Blinking
his aching eyes to clear them, he perceived Jusik, Somir and eight others. All
were smothered in dirt, their faces bruised, their uniforms torn and
bedraggled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;They rushed us the moment
you turned away from them,&quot; explained Jusik, morbidly. &quot;A hundred of
them in the front. They rushed us in one united frenzy, and the rest followed.
There were too many for us.&quot; He regarded his superior with red-rimmed
optics. &quot;You have been flat all night.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Unsteadily, Cruin got to his feet,
teetered to and fro. &quot;How many were killed?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;None. We fired over their
heads. After thatit was too late.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Over their heads?&quot;
Squaring his massive shoulders, Cruin felt a sharp pain in the middle of his
back, ignored it. &quot;What are guns for if not to kill?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It isn't easy,&quot; said
Jusik, with the faintest touch of defiance. &quot;Not when they're one's own
comrades.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Do you agree?&quot; The
commander's glare challenged the others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They nodded miserably, and Somir
said: &quot;There was little time, sir, and if one hesitates, as we did, it
becomes&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;There are no excuses for
anything. You had your orders; it was for you to obey them.&quot; His hot gaze
burned one, then the other. &quot;You are incompetent for your rank. You are
both demoted!&quot; His jaw came forward, ugly, aggressive, as he roared:
&quot;Get out of my sight!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The mooched away. Savagely, he
climbed the ladder, en­tered his ship, explored it from end to end. There was
not a soul on board. His lips were tight as he reached the tail, found the
cause of the earth-rocking detonations. The fuel tanks had been exploded,
wrecking the engines and reducing the whole vessel to a useless mass of metal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Leaving, he inspected the rest of
his fleet. Every ship was the same, empty and wrecked beyond possibility of
repair. At least the mutineers had been thorough and logical in their sabotage.
Until a report-vessel arrived, the home world of Huld had no means of knowing
where the expedition had landed. Despite even a systematic and wide-scale
search it might well be a thousand years before Huldians found this particular
planet again. Effectively the rebels had marooned themselves for the rest of
their natural lives and placed themselves beyond reach of Huldian retribution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Tasting to the full the bitterness
of defeat, he squatted on the bottom rung of the twenty-second vessel's ladder,
sur­veyed the double star-formations that represented his ruined armada.
Futilely, their guns pointed over surrounding terrain. Twelve of the scouts, he
noted, had gone. The others had been rendered as useless as their parent
vessels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Raising his gaze to the hill, he
perceived silhouettes against the dawn where Jusik, Somir and the others were
walking over the crest, walking away from him, making for the farther valley he
had viewed so often. Four children joined them at the top, romped beside them
as they proceeded. Slowly the whole group sank from sight under the rising sun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Returning to the flagship, Cruin
packed a patrol sack with personal possessions, strapped it on his shoulders.
Without a final glance at the remains of his once-mighty command he set forth
away from the sun, in the direction opposite to that taken by the last of his
men.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>His jack boots were dull, dirty.
His orders of merit hung lopsidedly and had a gap where one had been torn off
in the fracas. The bell was missing from his right boot; he endured the
pad-ding, pad-ding of its fellow for twenty steps before he unscrewed it and slung
it away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The sack on his back was heavy,
but not so heavy as the immense burden upon his mind. Grimly, stubbornly he
plodded on, away from the ships, far, far into the morning mistsfacing the new
world alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Three and a half years had bitten
deep into the ships of Huld. Still they lay in the valley, arranged with
mathematical precision, noses in, tails out, as only authority could place
them. But the rust had eaten a quarter of the way through the thickness of
their tough shells, and their metal ladders were rotten and treacherous. The
field mice and the voles had found refuge beneath them; the birds and spiders
had sought sanctuary within them. A lush growth had sprung from encompassing
ash, hiding the perimeter for all time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The man who came by them in the
midafternoon rested his pack and studied them silently, from a distance. He was
big, burly, with a skin the color of old leather. His deep gray eyes were calm,
thoughtful as they observed the thick ivy climb­ing over the flagship's tail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Having looked at them for a musing
half hour he hoisted his pack and went on, up the hill, over the crest and into
the farther valley. Moving easily in his plain, loose-fitting clothes, his pace
was deliberate, methodical.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Presently he struck a road,
followed it to a stone-built cottage in the garden of which a lithe,
dark-haired woman was cutting flowers. Leaning on the gate, he spoke to her.
His speech was fluent but strangely accented. His tones were gruff but
pleasant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Good afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>She stood up, her arms full of
gaudy blooms, looked at him with rich, black eyes. &quot;Good afternoon.&quot;
Her full lips parted with pleasure. &quot;Are you touring? Would you care to
guest with us? I am sure that Jusikmy husbandwould be delighted to have you.
Our welcome room has not been oc­cupied for&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I am sorry.&quot; he chipped
in. &quot;I am seeking the Merediths. Could you direct me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;The next house up the
lane.&quot; Deftly, she caught a falling bloom, held it to her breast. &quot;lf
their welcome room has a guest, please remember us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I will remember,&quot; he
promised. Eying her approvingly, his broad, muscular face lit up with a smile.
&quot;Thank you so much.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Shouldering his pack he marched
on, conscious of her eyes following him. He reached the gate of the next place,
a long, rambling, picturesque house fronted by a flowering garden. A boy was
playing by the gate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Glancing up as the other stopped
near him, the boy said: &quot;Are you touring, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Sir?&quot; echoed the man.
&quot;Sir?&quot; His face quirked. &quot;Yes, sonny, I am touring. I'm looking
for the Merediths.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Why, I'm Sam Meredith!&quot;
The boy's face flushed with sudden excitement. &quot;You wish to guest with
us?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;If I may.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yow-ee!&quot; He fled
frantically along the garden path, shriek­ing at the top of his voice,
&quot;Mom, Pop, Marva, Suewe've got a guest!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>A tall, red-headed man came to the
door, pipe in mouth. Coolly, calmly, he surveyed the visitor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>After a little while, the man
removed the pipe and said: &quot;I'm Jake Meredith. Please come in.&quot;
Standing aside, he let the other enter, then called, &quot;Mary, Mary, can you
get a meal for a guest?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Right away,&quot; assured a
cheerful voice from the back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Come with me.&quot; Meredith
led the other to the veranda, found him an easy-chair. &quot;Might as well rest
while you're waiting. Mary takes time. She isn't satisfied until the legs of
the table are near to collapseand woe betide you if you leave anything.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It is good of you.&quot;
Seating himself, the visitor drew a long breath, gazed over the pastoral scene
before him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Taking another chair, Meredith
applied a light to his pipe. &quot;Have you seen the mail ship?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes, it arrived early
yesterday. I was lucky enough to view it as it passed overhead.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You certainly were lucky
considering that it comes only once in four years. I've seen it only twice,
myself. It came right over this house. An imposing sight.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Very!&quot; indorsed the
visitor, with unusual emphasis. &quot;It looked to me about five miles long, a
tremendous creation. It's mass must be many times greater than that of all
those alien ships in the valley.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Many times,&quot; agreed
Meredith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The other leaned forward, watching
his host. &quot;I often wonder whether those aliens attributed smallness of num­bers
to war or disease, not thinking of large-scale emigration, nor realizing what
it means.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I doubt whether they cared
very much seeing that they burned their boats and settled among us.&quot; He
pointed with the stem of his pipe. &quot;One of them lives in that cottage down
there. Jusik's his name. Nice fellow. He married a local girl eventually. They
are very happy.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I'm sure they are.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>They were quite a long time, then
Meredith spoke absently, as if thinking aloud. &quot;They brought with them
weapons of considerable might, not knowing that we have a weapon truly
invincible.&quot; Waving one hand, he indicated the world at large. &quot;It
took us thousands of years to learn about the sheer invincibility of an idea.
That's what we've gota way of life, an idea. Nothing can blast that to shreds.
Nothing can defeat an ideaexcept a better one.&quot; He put the pipe hack in
his mouth. &quot;So far, we have failed to find a better one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;They came at the wrong
time,&quot; Meredith went on. &quot;Ten thousand years too late.&quot; He
glanced sidewise at his listener. &quot;Our history covers a long, long day. It
was so lurid that it came out in a new edition every minute. But this one's the
late night final.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You philosophize, eh?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Meredith smiled. &quot;I often sit
here to enjoy my silences. I sit here and think. Invariably I end up with the
same con­clusion.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What may that be?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;That if I, personally, were
in complete possession of all the visible stars and their multitude of planets
I would still be subject to one fundamental limitation&quot;bending, he tapped
his pipe on his heel&quot;in this respectthat no man can eat more than his
belly can hold.&quot; He stood up, tall, wide-chested. &quot;Here comes my
daughter, Marva. Would you like her to show you your room?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Standing inside the welcome room,
the visitor surveyed it appreciatively. The comfortable bed, the bright
furnishings. &quot;Like it?&quot; Marva asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes; indeed.&quot; Facing
her, his gray eyes examined her. She was tall, red-haired, green-eyed, and her
figure was ripe with the beauty of young womanhood. Pulling slowly at his jaw
muscles, he asked: &quot;Do you think that I resemble Cruin?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Cruin?&quot; Her finely
curved brows crinkled in puzzlement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;The commander of that alien
expedition.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Oh, him!&quot; Her eyes
laughed, and the dimples came into her cheeks. &quot;How absurd! You don't look
the least hit like him. He was old and severe. You are youngand far more
handsome.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It is kind of you to say
so,&quot; he murmured. His hands moved aimlessly around in obvious
embarrassment. He fidg­eted a little under her frank, self-possessed gaze.
Finally, he went to his pack, opened it. &quot;It is conventional for the guest
to bring his hosts a present.&quot; A tinge of pride crept into his voice.
&quot;So I have brought one. I made it myself. It took me a long time to learn
. . . a long time ... with these clumsy hands. About three years.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Marva looked at it, raced through
the doorway, leaned over the balustrade and called excitedly down the stairs.
&quot;Pop, Mom, our guest has a wonderful present for us. A clock. A clock with
a little metal bird that calls the time.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>Beneath her, feet bustled along
the passage and Mary's voice came up saying: &quot;May I see it? Please let me
see it.&quot; Eagerly, she mounted the stairs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>As he waited for them within the
welcome room, his shoulders squared, body erect as if on parade, the clock
whirred in Cruin's hands and its little bird solemnly fluted twice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>The hour of triumph.</p>

job, Finchley,&quot; he complimented. &quot;It's easy to see you have things
well in hand here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Finchley
grinned sparingly. He had a broad, hard, fiat face with tight lips and mere
slits of blue eyes. Otis had been trying ever since the previous morning to
catch a revealing expression on it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>He was uneasily
aware that his own features were too frank and open for an inspector of
colonial installations. For one thing, he had too many lines and hollows in his
face, a result of being chronically underweight from space-hopping among the
sixteen planets of the binary system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Otis noticed
that Finchley's aides were eying him furtively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes,
Finchley,&quot; he repeated to break the little silence, &quot;you're doing
very well on the hydroelectric end. When are you going to show me the capital
city you're laying out?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We can
fly over there now,&quot; answered Finchley. &quot;We have tentative boundaries
laid out below those pre-colony ruins we saw from the 'copter.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Oh, yes.
You know, I meant to remark as we flew over that they looked a good deal like
similar remnants on some of the other planets.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>He caught
himself as Finchley's thin lips tightened a trifle more. The coordinator was
obviously trying to be patient and polite to an official from whom he hoped to
get a good report, but Otis could see he would much rather be going about his
business of building up the colony.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>He could hardly
blame Finchley, he decided. It was the fifth planetary system Terrans had found
in their expansion into space, and there would be bigger jobs ahead for a man
with a record of successful accomplishments. Civilization was reaching out to
the stars at last. Otis supposed that he, too, was some sort of pioneer,
although he usually was too busy to feel like one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Well,
I'll show you some photos later,&quot; he said. &quot;Right now, we -- Say, why
all that jet-burning down there?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>In the gorge
below, men had dropped their tools and seemed to be charging toward a common
focal point Excited yells carried thinly up the cliffs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Ape hunt,
probably,&quot; guessed one of Finchley's engineers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Ape?&quot;
asked Otis, surprised.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Not
exactly,&quot; corrected Finchley patiently. &quot;That's common slang for what
we mention in reports as Torangs. They look a little like big, skinny, gray
apes; but they're the only life large enough to name after the planet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Otis stared
down into the gorge. Most of the running men had given up and were straggling
back to their work. Two or three, brandishing pistols, continued running and
disappeared around a bend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Never
catch him now,&quot; commented Finchley's pilot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Do you
just let them go running off whenever they feel like it?&quot; Otis inquired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Finchley met
his curious gaze stolidly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I'm in
favor of anything that will break the monotony, Mr. Otis. We have a problem of morale,
you know. This planet is a key colony, and I like to keep the work going
smoothly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes, I
suppose there isn't much for recreation yet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Exactly.
I don't see the sport in it myself but I let them. We're up to schedule.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Ahead, if
anything,&quot; Otis placated him. &quot;Well, now, about the city?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Finchley led
the way to the helicopter. The pilot and Otis waited while he had a final word
with his engineers, then they all climbed in and were off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Later, hovering
over the network of crude roads being leveled by Finchley's bulldozers, Otis
admitted aloud that the location was well-chosen. It lay along a long, narrow
bay that thrust in from the distant ocean to gather the waters of the same
river that was being dammed some miles upstream.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Those
cliffs over there,&quot; Finchley pointed out, &quot;were raised up since the
end of whatever civilization used to be here -- so my geologist tells me. We
can fly back that way, and you can see how the ancient city was once at the
head of the bay.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>The pilot
climbed and headed over the cliffs. Otis saw that these formed the edge of a
plateau. At one point, their continuity was marred by a deep gouge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Where the
river ran thousands of years ago,&quot; Finchley explained.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>They reached a
point from which the outlines of the ruined city were easily discerned. From
the air, Otis knew, they were undoubtedly plainer than if he had been among
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Must have
been a pretty large place,&quot; he remarked. &quot;Any idea what sort of
beings built it or what happened to them?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Haven't
had time for that yet,&quot; Finchley said. &quot;Some boys from the
exploration staff poke around in there every so often. Best current theory
seems to be that it belonged to the Torangs.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;The
animals they were hunting before?&quot; asked Otis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Might be.
Can't say for sure, but the diggers found signs the city took more of a punch
than just an earthquake. Claim they found too much evidence of fires, exploded
missiles, and warfare in general -- other places as well as here. So ... we've
been guessing the Torangs are degenerated descendents of the survivors of some
interplanetary brawl.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Otis considered
that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Sounds
plausible,&quot; he admitted, &quot;but you ought to do something to make sure
you are right.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;If it is
the case, you'll have to stop your men from hunting them; degenerated or not,
the Colonial Commission has regulations about contact with any local
inhabitants.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Finchley turned
his head to scowl at Otis, and controlled himself with an obvious effort.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Those
apes?&quot; he demanded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Well, how
can you tell? Ever try to contact them?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes! At
first, that is; before we figured them for animals.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;And?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Couldn't
get near one!&quot; Finchley declared heatedly. &quot;If they had any sort of
half-intelligent culture, wouldn't they let us make some sort of contact?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Offhand,&quot;
admitted Otis, &quot;I should think so. How about setting down a few minutes?
I'd like a look at the ruins.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Finchley glared
at his wrist watch, but directed the pilot to land at a cleared spot. The young
man brought them down neatly and the two officials alighted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Otis, glancing
around, saw where the archaeologists had been digging. They had left their
implements stacked casually at the site -- the air was dry up here and who was
there to steal a shovel</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>He left Finchley
and strolled around a mound of dirt that had been cleared away from an entrance
to one of the buildings. The latter had been built of stone, or at least faced
with it. A peep into the dim excavation led him to believe there had been a
steel framework, but the whole affair had been collapsed as if by an explosion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>He walked a
little way further and reached a section of presumably taller buildings where
the stone ruins thrust above the sandy surface. After he had wandered through
one or two arched openings that seemed to have been windows, he understood why
the explorers had chosen to dig for their information. If any covering or
decoration had ever graced the walls, it had long since been weathered off. As
for ceiling or roof, nothing remained.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Must have
been a highly developed civilization just the same,&quot; he muttered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>A movement at
one of the shadowed openings to his right caught his eye. He did not remember
noticing Finchley leave the helicopter to follow him, but he was glad of a
guide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Don't you
think so?&quot; he added.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>He turned his
head, but Finchley was not there. In fact, now that Otis was aware of his
surroundings, he could hear the voices of the other two mumbling distantly back
by the aircraft.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Seeing
things!&quot; he grumbled, and started through the ancient window.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Some instinct
stopped him half a foot outside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Come on, Jef,
he told himself, don't be silly! What could be there? Ghosts?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>On the other
hand, he realized, there were times when it was just as well to rely upon
instinct -- at least until you figured out the origin of the strange feeling.
Any spaceman would agree to that. The man who developed an animal sixth sense
was the man who lived longest on alien planets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>He thought he
must have paused a full minute or more, during which he had heard not the
slightest sound except the mutter of voices to the rear. He peered into the
chamber, which was about twenty feet square and well if not brightly lit by
reflected light.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Nothing was to
be seen, but when he found himself turning his head stealthily to peer over his
shoulder, he decided that the queer sensation along the back of his neck meant
something.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Wait, now, he
thought swiftly. I didn't see quite the whole room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>The flooring
was heaped with wind-bared rubble that would not show footprints. He felt much
more comfortable to notice himself thinking in that vein.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>At least, I'm
not imagining ghosts, he thought.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Bending forward
the necessary foot, he thrust his head through the opening and darted a quick
look to left, then to the right along the wall. As he turned right, his glance
was met directly by a pair of very wide-set black eyes which shifted inward
slightly as they got his range.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>The Torang
about matched his own six-feet-two, mainly because of elongated, gibbon-like
limbs and a similarly crouching stance. Arms and legs, covered with short,
curly, gray fur, had the same general proportions as human limbs, but looked
half again too long for a trunk that seemed to be ribbed all the way down.
Shoulder and hip joints were compactly lean, rather as if the Torang had
developed on a world of lesser gravity than that of the human.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>It was the face
that made Otis stare. The mouth was toothless and probably constructed more for
sucking than for chewing. But the eyes! They projected like ends of a dumbbell from
each side of the narrow skull where the ears should have been, and focused with
obvious mobility. Peering closer, Otis saw tiny ears below the eyes, almost
hidden in the curling fur of the neck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>He realized
abruptly that his own eyes felt as if they were bulging out, although he could
not remember having changed his expression of casual curiosity. His back was
getting stiff also. He straightened up carefully.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Uh ...
hello,&quot; he murmured, feeling unutterably silly but conscious of some
impulse to compromise between a tone of greeting for another human being and
one of pacification to an animal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>The Torang
moved then, swiftly but unhurriedly. In fact, Otis later decided, deliberately.
One of the long arms swept downward to the rubble-strewn ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>The next
instant, Otis jerked his head back out of the opening as a stone whizzed past
in front of his nose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Hey!&quot;
he protested involuntarily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>There was a
scrabbling sound from within, as of animal claws churning to a fast start among
the pebbles. Recovering his balance, Otis charged recklessly through the
entrance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I don't
know why,&quot; he admitted to Finchley a few minutes later. &quot;If I stopped
to think how I might have had my skull bashed in coming through, I guess I'd
have just backed off and yelled for you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Finchley
nodded, but his narrow gaze seemed faintly approving for the first time since
they had met.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;He was
gone, of course,&quot; Otis continued. &quot;I barely caught a glimpse of his
rump vanishing through another window.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yeah,
they're pretty fast,&quot; put in Finchley's pilot. &quot;In the time we've
been here, the boys haven't taken more than half a dozen. Got a stuffed one
over at headquarters though.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Hm-m-m,&quot;
murmured Otis thoughtfully.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>From their other
remarks, he learned that he had not noticed everything, even though face to
face with the creature. Finchley's mentioning the three digits of the hands or
feet, for instance, came as a surprise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Otis was silent
most of the flight back to headquarters. Once there, he disappeared with a
perfunctory excuse toward the rooms assigned him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>That evening,
at a dinner which Finchley had made as attractive as was possible in a
comparatively raw and new colony, Otis was noticeably sociable. The coordinator
was gratified.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Looks as
if they finally sent us a regular guy,&quot; he remarked behind his hand to one
of his assistants. &quot;Round up a couple of the prettier secretaries to keep
him happy.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I
understand he nearly laid hands on a Torang up at the diggings,&quot; said the
other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yep, ran
right at it bare-handed. Came as close to bagging it as anybody could, I
suppose.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Maybe
it's just as well he didn't,&quot; commented the assistant. &quot;They're big
enough to mess up an unarmed man some.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Otis, meanwhile
and for the rest of the evening, was assiduously busy making acquaintances. So
engrossed was he in turning every new conversation to the Torangs and asking
seemingly casual questions about the little known of their habits and possible
past, that he hardly noticed receiving any special attentions. As a visiting
inspector, he was used to attempts to entertain and distract him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>The next
morning, he caught Finchley at his office in the sprawling one-story structure
of concrete and glass that was colonial headquarters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>After accepting
a chair across the desk from the coordinator, Otis told him his conclusions.
Finchley's narrow eyes opened a trifle when he heard the details. His wide,
hard-muscled face became slightly pink.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Oh, for
-- ! I mean, Otis, why must you make something big out of it? The men very
seldom bag one anyway!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Perhaps
because they're so rare,&quot; answered Otis calmly. &quot;How do we know
they're not intelligent life? Maybe if you were hanging on in the ruins of your
ancestors' civilization, reduced to a primitive state, you'd be just as wary of
a bunch of loud Terrans moving in!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Finchley
shrugged. He looked vaguely uncomfortable, as if debating whether Otis or some
disgruntled sportsman from his husky construction crews would be easier to
handle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Think of
the overall picture a minute,&quot; Otis urged. &quot;We're pushing out into
space at last, after centuries of dreams and struggles. With all the misery
we've seen in various colonial systems at home, we've tried to plan these
ventures so as to avoid old mistakes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Finchley nodded
grudgingly. Otis could see that his mind was on the progress charts of his many
projects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It stands
to reason,&quot; the inspector went on, &quot;that some day we'll find a planet
with intelligent life. We're still new in space, but as we probe farther out,
it's bound to happen. That's why the Commission drew up rules about native life
forms. Or have you read that part of the code lately?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Finchley
shifted from side to side in his chair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Now,
look!&quot; he protested. &quot;Don't go making me out a hardboiled vandal with
nothing in mind but exterminating everything that moves on all Torang. I don't
go out hunting the apes!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I know, I
know,&quot; Otis soothed him. &quot;But before the Colonial Commission will
sanction any destruction of indigenous life, we'll have to show -- besides that
it's not intelligent -- that it exists in sufficient numbers to avoid
extinction.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;What do
you expect me to do about it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Otis regarded
him with some sympathy. Finchley was the hard-bitten type the Commission needed
to oversee the first breaking-in of a colony on a strange planet, but he was
not unreasonable. He merely wanted to be left alone to handle the tough job
facing him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Announce
a ban on hunting Torangs,&quot; Otis said. &quot;There must be something else
they can go after.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Oh,
yes,&quot; admitted Finchley. &quot;There are swarms of little rabbit-things
and other vermin running through the brush. But, I don't know -- &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;It's
standard practice,&quot; Otis reminded him. &quot;We have many a protected
species even back on Terra that would be extinct by now, only for the game laws.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>In the end,
they agreed that Finchley would do his honest best to enforce a ban provided
Otis obtained a formal order from the headquarters of the system. The inspector
went from the office straight to the communications center, where he filed a
long report for the chief coordinator's office in the other part of the binary
system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>It took some
hours for the reply to reach Torang. When it came that afternoon, he went
looking for Finchley.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>He found the
coordinator inspecting a newly finished canning factory on the coast, elated at
the completion of one more link in making the colony self-sustaining.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Here it
is,&quot; said Otis, waving the message copy. &quot;Signed by the chief
himself. 'As of this date, the apelike beings known as Torangs, indigenous to planet
number and so forth, are to be considered a rare and protected species under
regulations and so forth et cetera.' &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Good
enough,&quot; answered Finchley with an amiable shrug. &quot;Give it here, and
I'll have it put on the public address system and the bulletin boards.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Otis returned
satisfied to the helicopter that had brought him out from headquarters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Back,
sir?&quot; asked the pilot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes ...
no! Just for fun, take me out to the old city. I never did get a good look the
other day, and I'd like to before I leave.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>They flew over
the plains between the sea and the up-jutting cliffs. In the distance, Otis
caught a glimpse of the rising dam he had been shown the day before. This
colony would go well, he reflected, as long as he checked up on details like
preserving native life forms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Eventually, the
pilot landed at the same spot he had been taken on his previous visit to the
ancient ruins. Someone else was on the scene today. Otis saw a pair of men he
took to be archaeologists.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I'll just
wander around a bit,&quot; he told the pilot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>He noticed the
two men looking at him from where they stood by the shovels and other
equipment, so he paused to say hello. As he thought, they had been digging in
the ruins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Taking
some measurements in fact,&quot; said the sunburned blond introduced as
Hoffman. &quot;Trying to get a line on what sort of things built the
place.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Oh?&quot;
said Otis, interested. &quot;What's the latest theory?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Not so
much different from us,&quot; Hoffman told the inspector while his partner left
them to pick up another load of artifacts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Judging
from the size of the rooms, height of doorways, and such stuff as
stairways,&quot; he went on, &quot;they were pretty much our size. So far, of
course, it's only a rough estimate.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Could be
ancestors of the Torangs, eh?&quot; asked Otis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Very
possible, sir,&quot; answered Hoffman, with a promptness that suggested it was
his own view. &quot;But we haven't dug up enough to guess at the type of
culture they had, or draw any conclusions as to their psychology or social
customs.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Otis nodded,
thinking that he ought to mention the young fellow's name to Finchley before he
left Torang. He excused himself as the other man returned with a box of some
sort of scraps the pair had unearthed, and strolled between the outlines of the
untouched buildings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>In a few
minutes, he came to the section of higher structures where he had encountered
the Torang the previous day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Wonder if
I should look in the same spot?&quot; he muttered aloud. &quot;No ... that
would be the last place the thing would return to ... unless it had a lair
thereabouts -- &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>He stopped to
get his bearings, then shrugged and walked around a mound of rubble toward what
he believed to be the proper building.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Pretty sure
this was it, he mused. Yes, shadows around that window arch look the same ...
same time of day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>He halted,
almost guiltily, and looked back to make sure no one was observing his futile
return to the scene of his little adventure. After all, an inspector of
colonial installations was not supposed to run around ghost-hunting like a
small boy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Finding himself
alone, he stepped briskly through the crumbling arch -- and froze in his
tracks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I am
honored to know you,&quot; said the Torang in a mild, rather buzzing voice.
&quot;We thought you possibly would return here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Otis gaped. The
black eyes projecting from the sides of the narrow head tracked him up and
down, giving him the unpleasant sensation of being measured for an artillery
salvo.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I am
known as Jal-Ganyr,&quot; said the Torang. &quot;Unless I am given incorrect
data, you are known as Jeff-Otis. That is so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>The last
statement was made with almost no inflection, but some still-functioning comer
of Otis' mind interpreted it as a question. He sucked in a deep breath,
suddenly conscious of having forgotten to breathe for a moment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I didn't
know ... yes, that is so ... I didn't know you Torangs could speak Terran. Or
anything else. How -- ?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>He hesitated as
a million questions boiled up in his mind to be asked. Jal-Ganyr absently
stroked the gray fur of his chest with his three-fingered left hand, squatting
patiently on a flat rock. Otis felt somehow that he had been allowed to waste
time mumbling only by grace of disciplined politeness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I am not
of the Torangs,&quot; said Jal-Ganyr in his wheezing voice. &quot;I am of the
Myrbs. You would possibly say Myrbii. I have not been informed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You mean
that is your name for yourselves?&quot; asked Otis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Jal-Ganyr
seemed to consider, his mobile eyes swiveling inward to scan the Terran's face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;More than
that,&quot; he said at last, when he had thought it over. &quot;I mean I am of
the race originating at Myrb, not of this planet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Before we
go any further,&quot; insisted Otis, &quot;tell me, at least, how you learned
our language!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Jal-Ganyr made
a fleeting gesture. His &quot;face&quot; was unreadable to the Terran, but Otis
had the impression he had received the equivalent of a smile and a shrug.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;As to
that,&quot; said the Myrb, &quot;I possibly learned it before you did. We have
observed you a very long time. You would unbelieve how long.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;But then
-- &quot; Otis paused. That must mean before the colonists had landed on this
planet. He was half-afraid it might mean before they had reached this sun
system. He put aside the thought and asked, &quot;But then, why do you live
like this among the ruins? Why wait till now? If you had communicated, you
could have had our help rebuilding -- &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>He let his voice
trail off, wondering what sounded wrong. Jal-Ganyr rolled his eyes about
leisurely, as if disdaining the surrounding ruins. Again, he seemed to consider
all the implications of Otis' questions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We picked
up your message to your chief,&quot; he answered at last. &quot;We decided time
is to communicate with one of you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;We have
no interest in rebuilding,&quot; he added. &quot;We have concealed quarters for
ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Otis found that
his lips were dry from his unconsciously having let his mouth hang open. He
moistened them with the tip of his tongue, and relaxed enough to lean against
the wall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;You mean
my getting the ruling to proclaim you a protected species?&quot; he asked.
&quot;You have instruments to intercept such signals?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I do. We
have,&quot; said Jal-Ganyr simply. &quot;It has been decided that you have
expanded far enough into space to make necessary we contact a few of the
thoughtful among you. It will possibly make easier in the future for our
observers.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Otis wondered
how much of that was irony. He felt himself flushing at the memory of the
&quot;stuffed specimen&quot; at headquarters, and was peculiarly relieved that
he had not gone to see it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>I've had the
luck, he told himself. I'm the one to discover the first known intelligent
beings beyond Sol!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Aloud, he said,
&quot;We expected to meet someone like you eventually. But why have you chosen
me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>The question
sounded vain, he realized, but it brought unexpected results.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Your
message. You made in a little way the same decision we made in a big way. We
deduce that you are one to understand our regret and shame at what happened
between our races ... long ago.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;Yes. For
a long time, we thought you were all gone. We are pleased to see you returning
to some of your old planets.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Otis stared
blankly. Some instinct must have enabled the Myrb to interpret his bewildered
expression. He apologized briefly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;I
possibly forgot to explain the ruins.&quot; Again, Jal-Ganyr's eyes swiveled
slowly about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>&quot;They are
not ours,&quot; he said mildly. &quot;They are yours.&quot;</p>

lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'>PROFESSOR VLADIMIR ROJESTVENSKY, IT
HAS SINCE BEEN LEARNED, remade the world at breakfast one morning while eating
a bowl of rather watery red-cabbage soup, with black bread on the side. It is
now a matter of history that the soup was not up to par that day, and the black
bread in Omsk all that week was sub-marginal. But neither of these factors is
considered to have contributed to the remaking of civilization.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The essential thing was that, while blowing on
a spoonful of red-cabbage soup, Professor Rojestvensky happened to think of an
interesting inference or deduction to be drawn from the Bramwell-Weems Equation
expressing the distribution of energy among the nucleus-particles of the
lighter atoms. The Bramwell-Weems Equation was known in Russia as the Gabrilovitch-Brekhov
Formula because, obviously, Russians must have thought of it first. The
symbols, however, were the same as in the capitalist world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Professor Rojestvensky contemplated the
inference with pleasure. It was very interesting indeed. He finished his
breakfast, drank a glass of hot tea, wrapped himself up warmly, and set out for
his classrooms in the University of Omsk. It was a long walk, because the
streetcars were not running. It was a fruitful one, though. For as he walked,
Professor Rojestvensky arranged his reasoning in excellent order. When he
arrived at the University he found a directive from the Council of Soviet
Representatives for Science and Culture. It notified him that from now on
Soviet scientists must produce more and better and more Earth-shaking
discoveries--or else. Therefore he would immediately report, in quadruplicate,
what first-rank discoveries he was prepared to make in the science of physics.
And they had better be good.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He was a modest man, was Professor
Rojestvensky, but to fail to obey the directive meant losing his job. So he
quakingly prepared a paper outlining his extension of the Bramwell-Weems
Equation--but he was careful to call it the Gabrilovitch-Brekhov Formula--and
persuaded one of his students to make four copies of it in exchange for a
quarter of a pound of cheese. Then he sent off the four copies and slept badly
for weeks afterward. He knew his work was good, but he didn't know whether it
was good enough. It merely accounted for the mutual repulsion of the molecules
of gases, it neatly explained the formation of comets' tails, and it could have
led to the prediction of clouds of calcium vapor-already observed--in
interstellar space. Professor Rojestvensky did not guess he had remade the
world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Weeks passed, and nothing happened. That was a
bad month in Russian science. The staffs of Medical Research and Surgical
Advancement had already reported everything they could dream up. Workers in
Aerodynamic Design weren't sticking out their necks. The last man to design a
new plane went to prison for eight years when a fuel line clogged on his
plane's test flight. And Nuclear Fission workers stuck to their policy of
demanding unobtainable equipment and supplies for the furtherance of their
work. So Professor Rojestvensky's paper was absolutely the only contribution
paddable to Earth-shaking size. His paper itself was published in the Soviet
Journal of Advanced Science. Then it was quoted unintelligibly in Pravda and
Tass, with ecstatic editorials pointing out how far Russian science was ahead
of mere capitalist-imperialistic research. And that was that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Possibly that would have been the end of it
all, but that some two weeks later an American jet bomber flew twelve thousand
miles, dropped fifteen tons of simulated bombs--actually condensed milk lowered
to Earth by parachutes--and returned to base without refueling. This, of
course, could not be allowed to go unchallenged. So a stern directive went to
Aerodynamic Design. An outstanding achievement in aviation must be produced
immediately. It must wipe the Americans' decadent, capitalistic eyes. Or--so
the directive said explicitly--else.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The brain trust which was Aerodynamic Design
went into sweating executive session, seeking a really air-tight procedure for
passing the buck. They didn't want to lose their jobs, which were fairly fat
ones, any more than Professor Rojestvensky had. They had to cook up something
in a hurry, something really dramatic, with an out putting the blame squarely
on somebody else if it didn't work. They couldn't blame Aviation Production,
though. The head of that splendid organization had an in with the Politbureau.
Something new and drastic and good was needed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>In the end a desperate junior official began
to hunt through recent Soviet contributions to science. If he could find
something impressive that could be twisted into an advance in aerodynamics, it
could be designed and built, and any failure blamed on the scientist who had
furnished false data as a form of alien-inspired sabotage. Scientists were
always expendable in Russian politics. It was time to expend one. Largely
because his name was on top of the pile, Professor Rojestvensky was picked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>This, in detail, is the process by which his
extension of the Bramwell-Weems or Gabrilovitch-Brekhov--Equation was selected
for practical development. Our brave new world is the result. Aerodynamic
Design borrowed a man from Nuclear Fission in a deal between two department
heads, and the Nuclear Fission man agreed to work up something elaborate and impressive.
He set to work on Professor Rojestvensky's figures. And presently he turned
pale, and gulped very rapidly several times, and muttered, &quot;Gospody
pomilovl&quot; That meant, &quot;Lord have mercy on us!&quot; and it was not a
good Russian expression any longer, but it was the way he felt. In time, he
showed his results to Aerodynamic Design and said, in effect, &quot;But, it
might really work!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Aerodynamic Design sent him out to Omsk to get
Professor Rojestvensky to check his calculations. It was a shrewd move. The Nuclear
Fission man and Professor Rojestvensky got along splendidly. They ate
red-cabbage soup together and the professor O.K.'d the whole project. That made
him responsible for anything that went wrong and Aerodynamic Design, en masse,
was much relieved. They sent in a preliminary report on their intentions and
started to make one gadget themselves. The Nuclear Fission man was strangely
willing to play along and see what happened. He supervised the construction of
the thing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>It consisted of a set of straps very much like
a parachute harness, hung from a little bar of brass with a plating of metallic
sodium, under another plating of nickel, and the whole thing inclosed in a
plastic tube. There was a small box with a couple of controls. That was all
there was to it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>When it was finished, the Nuclear-Fission man
tried it out himself. He climbed into the harness in the Wind Tunnel Building
of Aerodynamic Design's plant, said the Russian equivalent of &quot;Here goes
nothing!&quot; and flipped over one of the controls. In his shakiness, he
pushed it too far. He left the ground, went straight up like a rocket, and
cracked his head against the three-story-high ceiling and was knocked cold for
two hours. They had to haul him down from the ceiling with an extension ladder,
because the gadget he'd made tried insistently to push a hole through the roof
to the wide blue yonder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>When he recovered consciousness, practically
all of Aerodynamic Design surrounded him, wearing startled expressions. And
they stayed around while he found out what the new device would do. Put
briefly, it would do practically anything but make fondant. It was a personal
flying device, not an airplane, which would lift up to two hundred twenty-five
pounds. It would hover perfectly. It would, all by itself, travel in any
direction at any speed a man could stand without a windshield.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>True, the Rojestvensky Effect which made it
fly was limited. No matter how big you made the metal bar, it wouldn't lift
more than roughly a hundred kilos, nearly two-twenty-five pounds. But it worked
by the fact that the layer of metallic sodium on the brass pushed violently
away from all other sodium more than three meters away from it. Sodium within
three meters wasn't affected. And there was sodium everywhere. Sodium
chloride--common table salt--is present everywhere on Earth and the waters
under the Earth, but it isn't present in the heavens above. So the thing would
fly anywhere over land or sea, but it wouldn't go but so high. The top limit
for the gadget's flight was about four thousand feet, with a
hundred-and-fifty-pound man in the harness. A heavier man couldn't get up so
high. And it was infinitely safe. A man could fly night, day, or blind drunk
and nothing could happen to him. He couldn't run into a mountain because he'd bounce
over it. The thing was marvelous!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

report to the Politbureau. A new and appropriately revolutionary device--it was
Russian-had been produced in obedience to orders. Russian science had come
through! When better revolutionary discoveries were made, Russia would make
them! And if the device was inherently limited to one-man use-ha-ha! It gave
the Russian army flying infantry! It provided the perfect modern technique for
revolutionary v.ar! It offered the perfect defense for peaceful, democratic
Russia against malevolent capitalistic imperialism! In short, it was hot stuff!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

there was a May Day celebration in Moscow at which the proof of Russia's
superlative science was unveiled to the world. Planes flew over Red Square in
magnificent massed formations. Tanks and guns rumbled through the streets
leading to Lenin's tomb. But the infantry--where was the infantry? Where were
the serried ranks of armed men, shaking the earth with their steady tread?
Behind the tanks and guns there was only emptiness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the city to enthusiasm. Far, far away, the flying infantry appeared!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

believed at first that the U.S.S.R. had made a nonaggression pact with God and
that a detachment of angels was parading in compliment to the Soviet Union. It
wasn't too implausible, as a first impression. Shoulder to shoulder, rank after
rank, holding fast to lines like dog leashes that held them in formation, no
less than twelve thousand Russian infantrymen floated into the Red Square some
fifteen feet off the ground. They were a bit ragged as to elevation, and they
tended to eddy a bit at street corners, but they swept out of the canyons which
were streets at a magnificent twenty-five miles an hour, in such a display of
air-borne strength as the world had never seen before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

European nations. These pacts of closest friendship were going to be honeys!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

remade the world. But that great events were in the making was self-evident
even to members of the United States Senate. Newsreel pictures of the flying
infantry parade were shown everywhere. And the Communist parties of the Western
nations were, of course, wholly independent organizations with no connection
whatever with Moscow. But they could not restrain their enthusiasm over this
evidence of Russian greatness. Cheering sections of Communists attended every
showing of the newsreels in every theater and howled themselves hoarse. They
took regular turns at it and were supplied with throat lozenges by ardent Party
workers. Later newsreels showing the flying infantry returning to camp over the
rooftops of Moscow evoked screams of admiration. When a Russian documentary
film appeared in the Western world, skillfully faking the number of men
equipped with individual flying units, the national, patriotic Communist party
members began to mention brightly that everybody who did not say loudly, at regular

thousand miles last week, and we've done pretty good work for the Agriculture
Department dusting grasshoppers.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The other was the bitter protest made by the
Russian ambassador in Washington. He denounced the capitalist-economy-inspired
prevention of the shipment to Russia of an order for brass rods plated with
metallic sodium, then plated with nickel, and afterward inclosed in plastic
tubes. State Department investigation showed that while an initial order of
twelve thousand five hundred such rods had been shipped in April, there had been
a number of fires in the factory since, and it had been closed down until
fire-prevention methods could be devised. It was pointed out that metallic
sodium is hot stuff. It catches fire when wetted or even out of pure cussedness
it is fiercely inflammable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>This was a fact that Aviation Production in
Russia had already found out. The head man was in trouble with his own friends
in the Politbureau for failing to meet production quotas, and he'd ordered the
tricky stuff--the rods had to be dipped in melted sodium in a helium atmosphere
for quantity production--manufactured in the benighted and scientifically
retarded United States.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>There was another item that should be
mentioned, too. Within a week after the issue of personal fliers to Russian
infantrymen, no less than sixty-four desertions by air to Western nations took
place. On the morning after the first night maneuvers of the air-borne force,
ninety-two Russians were discovered in the Allied half of Germany alone, trying
to swap their gadgets for suits of civilian clothes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>They were obliged, of course. Enterprising
black marketeers joyfully purchased the personal fliers, shipped them to
France, to Holland, to Belgium, Sweden, Norway, and Switzerland, and sold them
at enormous profits. In a week it was notorious that any Russian deserter from
the flying infantry could sell his flight-equipment for enough money to buy
forty-nine wrist watches and still stay drunk for six months. It was typical
private enterprise. It was unprincipled and unjust. But it got worse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Private entrepreneurs stole the invention
itself. At first the units were reproduced one by one in small shops for high
prices. But the fire-hazard was great. Production-line methods were really
necessary both for economy and industrial safety reasons. So after a while the
Bofors Company, of Sweden, rather apologetically turned out a sport model, in
quantity, selling for kronen worth twelve dollars and fifty cents in American
money. Then the refurbished<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>G. Farben
put out a German type which sold openly for a sum in occupation marks equal to
only nine eighty American. A Belgian model priced--in francs--at five fifty had
a wide sale, but was not considered quite equal to the Dutch model at guilders
exchanging for six twenty-five or the French model with leather-trimmed straps
at seven dollars worth of devaluated francs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The United States capitalists started late.
Two bicycle makers switched their factories to the production of personal
fliers, yet by the middle of June American production was estimated at not over
fifty thousand per month. But in July, one hundred eighty thousand were
produced and in August the production--expected to be about three hundred
thousand --suddenly went sky-high when both General Electric and Westinghouse
entered the market. In September American production was over three million and
it became evident that manufacturers would have to compete with each other on
finish and luxury of design. The days when anything that would fly was salable
at three fifty and up were over.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The personal flier became a part of American
life, as, of course, it became a part of life everywhere. In the United States
the inherent four-thousand-foot ceiling of personal fliers kept regular air
traffic from having trouble except near airports, and flier-equipped airport
police soon developed techniques for traffic control. A blimp patrol had to be
set up off the Atlantic Coast to head back enthusiasts for foreign travel and
Gulf Stream fishing, but it worked very well. There were three million, then five
million, and by November twelve million personal-flier-equipped Americans
aloft. And the total continued to rise. Suburban railways--especially after
weather-proof garments became really good--joyfully abandoned their short-haul
passenger traffic and all the railroads settled down contentedly to their real
and profitable business of long-haul heavy-freight carriage. Even the air lines
prospered incredibly. The speed-limitation on personal fliers still left the
jet-driven plane the only way to travel long distances quickly, and passengers
desiring intermediate stops simply stepped out of a plane door when near their
desired destination. Rural residential developments sprang up like mushrooms. A
marked trend toward country life multiplied, Florida and California became so
crowded that everybody got disgusted and went home, and the millennium appeared
to be just around the corner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Then came the dawn. It was actually the dawn
of the remade world, but it looked bad for a while. The Soviet government
stormed at the conscienceless, degraded theft of its own State secret by
decadent and imperialistic outsiders. Actual Russian production of personal
fliers was somewhere around twenty-five hundred per month at a time when half
the population of Europe and America had proved that flying was cheaper than
walking. Sternly, the Soviet government--through the Cominform --suggested that
now was the time for all good Communists to come to the aid of their Party. The
Party needed personal fliers. Fast. So enthusiastic Communists all over Europe
flew loyally to Russia to contribute to the safety of their ideals, and to
prove the international solidarity of the proletariat. They landed by tens of
thousands without passports, without ration cards, and often with insufficient Party
credentials. They undoubtedly had spies among them, along with noble comrades.
So the U.S.S.R. had to protect itself. Regretfully, Russian officials clapped
the new arrivals into jail as they landed, took away their fliers, and sent
them back to their national borders in box cars. But they did send
indoctrination experts to travel with them and explain that this was hospitable
treatment and that they were experiencing the welcome due to heroes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>But borders were not only crossed by friends.
Smuggling became a sport. Customs barriers for anything but heavy goods simply
ceased to exist. The French national monopoly on tobacco and matches
evaporated, and many Frenchmen smoked real tobacco for the first time in their
lives. Some of them did not like it. And there were even political consequences
of the personal-flier development. In Spain, philosophical anarchists and
syndicalistos organized political demonstrations. Sometimes hundreds of them
flew all night long to rendezvous above the former royal palace in Madrid--now
occupied by the Caudillo--and empty chamber-pots upon it at dawn.
Totalitarianism in Spain collapsed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The Russian rulers were made of sterner stuff.
True, the Iron Curtain became a figment. Political refugees from Russia
returned--sometimes thoughtfully carrying revolvers in case they met somebody
they disliked-and disseminated capitalistic propaganda and cast doubts upon the
superiority of the Russian standard of living. Often they had wrist watches and
some of them even brought along personal fliers as gifts to personal friends.
Obviously, this sort of thing was subversive. The purity of Soviet culture
could not be maintained when foreigners could enter Russia at will and call the
leaders of the Soviet Union liars. Still less could it survive when they proved
it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>So the Soviet Union fought back. The Army set
up radars to detect the carriers of anti-dialectic-materialism propaganda. The
Ministry of Propaganda worked around the clock. People wearing wrist watches
were shot if they could not prove they had stolen them from Germans, and
smugglers and young men flying Sovietward to ply Russian girls with chocolate
bars were intercepted. For almost a week it seemed that radar and flying
infantry might yet save the Soviet way of life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>But then unprincipled capitalists dealt a new
foul blow. They advertised that anybody intending to slip through the Iron
Curtain should provide himself with Bouffon's Anti-Radar Tin Foil Strips,
available in one-kilogram cartons at all corner shops. Tin foil strips had been
distributed by Allied bombers to confuse German radar during the last war.
Smugglers and romantic young men, meditatively dripping tin foil as they flew
through the Russian night, made Russian radar useless.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Nothing was left but war. So a splendid, overwhelming
blow was planned and carried out. In two nights the entire Soviet force of
flying infantry was concentrated. On the third night four hundred thousand
flying infantry went sweeping westward in an irresistible swarm. The technique
had been worked out by the General Staff on orders from the Politbureau to
devise immediately a new and unbeatable system of warfare--or else. The horde
of flying warriors was to swoop down from the darkness on Western European
cities, confiscate all personal fliers and ship them back to Russia for the use
of reinforcements. There could be no resistance. Every part of an enemy nation
was equally reachable and equally vulnerable. Russian troops could not be
bombed, because they would be deliberately intermixed with the native
population. There could be no fighting but street-fighting. This would be war
on a new scale, invasion from a new dimension; it would be conquest which could
not be fought.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The only trouble was that practically every
square mile of European sky was inhabited by somebody enjoying the fruits of
Russian science in the form of a personal flier. And secrecy simply couldn't be
managed. All Europe knew just about as much about the Russian plan as the
Russians did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>So when the clouds of flying infantry came pouring
through the night, great droning bombers with riding-lights and landing-lights
aglow came roaring out of the west to meet them. There were, to be sure, Soviet
jet-fighters with the defending fleet. They tangled with the Russian escort and
fought all over the sky, while the bombers focused their landing-lights on the
infantry and roared at them. The sensation of being ahead of a bellowing plane
rushing at one was exactly that of being on a railroad track with an express
train on the loose. There was nothing to do but duck. The Russian soldiers
ducked. Then the bombers began to shoot star shells, rockets, Roman candles and
other pyrotechnics. The Russian troops dispersed. And an army that is dispersed
simply isn't an army. When finally vast numbers of enthusiastic personal-flier
addicts came SwOoping through the night with flashlights and Very pistols, the
debacle was complete. The still-fighting planes overhead had nothing left to
fight for. Those that were left went home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>When dawn came the Russian soldiers were
individuals scattered over three separate nations. And Russian soldiers, in
quantity, tend to fight or loot as opportunity offers. But a Russian soldier,
as an individual, craves civilian clothes above all else. Russian soldiers
landed and tried to make deals for their flying equipment according to the
traditions of only a few months before. They were sadly disillusioned. The best
bargain most of them could make was simply a promise that they wouldn't be sent
back home--and they took that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>It was all rather anticlimactic, and it got
worse. Russia was still legally at war with everybody, even after its flying
infantry sat down and made friends. And Russia was still too big to invade. On
the other hand, it had to keep its air force in hand to fight off attempts at
invasion. Just to maintain that defensive frame of mind, Allied bombers
occasionally smashed some Russian airfields, and some railroads, and--probably
at the instigation of decadent capitalists--they did blow up the Aviation
Production factories, even away off in the Urals. Those Ural raids, by the way,
were made by the United States Air Force, flying over the North Pole to prove
that it could deliver something besides condensed milk at long distances.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>But the war never really amounted to much. The
Allies had all the flying infantry they wanted to use, but they didn't want to
use it. The Russians worked frantically, suborning treason and developing black
marketeers and so on, to get personal fliers for defense, but Russian civilians
would pay more than even the Soviet government for them, so the Army hardly got
any at all. To correct this situation the Supreme Soviet declared private
possession of a personal flier a capital offense, and shot several hundred
citizens to prove it. Among the victims of this purge, by the way, was the
Nuclear-Fission man who had worked out the personal flier from Professor
Rojestvensky's figures. But people wanted personal fliers. When owning one
became a reason for getting shot, almost half the Russian government's minor
officials piled out of the nearest window and went somewhere else, and the
bigger officials kept their personal fliers where they could grab them at any
instant and take off. And the smuggling kept on. Before long practically
everybody had private fliers but the army--and flier-equipped soldiers tended
to disappear over the horizon if left alone after nightfall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>So the Soviet Union simply fell to pieces. The
Supreme Soviet couldn't govern when anybody who disagreed with it could go up
the nearest chimney and stay gone. It lost the enthusiastic support of the
population as soon as it became unable to shoot the unenthusiastic. And when it
was committed to the policy of shooting every Russian citizen who possessed
proof of the supreme splendor of Russian science--a personal flier--why public
discipline disappeared. Party discipline went with it. All discipline followed.
And when there wasn't any discipline there simply wasn't any Soviet Union and
therefore there wasn't any war, and everybody might as well stop fooling around
and cook dinner. The world, in fact, was remade.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Undoubtedly the world is a good deal happier
since Professor Rojestvensky thought of an interesting inference to be drawn
from the Bramwell-Weems Equation while at his breakfast of red-cabbage soup and
black bread. There are no longer any iron-bound national boundaries, and
therefore no wars or rumors of wars. There are no longer any particular reasons
for cities to be crowded, and a reasonably equitable social system has to exist
or people will go fishing or down to the South Seas, or somewhere where they
won't be bothered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>But in some ways the change has not been as
great as one might have expected. About a year after the world was remade, an
American engineer thought up a twist on Professor Rojestvensky's figures. He
interested the American continental government and they got ready to build a
spaceship. The idea was that if a variation of that brass-sodium-nickel bar was
curled around a hundred-foot-long tube, and metallic sodium vapor was
introduced into one end of the tube, it would be pushed out of the other end
with some speed. Calculation proved, indeed, that with all the acceleration
possible, the metallic vapor would emerge with a velocity of ninety-eight point
seven percent of the speed of light. Using Einstein's formula for the
relationship of mass to speed, that meant that the tube would propel a
rocket-ship that could go to the Moon or Mars or anywhere else. The American
government started to build the ship, and then thought it would be a good idea
to have Professor Rojestvensky in on the job as a consultant. Besides, the
world owed him something. So he was sent for, and Congress voted him more money
than he had ever heard of before, and he looked over the figures and O.K.'d
them. They were all right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>But he was typical of the people whose
happiness has not been markedly increased by the remade world. He was a rich
man, and he liked America, but after a month or so he didn't look happy. So the
government put him in the most luxurious suite in the most luxurious hotel in
America, and assigned people to wait on him and a translator to translate for
him, and did its very best to honor the man who'd remade the world. But still
he didn't seem content.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>One day a committee of reporters asked him
what he wanted. He would be in all the history books, and he had done the world
a great favor, and the public would like him to be pleased. But Professor
Rojestvensky shook his head sadly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'><span
lang=EN-CA style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;It's only,&quot; he said gloomily,
&quot;that since I am rich and the world is peaceable and everybody is
happy--well, I just can't seem to find anyone who knows how to make good
red-cabbage soup.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
