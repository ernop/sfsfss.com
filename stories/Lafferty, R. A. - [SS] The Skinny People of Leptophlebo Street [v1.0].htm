money was very tight. There were those who said that money might be got in

leaf in front of him, and on the leaf there were seven filbert nuts and two
almonds. The monkey pointed the man out to Canute and Canute to the man and he
said, “Kmee-fee-eee-eee-eee.” Then he skittered away.</span></p>

Hiram said. “I received twelve filbert nuts on consignment this morning and I
have already sold five of them. With my markup, this gives me enough equity in
filberts that I can eat one myself and still have enough cash on hand to cover
those sold. This is known as eating free, and it is the first rule of economic
independence. As to the almond nuts, I own them outright. I started the day
with five of them and I have sold three for cash. This is the best sales record
that I can remember, up to this time of day, for almonds. I also own the pandanus
leaf. That being so, I am almost insulated against misfortune. If I sell
nothing for the rest of the day it will still not be a complete catastrophe.”</span></p>

skinny people of Leptophlebo Street, wore a very large, flat, wide-brimmed hat

Hiram really wore on top of his head was a growing vegetable and fruit and
grain garden. And all those garden-hats were tilted to catch all the sun

thinking on the same scale,” Canute said dourly. “I need eighty-five thousand
dollars for an opportune deal, such a deal as will come only once in my life. I
need the sum at no more than seven percent interest and I need it today. Yes,
my acquaintance in this city must be a humorist.”</span></p>

Mr. Poorlode,” a small boy said, and he set a good-looking pair of smooth shoes
down beside Hiram. “He will not need them again for two hours, but he believes
that Mr. Shortribs may want them before that.”</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“Thank you, Piet,” Hiram said,
and the boy skipped off. “That is Piet,” Hiram told Canute, “the son of Jan
Thingruel who gathers more astatic grain out of cracks than does anyone else on
the street. We have but one pair of shoes here, and whatever person goes to
make a prestigious visit will wear the shoes. They fit all persons in the
street, since Claude Halfgram had the finial joints of four of his toes removed
last year. They are good shoes and we take excellent care of them. I am shoe
custodian this week.” Hiram Poorlode lifted up one of the flagstones of the
street and put the shoes down into a shoehole that was underneath it.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“I have the money by me now,”
Hiram said then. “Nothing is easier than eighty-five thousand dollars in gold.
And, with me, a man’s face is his security. Give me half an hour to consider
you, for I am a cautious man. Spend the time pleasantly: visit and observe our
rather odd Leptophlebo Street here. Enjoy yourself, sir, and be assured that
your case is under active consideration. I can tell a lot about a man by
watching how he reacts to Leptophlebo Street.”</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“All right,” Canute said. “I’d
given up hope of raising the money anyhow. Money is tight this season. Ah, but
it was a sweet, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! Yes, it’s an odd little street
here. How much do you sell the filberts for?”</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span

standard coin of the street. One tenth of a cent.”</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>One
might as well enjoy the drollery. Really, Canute had never seen anything quite
like Leptophlebo Street; never such skinny monkeys or such skinny people. There
were mysteries about the relationship of the monkeys and the people. The
monkeys couldn’t talk properly. There’s an old saying that whenever monkeys<i>
do</i> talk there’s some monkey business going on. Well, there was plenty of it
going on here, but all that the monkeys could say was “Kmee-fee-eee-eee-eee.”
The monkeys wrote notes on little pieces of paper and gave them to the merchants
of the street. They brought in fruit and they traded it or sold it. From the
merchants they bought a few nuts that were out of season in the woods, bought
them for clay coins or in trade for their in-season fruits or nuts. The people
asked the monkeys about their families and about the situation in the woods,
and the monkeys wrote the answers on little pieces of paper.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“The monkeys are so smart,”
Canute said, “that it seems as if they could talk. As long as you are doing
business with them anyhow, you could teach them speech.”</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“People of the monkey caste are
not allowed to talk,” Effie Poorlode said. (She was the wife of Hiram the nut
merchant.) “Everyone has his niche in the world, and the monkeys don’t have
talking niches. And it would be no profit to us to teach them speech. We have
plenty of time to wait for them to write out their notes, and we do make a good
profit on the paper that they write them on.”</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>The people of Leptophlebo Street
were the skinniest folks that Canute had ever seen. How the ribs stood out on
them! Two ribby young ladies were in a booth down the street.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span

the monkeys?” Canute asked Effie Poorlode.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“Get your teeth cleaned free,
sir!” the boy Marquis Shortribs was soliciting a passer-by. “My father does
excellent tooth cleaning free.” But the passer-by continued on.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“Oh, there will always be
customers,” Effie told him. “Suppose that ten thousand persons go by and do not
avail themselves of this service. But then the very next person might stop at
the Shortribs’ booth, and you can see how that would make all the waiting and
solicitation worthwhile. As to your question, no, we don’t sell the pieces of
paper to the monkeys. The monkeys make the paper in the woods, and they make
the ink too. They write their notes on the paper and they give them to us. You
can see that the profit will be enormous. If we get only eight or ten of these
little pieces of paper a day, look how they will count up. We dissolve the ink
off the paper, and when we have a thousand pounds of the ink we can sell it to
the ink bottlers or pen makers of the city.”</span></p>

Shortribs cleans, do you realize just how superorganic are the deposits taken

gold and that it reproduces itself, that it all comes from two nuggets that got
together under the flagstones.”</span></p>

there. There is bar gold and ingot gold. And there is coined gold of various
coinages,” Canute protested. Hiram had already removed the stones that covered
the gold in the street.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Droid Sans","sans-serif"'>“Yes,” Hiram agreed, “several
pairs of different forms of rabbit gold would be required, wouldn’t they? Then
there’s the story that it’s all monkey gold. The monkeys find it and refine it
in the woods. Then they give it to us noble burghers of the street. They are
afraid to keep it. It is said that they did keep it when they were men, and
that that’s what made monkeys out of them. You don’t believe that entirely? Oh,
I see that Hoxie has been monkey-lacing my act behind my back.” And Hoxie had
been doing that. But had he been saying “Do not believe all of it” with his
monkey-lacing, or had he been saying “Do not believe any of it”?</span></p>

all pound-of-flesh gold,” Hiram said. “This legend states that we sell pounds
of flesh for the yearly bashes of the Extortioners’ Guild and the Hatchet
Makers’ Guild and especially for that dread secret society Glomerule; and that
we receive our gold for the pounds of flesh. Ah, there it is, Canute, all ready
