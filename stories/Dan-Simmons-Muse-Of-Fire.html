<p>&nbsp;writer of considerable power, range, and ambition,
an eclectic talent not willing to be restricted to any one genre, Dan
Simmons sold his first story to <em>The Twilight Zone Magazine</em>
in 1982. By the end of that decade, he had become one of the most
popular and bestselling authors in both the horror and the science
fiction genres, winning, for instance, both the Hugo Award for his epic
science fiction novel <em>Hyperion</em> and the Bram
Stoker Award for his huge horror novel <em>Carrion Comfort</em>
in the <em>same year,</em> 1990. He has continued to split
his output since between science fiction <em>(The Fall of
Hyperion, The Hollow Man)</em> and horror <em>(Song of
Kali, Summer of Night, Chil&shy;dren of the Night)&hellip;</em>
although a few of his novels are downright unclassifiable <em>(Phases
of Gravity,</em> for instance, which is a straight literary novel
although it was published as part of a science fiction line), and some
(like <em>Children of the Night)</em> could be
legitimately considered to be either science fiction or horror,
depending on how you squint at them. Similarly, his first collection, <em>Prayers
to Broken Stones,</em> contains a mix of science fiction,
fantasy, horror, and &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; stories, as does
his most recent collection, <em>Lovedeath.</em> Some of
his most recent books confirm his reputation for unpredictability,
includ&shy;ing <em>The Crook Factory,</em> a spy
thriller set in World War II and starring Ernest Hemingway; <em>Darwin&rsquo;s
Blade,</em> a &ldquo;statistical thriller&rdquo; halfway
between mystery and horror; <em>Hardcase,</em> a
hard-boiled detective novel; and <em>A Winter Haunting,</em>
a ghost story. Coming up is a new novel, <em>The Terror.</em>
Born in Peoria, Illinois, Simmons now lives with his family in Colorado.</p>

<p>Simmons has established himself as a force to be reckoned with
in the New Space Opera with his glittering, baroque <em>Hyperion</em>
novels, and his two most recent novels, <em>Ilium</em> and
<em>Olympus,</em> which use the Trojan War as the backdrop
for an ambitious space opera duology. In the complex and multi-faceted
novella that follows, he takes us on a journey of unparalleled scope
and scale, in company with a hapless group of actors who find
themselves burdened with the responsibility of putting on the single
most important theatrical performance in human history&hellip;</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>I sometimes think that none of the rest of the things would
have hap&shy;pened if we hadn&rsquo;t performed the Scottish
Play that night at Mezel-Goull. Nothing good ever comes from putting on
the Scottish Play&mdash;if we remember any history at all, we know
that&mdash;and much bad often does.</p>

<p>But I doubt if there have ever been ramifications like this
before.</p>

<p>The <em>Muse of Fire</em> followed the Archon
funeral barge out of the Pleroma into the Kenoma, slipped out of its
pleromic wake like a newborn emerg&shy;ing from a caul, and made
its own weak-fusion way to our next stop on the tour, a world known
only as 25-25-261B. I&rsquo;d been there before. By this time,
I&rsquo;d been with the Earth&rsquo;s Men long enough to have
visited all of the four hundred or so worlds we were allowed to tour
regularly. They say that there are over ten thousand worlds in the
Tell&mdash;ten thousand we humans have been scattered to, I
mean&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll never know if that&rsquo;s true. <em>We&rsquo;ll</em>
never know.</p>

<p>I always love the way the <em>Muse</em> roars
down through cloud and sky on her thundering three-mile-long pillar of
fire, especially at night, and the descent to the arbeiter community on
the coastal plateau below the Archon keep of Mezel-Goull was no
disappointment.</p>

<p>We landed on the inner edge of the great stone shelf
separating the human villages from the acid-tossed sea cliffs. One
glance at the <em>Muse&rsquo;s</em> log had reminded
me that 25-25-261B had only three variations in its day and weather:
twilight-bright dimness and scalding spray blown in by winds from the
crashing black ocean of sulfuric acid for fourteen hours each day;
twilight-bright dimness and sandstorms blown to the barely habitable
coasts by hot winds from the interior of the continent for another
fourteen hours each day; and full darkness when no winds blew for the
final four&shy;teen hours. The air was breathable
here&mdash;all of our tour worlds had that in common, of course,
since we only travel to planets where the Archons keep arbeiter and
dole slaves&mdash;but even in the middle of their twenty-one hours
of daytime on this bleak rock, the sky brightened to only a dim,
brooding grayness because of the constant layers of clouds, and no one
ventured out unprotected during the hours when the scalding spray blew
in from the black, sulfuric sea.</p>

<p>The <em>Muse</em> touched down during the hours
the hot <em>simoom</em> winds blew. No one came out from
the huddled stone city to meet us. The thousands of arbeiters were
either sleeping in their barracks between shifts or work&shy;ing in
the mines, dropping down to darkness in rusty buckets and then
following veins miles deeper underground to harvest a gray fungus that
the Archons considered a delicacy. The few hundred local doles in their
some&shy;what higher huddle of stone hovels were doing whatever
doles do: record&shy;ing, accounting, measuring, file-keeping,
waiting for instructions from their masters via the dragomen.</p>

<p>We stayed inside the ship while the hot winds roared, but the <em>Muse&rsquo;s</em>
cabiri scrambled out through maintenance hatches like so many
flesh-and-metal spiders, opened storage panels, rigged worklights,
strung long cables from the hull, pounded k-chrome stakes into solid
rock, unfolded steel-mesh canvas, and had the main performance tent up
and rigidified within thirty minutes. The first show was not scheduled
to begin for another six hours, but it took a while for the cabiri to
arrange the lighting and stage and set up the many rows of seats. The
old Globe Theater in London during the Bard&rsquo;s time, according
to troupe lore, would seat three thousand, but our little tent-theater
comfortably seated about eight hundred human beings. We expected far
fewer than that during each of our four scheduled perfor&shy;mances
on 25-25-261B.</p>

<p>On many worlds we have permission to land at a variety of
arbeiter huddles, but this world had only this single major human
population center. The town has no name, of course. We humans gave up
naming things long ago, abandoning that habit along with our culture,
politics, arts, history, hope, and sense of self. No one in the troupe
or among the arbeiters and doles here had a clue as to who had named
the Archon keep Mezel-Goull, which apparently meant
&ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s Rest,&rdquo; but the name seemed
appropriate. It <em>sounded</em> appropriate, even if the
words actually had no meaning.</p>

<p>The hulking mass of Archon steel and black stone dominated an
over&shy;hanging cliff about six miles north of this plateau upon
which the humans were housed. Through binoculars, I could see the tall
slits of tower windows glowing yellow while pale white searchlights
stabbed out from the keep and up to the highlands, then probed down
over the human escarpment and across the <em>Muse,</em>
then swept out to the sulfur sea. None of us from the troupe had ever
been to the keep, of course&mdash;why would humans, other than
dragomen (whom most of us do not consider human), have any
busi&shy;ness with Archons? They own us, they control our lives,
they dictate our actions and fates, but they have no interest in us and
we usually return the favor.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>There were twenty-three of us in this Shakespearean troupe
called the Earth&rsquo;s Men. Not all of us were men, of course,
although we knew through stage history that in the Bard&rsquo;s day
even the women&rsquo;s roles were acted by males.</p>

<p>My name is Wilbr. I was twenty SEY old that day we landed on
25- 25-261B and had been chosen for the troupe when I was nine and
turned out to be good enough at memorizing my lines and hitting my
marks to be on stage for most productions, but by age twenty I knew in
my heart that I would never be a great actor. Probably not even a good
one. But my hope remained to play Hamlet someday, somehow, somewhere.
Even if only once.</p>

<p>There were a couple of others about my age in the
Earth&rsquo;s Men; Philp was one of them and a good friend. There
were several young women in the troupe, including Agla&eacute;, the
best and most attractive Juliet and Rosalind I&rsquo;ve ever seen:
she was a year older than me and my choice for girlfriend, lover, and
wife, but she never noticed me; Tooley was our age, but he primarily
did basic maintenance engineering on the <em>Muse,</em>
although he could hold a spear in a crowd scene if pressed to.</p>

<p>Kemp and Burbank were the two real leaders of the troupe,
along with Kemp&rsquo;s wife (and Burbank&rsquo;s lover)
Condella, whom everyone secretly, and never affectionately, referred to
as &ldquo;the Cunt.&rdquo; I never learned how the
nick&shy;name got started&mdash;some say it was her French
accent as Catherine talking to her maid in <em>Henry V</em>&mdash;but
other and less kind guesses would probably have been equally accurate.</p>

<p>Kemp had always been a clown in the most honorable sense of
the word: a young arbeiter comic actor and improviser when he was
chosen for the Earth&rsquo;s Men by Burbank&rsquo;s father, the
former leader of the troupe, more than fifty years earlier. One of
Kemp&rsquo;s specialties was Falstaff although he&rsquo;d lost
weight as he aged, so he now had to wear a special suit fitted out with
padding whenever he played Sir John. He was a brilliant Falstaff, but
he was even more brilliant&mdash;frighteningly so&mdash;as
Lear. If Kemp had had his way, we would have performed <em>The
Tragedy of King Lear</em> for every second performance.</p>

<p>Burbank had the weight for Falstaff but not the comic timing,
and since he was in his early fifties SEY, was not quite old
enough&mdash;nor impressive enough in personality&mdash;to make
an adequate Lear. Yet he was now too old to play Hamlet, the role his
father had owned and in which this younger Burbank had also excelled.
There was something about the Prince&rsquo;s dither&shy;ing and
indecisiveness and self-pity that perfectly fit Burbank. Still, it was
a frustrating time for Burbank and he marked it by getting hammier and
hammier in the roles Kemp allowed him and by screwing Kemp&rsquo;s
much younger wife every chance he got.</p>

<p>Alleyn was our young Hamlet now and a wonderful one at that,
espe&shy;cially when set against Burbank&rsquo;s Claudius and
Kemp&rsquo;s Polonius. For villains we had Heminges. Kemp once said
to me after a few drinks that our real Heminges out-Iagoes Iago on and
off the stage. He also said that he wished that Heminges had Richard
III&rsquo;s hump and personality just so things would be more
peaceful aboard the <em>Muse.</em></p>

<p>Coeke was our Othello and was perfect in the role for more
reasons than his skin color. Recca, especially adept at playing Kate
the Shrew, was Heminges&rsquo;s wife and Coeke&rsquo;s
mistress&mdash;when she felt like it&mdash;and her easy
infidelity had done little in recent years to improve
Heminges&rsquo;s personality.</p>

<p>Heminges was also our only revolutionary.</p>

<p>I should explain that.</p>

<p>There were a few men or women out of the billions scattered
among the Archon and other alien stars who believed that humans should
revolt, throw off the yoke of the Archons and reestablish the
&ldquo;human era.&rdquo; As if that were possible. They were
all cranks and malcontents like Heminges.</p>

<p>I was about fifteen and we were in transit in the Pleroma when
I first heard Heminges mutter his suicidal sedition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could we possibly &lsquo;rise up&rsquo;
against the Archons?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Humans have no
weapons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Heminges had given me his Iago smile.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re <em>in</em> the most powerful
weapon left to our species, young Master Wilbr.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>Muse?&rdquo;</em> I said
stupidly. &ldquo;How could the <em>Muse</em> be a
weapon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Heminges had shaken his handsome head in something like
disgust. &ldquo;The touring ships are the last artifacts left from
the human age of greatness,&rdquo; he hissed at me.
&ldquo;Think of it, Wilbr&hellip;three fusion reactors, a
fusion engine that used to move our ancestors around the
Earth&rsquo;s solar system in <em>days</em> and which
the Archon cabiri bots&hellip; and Tooley&hellip; keep tuned
for us. Why, the flame tail from this ship is three miles long during
early atmosphere entry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words had made me cold all through. &ldquo;Use the <em>Muse</em>
as a weapon?&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo; I had no words for
it. &ldquo;The Archons would catch us and put us in a pain
synthesizer for the rest of our lives.&rdquo; I assumed this last
statement would put an end to the discussion.</p>

<p>Kemp had told me about the Archons&rsquo; pain
synthesizers the first months I&rsquo;d been with the troupe. The
lowest of the four tiers of alien races rarely deigned to deal with us,
but when dole or arbeiter disappointed them or disobeyed them in any
way, the Archons dropped the hapless people into a pain synthesizer and
kept them alive for extra decades. The settings on the synthesizers
were reputed to include such pleasures as &ldquo;crushed
testicle&rdquo; or &ldquo;hot poker up the anus&rdquo; or
&ldquo;blade through eyeball&rdquo;&hellip; and the pain
never ended. Drugs in the synthesizer soup kept the prisoner awake and
suffer&shy;ing for long decades. And, Kemp had whispered to me, the
first thing the Archons do to someone going into the pain synthesizer
is to remove their tongue and vocal cords so they cannot scream.</p>

<p>Heminges laughed. &ldquo;To punish us, the Archon would
have to be alive. And so would we. Three fusion reactors make for a
very nice bomb, young Master Wilbr.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That thought had kept me awake for weeks, but when I asked
Tooley, who was apprenticing with Yerick who was then the
ship&rsquo;s engineer, if such a thing were possible, he told me
that it wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;really&mdash;that the
reac&shy;tors could melt and that would be messy, but that they
couldn&rsquo;t be turned into what he called &ldquo;a fusion
bomb.&rdquo; Not really. Besides, Tooley said in his friendly lisp,
the Archons had long since retrofitted <em>Muse</em> with
so many of their own posttech safeguards and monitors that no amount of
mere human tinkering could cause the reactors to go critical.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would we do if
we&hellip;did&hellip;somehow attack the Archons?&rdquo; I
asked Heminges when I was fifteen. &ldquo;Where would we go? Humans
can&rsquo;t transit the Pleroma&hellip;only Abraxas can do
that, praise be unto His name, and He shares those sacred secrets only
with the <em>Demiurgos,</em> Poimen, and Archons.
We&rsquo;d be stranded forever in whatever star system
we&rsquo;d started the revolt in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Heminges had only snorted at that and turned his attention
back to his ale.</p>

<p>Still&hellip; all these years later&hellip;just the
thought of losing the <em>Muse</em> made me shiver. She
was home to me. She was the only home I&rsquo;d known in the past
eleven SEY and I fully expected to call her home for another fifty SEY
until it was time for me to be carted back to Earth on a funeral barge.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>We were performing <em>Much Ado About Nothing</em>
and because I was playing Balthasar, Don Pedro&rsquo;s attendant, I
didn&rsquo;t have to go with the supernumer&shy;aries as they
went out to drum up business with the Circus Parade.</p>

<p>There were twenty cabiri for every human from our troupe, but
the parade is hard to ignore. Those not preparing for major roles in <em>Much
Ado</em> and our huge metal spiders made their way to the dole
city on the higher ridges before the cabiri activated their holograms
and my friends already in costume began blowing their horns and
shouting and singing into their loudhailers.</p>

<p>Only a few doles joined the procession then&mdash;they
rarely turn out for the Circus Parade&mdash;but by the time the
line of brightly costumed actors and the procession of free-roaming
elephants with red streamers, tigers, dromedaries carrying monkeys
wearing fezzes, wolves in purple robes, and even some leaping dolphins
got halfway through the arbeiter city, there were several hundred
people following them back to the <em>Muse.</em></p>

<p>More trumpets and announcements began blaring from the ship
herself. The lower hull is always part of the stage and backdrop, of
course, and this night the <em>Muse</em> extruded her
lower balconies and catwalks and rows of spots and other lights beneath
the tent just minutes before the crowd arrived. Holograms and smart
paint became the fields and forests and hilltop manse of Leonato while
we players in the wings hurried with our last costume and makeup
preparations.</p>

<p>We started on time to a final flourish of silencing trumpets.
Peering out from behind the arras like Polonius, I could see that there
were about six hundred paying customers in their seats. (The chinks
were only good in pubs and the few provision outlets, of course, but
they were good on all the worlds we visited. Chinks are chinks.)</p>

<p>In the old days, <em>Much Ado</em> would have
been Kemp&rsquo;s and Condella&rsquo;s tour de force, but a
middle-aged Benedick and Beatrice simply didn&rsquo;t work, so
after watching Burbank and Recca being merely adequate&mdash;and
both very bitchy&mdash;in the roles for years, on this tour Alleyn
and Agla&eacute; were playing the leads.</p>

<p>They were amazing. Alleyn brought to Benedick all the bravado
and uncertainty of the sexually experienced young nobleman who remained
terrified of love and marriage. But it was Agla&eacute; who
dominated the perfor&shy;mances&mdash;just as the real Beatrice
dominated Leonato&rsquo;s compound above Messina with her
incomparable and almost frightening wit leavened by a certain hint of a
disappointed lover&rsquo;s melancholy. Someone once said that of
all of Shakespeare&rsquo;s characters, it was Beatrice and Benedick
that one would most want to be seated next to at a dinner party, and I
confess that it was a pleasure being onstage with these two consummate
young actors in those roles.</p>

<p>Kemp had to satisfy himself with a scene-stealing turn as
Dogberry, Bur&shy;bank blustered as Leonato, and Heminges had to
throttle down his ultimate Iago evil to fit into the lesser villain of
Don John, a character that Kemp once suggested to me was indeed
Shakespeare&rsquo;s early, rough sketch for Iago.</p>

<p>Anne played the hapless Hero and Condella was reduced to
overacting as Margaret, Hero&rsquo;s waiting gentlewoman attendant.
(Condella always created precisely the character here in <em>Much
Ado</em> that she used for the Nurse in <em>Romeo and
Juliet,</em> even though I&rsquo;m certain that the Bard
hadn&rsquo;t meant for the two to have any similarities.) And I got
to woo her onstage even though I&rsquo;m twenty SEY younger than
she is.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>The audience, mostly arbeiters in their brown rawool and a few
score doles in their cotton gray, laughed hard and applauded and
cheered frequently.</p>

<p>Alleyn and Agla&eacute; were wonderful in their act 1
banter and we&rsquo;d just gotten into act 2 with Benedick asking
me to sing a &ldquo;divine air&rdquo;&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t believe I mentioned that they had me play Balthasar
primarily because I was the best singer in the troupe now that Davin
had died and left us&mdash;and I&rsquo;d just begun the song
when everything changed forever.</p>

<p><em>Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,</em></p>

<p><em>Men were deceivers ever,</em></p>

<p><em>One foot in sea, and one on shore,</em></p>

<p><em>To one thing constant never.</em></p>

<p><em>Then sigh not so, but let them go,</em></p>

<p><em>And be you blithe and bonny,</em></p>

<p><em>Converting all your sounds of woe</em></p>

<p><em>Into Hey, nonny nonny.</em></p>

<p>In the middle of my song, into the tent floated a
forty-foot-long heavy iron-gray gravity sledge carrying at least eight
carapace-hooded, chitinous, four-armed, ten-foot-tall Archons, each
sitting deep in its own iron-gray metal throne. Hanging from the sledge
by their synaptic fiberneural fila&shy;ments, which ran down to
their hairless, distended skulls like slim, translu&shy;cent copper
hair, were four naked dragomen. Their oversized, lidless eyes focused
on the stage and their cartilage-free ears rotating the better to pick
up&mdash;and relay to their Archon masters&mdash;my singing.</p>

<p>Arbeiters and doles created a racket scrambling out of their
seats to get out from under the massive, flat-bottomed gravity sledge.
Archons landed their vehicles when and where they pleased and more than
a few humans from 25-25-261B certainly had been crushed before this
night.</p>

<p>But the sledge did not land. It rose to a point just below the
tent roof about forty feet from the stage and hovered there. The doles
and arbeit&shy;ers who&rsquo;d fled found places to sit in the
aisles out from under the sledge&rsquo;s shadow and the dangling
bare feet of the dragomen and returned their at&shy;tention to the
stage, their faces pale but attentive.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a professional. I did not miss a beat or drop a
note. But I know my voice quavered as I sang the next stanza.</p>

<p><em>Sing no more ditties, sing no more,</em></p>

<p><em>Of dumps so dull and heavy.</em></p>

<p><em>The fraud of men was ever so,</em></p>

<p><em>Since summer first was leavy.</em></p>

<p><em>Then sigh not so, but let them go,</em></p>

<p><em>And be you blithe and bonny,</em></p>

<p><em>Converting all your sounds of woe</em></p>

<p><em>Into Hey, nonny nonny.</em></p>

<p>Gough, playing Don Pedro, did not miss a beat.
&ldquo;&lsquo;By my troth, a good song,&rsquo;&rdquo;
he cried, his eyes never shifting to the sledge and Archons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And an ill singer, my
lord,&rsquo;&rdquo; was my response. For once I was telling the
truth. My voice had cracked or quavered half a dozen times in those
eight simple lines of singing.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ha, no, no, faith,&rsquo;&rdquo;
bellowed Gough/Don Pedro, &ldquo;&lsquo;thou sing&rsquo;st
well enough for a shift.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>My hands were shaking and I <em>did</em> sneak a
glance at the motionless sledge and the slowly twisting dragomen
hanging naked and slick-skinned and hairless and sexless beneath that
sledge, the filaments from the four of their skulls running up to red
sensory node bundles on the complicated chest carapaces of the eight
Archons.</p>

<p>Did the peasant arbeiters and equally peasant doles out
there&mdash;any of them&mdash;have any idea that
Gough&rsquo;s use of the ancient word &ldquo;shift&rdquo;
in his line meant something like &ldquo;to make do&rdquo;?
Almost certainly not. Almost all of the beauty and subtlety of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s language was lost on them. (It had taken me
years after the troupe adopted me to begin appreciating it.)</p>

<p>Then what in the hell were the Archons perceiving as they
heard these archaic words through the dangling dragomen&rsquo;s
ears, saw our colorful cos&shy;tumes and overbright makeup through
the dragomen&rsquo;s eyes?</p>

<p>Alleyn caught my eye, forcing my attention back to the play,
responded broadly to Don Pedro, and turned to the
audience&mdash;ignoring the gravity sledge&mdash;and gave his
chuckling Benedick&rsquo;s reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;An he had been a dog that should have
howled thus, they would have hanged him. And I pray God his bad voice
bode no mischief. I had as life have heard the night-raven, come what
plague could have come after it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The night-raven, I knew and the arbeiters and doles almost
certainly did not know&mdash;who in the name of the Gnostic God of
All Opposites had any idea what the dragomen and Archons
knew?&mdash;was the bird of ill omen.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>There is always a party after a performance. There was that
night.</p>

<p>Some worlds are so dolefully awful that we have to hold the
party on the <em>Muse,</em> inviting the pretty girls and
pretty boys aboard (there are no human dignitaries, mayors,
burgomasters, commissars, or officials of importance in human life now,
only the gray doles, and they don&rsquo;t know how to party). On
the more palatable worlds, and 25-25-261B qualified as such, we tried
to move the party to a local pub or barn or similar public space. This
rock had a pub in the oldest section of arbeiter town. (Those are the
only two public institutions that have survived the end of all human
politics and culture after our species&rsquo; hopeless
enslavement&mdash;pubs and churches. We&rsquo;d never partied
in a church. At least not yet.)</p>

<p>The drinking with the few adventurous arbeiters and
storytelling and drinking and gambling and more storytelling and more
drinking went on until the sulfur winds began to howl against the
titanium shutters, and then the young ones among us began pairing off
with the most attractive locals we could cull from the herd.</p>

<p>Agla&eacute; rarely stayed at these parties for long and
never went off with locals, but Philp, Pig (our apprentice Pyk),
red-haired Kyder, Coeke, Alleyn, Anne, Pope, Lana, the short Hywo,
Gough. Tooley, and some of the rest of us each found someone eager to
make the beast with two backs with a rare stranger to their world, and
two by two, arbeiter and actor, like randy animals filing toward
Noah&rsquo;s Ark, we began slipping away from the ebbing party and
heading for arbeiters&rsquo; hovels and barracks and outbuildings
and barns.</p>

<p>In my case it was a barn.</p>

<p>We did it three times in the loft that night as the acid rains
blew against the stone walls. (It would have been more times, but at
age twenty, I&rsquo;m not as young and resilient as I once was.)
The barn held five animals (besides us)&mdash;a llama, a cow, a
goat, and two chickens. None seemed bothered by our exertions or
Larli&rsquo;s loud cries.</p>

<p>Larli was the arbeiter girl who&rsquo;d invited me home to
her barrack&rsquo;s barn. She was fairly typical for a
postperformance fling girl: very young but old enough for me not to
feel too guilty, curly hair, pretty eyes, broad shoulders, more muscles
than I&rsquo;d ever have, and hands so callused and strong that
sev&shy;eral times when I cried out, it was in pain not ecstasy.</p>

<p>She liked to talk and ask questions&mdash;also fairly
typical for a postplay fling date&mdash;and I tried to stay awake
and keep up my end of the conversation (since I was too tired to keep
anything else up) as the wind and sulfur rain tore at the slate tiles
above us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must see a lot of wonderful places,&rdquo;
she said, lying back on the blanket on the straw. &ldquo;Lots of
wonderful worlds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh-huh,&rdquo; I said. I was deciding how to
explain that I was going to return to the <em>Muse</em> to
sleep. I always came home to the <em>Muse</em> to sleep
after the postperformance. This night was already later than most.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you ever gone to Earth?&rdquo; she asked.
Her voice almost broke on the soft syllable of the last word. They
always do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was born on Earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could tell by her silent stare that she didn&rsquo;t
believe me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lot of players come from Earth,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;I was nine when they chose me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one&hellip; <em>alive</em>&hellip;
on Earth,&rdquo; she whispered. I could hear the acid rain outside
diminish and the hot winds begin to blow. It would not be long before
the terminator crossed this plateau. And it was the Sabbath.</p>

<p>I patted her pale but powerfully muscled leg. &ldquo;There
are thousands of living arbeiters on Earth&hellip; um&hellip;
Larli.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought only the dead lived there.&rdquo; She
shook her blond curls, flus&shy;tered. &ldquo;You know what I
mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I nodded in the dim glow of one shielded lantern hanging on a
post below this loft. &ldquo;There are a few thousand living humans
on Earth,&rdquo; I said quietly. &ldquo;My family among them. I
was born there. The cabiri tend the tombs and do the heavy work, but
there is always some labor for the doles and arbeiters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it like, Wilbr? Earth, I mean? It must be
very beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It rains a lot,&rdquo; I said. This was an
understatement. Earth had not seen a blue sky in more than a thousand
years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the oceans&hellip; the <em>perfecti</em>
tell tales of the great blue seas. Oceans of <em>water. They</em>
must be gorgeous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, thinking only of how I was
going to disengage myself so I could get back to my bunk on the <em>Muse.</em>
The oceans of Earth had been drained by the <em>Demiurgos</em>
long ago. Everything there now was rock and tombs: metal sarcophagi,
tens and hundreds of billions of them, stacked on rocky plains, coastal
shelves, deep shadowed mountain ranges that had once been ocean depths.
Earth had no ecology, no wild things, no domesticated plants or
animals&mdash;not even the ubiquitous goats and cows and llamas and
chickens and other pathetic livestock scattered among sad arbeiter
communities like this around the Tell&mdash;and no real towns. The
few thousand arbeiters and doles were scattered among the tombs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the sky, so blue,&rdquo; whispered the
girl, whose name I&rsquo;d forgotten again. &ldquo;It must be <em>so</em>
lovely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said and stifled a yawn. My
earliest memories were the red sky-scars of descending and ascending
Archon funeral barges, carrying millions more of freeze-dried human
corpses to their resting places and then ascend&shy;ing again with
the empty sarcophagi, the massive, ugly ship flames clawing across the
gray-clouded sky to the backdrop thunder of their booming pulse drives.
The only clear areas on Earth were the spaceports where the funeral
barges landed and took off, around the clock, while huge service cabiri
unloaded the transport sarcophagi, tumbled the brittle corpses into
bins, and then reloaded the containers.</p>

<p>The girl started caressing me again. I gently disengaged her
hand and began pulling on my clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow&rsquo;s&hellip;
today&rsquo;s&hellip; Sabbath,&rdquo; I whispered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you in church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>I actually <em>was</em> religious&mdash;I was
raised that way&mdash;and I did see Larli in church later that
morning, but only across the crowded heads of the congregation. I was
sure that more doles and arbeiters than usual attended services that
day just to see the outworlders. As always, the rough stone pews were
filled with the usual bands of brown wool homespun work uniforms,
slightly less rough gray cotton administrator tunics, and the small
cluster of colorful silks and cottons and wools that we dozen or so
regularly churchgoing Earth&rsquo;s Men chose to wear to Mass.</p>

<p>The church itself was no cathedral. The locals had cleaned out
one of the stone barns erected by the Archon mechs, put rough glass in
the windows, converted the hayloft to a choir loft&mdash;my loins
stirred when I saw the loft and that&rsquo;s when I searched the
crowd for Larli&mdash;and put some crude stone and canvas images of
Gnostic saints and Abraxas him/herself at sta&shy;tions along the
wall and behind the altar rail. The icons and paintings were rough but
I could make out Saint Valentinius. Saint Sophia, Saint Thomas, Saint
Emerson, Saint Blake, Saint Hesse, Saint Caprocates with his wife
Al&shy;exandra hovering behind and above him, Saint Menander, Saint
Basilides, and Simon Magus. That last prophet of the church was always
depicted as flying, and in the painting along the north wall, the
painted expression of Simon Magus looked as surprised at his sudden
flying ability as the poorly rendered faces of the peasants below him.</p>

<p>Abraxas, of course, held center stage, roughly where a huge
cross and Jesus might have hung behind the altar long ago during the
brief Christian era. The large sculpture carried the traditional whip
and shield&mdash;showing the conjoined opposites of attack and
defense&mdash;and had the usual head of a rooster, body of a man,
and legs of heavy, coiled snakes. Behind the sculpture on a black,
circular stone backdrop were gold stars with varying number of rays as
well as the eight-fold symbol of the <em>ogdoad,</em>
representing the tran&shy;scending of the seven planets.</p>

<p>The two <em>perfecti</em> at the front of the
church&mdash;one male, one female, as pre&shy;scribed by the
Abraxic requirement of joining of opposites, one in all white with a
black collar band, the other wearing the reverse&mdash;performed
the open&shy;ing rituals with the usual provincial blend of
ineptitude and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The male <em>perfectus</em> gave the sermon. It
was the third sermon from Saint Jung&rsquo;s <em>Seven
Sermons to the Dead</em> and I could have recited it from memory,
and with far more feeling than the white-robed <em>perfectus</em>
could deliver on his best day. Compared to memorizing and delivering
the simplest line from Shakespeare, Jung&rsquo;s rhetoric was
baby&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p><em>The dead approaches like mist out of the swamps and
they shouted: &ldquo;Speak to us further about the highest
god!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>&mdash;<em>Abraxas is the god whom it is difficult
to know. His power is the very greatest because man does not perceive
it at all. Man sees the</em> summum bonum, <em>supreme
good, of the sun, and also the</em> infmum malum, <em>endless
evil, of the devil, but Abraxas, he does not see, for he is undefinable
life itself, which is the mother of good and evil alike.</em></p>

<p><em>Life appears smaller and weaker than the</em>
summum bonum, <em>wherefore it is hard to think that Abraxas
should supersede in his power the sun, which is the radiant fountain of
all life forces.</em></p>

<p><em>Abraxas is the sun and also the eternally gaping
abyss of emptiness, of the diminisher and dissembler, the devil.</em></p>

<p><em>The power of Abraxas is twofold. You cannot see it,
because in your eyes the opposition of this power seems to cancel it
out.</em></p>

<p><em>That which is spoken by God-the-Sun is life.</em></p>

<p><em>That which is spoken by the Devil is death.</em></p>

<p><em>Abraxas, however, speaks the venerable and also
accursed word, which is life and death at once.</em></p>

<p><em>Abraxas generates truth and falsehood, good and
evil, light and darkness with the same word and in the same deed.
Therefore Abraxas is truly the terrible one.</em></p>

<p><em>He is magnificent even as the lion at the very
moment when he strikes his prey down. His beauty is like the beauty of
a spring morn.</em></p>

<p><em>Indeed, he is himself the greater Pan, and also the
lesser. He is Priapos.</em></p>

<p><em>He is the monster of the underworld, the octopus
with a thousand tentacles, he is the twistings of winged serpents and
of madness.</em></p>

<p><em>He is the hermaphrodite of the lowest beginning.</em></p>

<p><em>He is the lord of toads and frogs, who live in water
and come out unto the land, and who sing together at high noon and at
midnight.</em></p>

<p><em>He is fullness, uniting itself with emptiness.</em></p>

<p><em>He is the sacred wedding;</em></p>

<p><em>He is love and the murder of love;</em></p>

<p><em>He is the holy one and his betrayer.</em></p>

<p><em>He is the brightest light of day and the deepest
night of madness.</em></p>

<p><em>To see him means blindness;</em></p>

<p><em>To know him is sickness;</em></p>

<p><em>To worship him is death;</em></p>

<p><em>To fear him is wisdom;</em></p>

<p><em>Not to resist him means liberation.</em></p>

<p><em>God lives behind the</em>&mdash;</p>

<p>The <em>perfectus</em> suddenly fell silent. The
priest&rsquo;s gaze was riveted on the rear door of the church and
one by one the congregation swiveled their necks to see what or who had
interrupted the service.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d never seen a dragoman alone and I&rsquo;d
never seen one close up like this. Both new experiences were unsettling.</p>

<p>He&mdash;I use the pronoun loosely since dragomen had no
sex&mdash;was about my height but he had much larger eyes, much
larger ears, no lips to speak of, no teeth visible, no real chin, a
long tapered nose, and a queerly shaped head, his forehead sloped back
along a cranium that seemed to have been malformed rearward until it
blended with the long synaptic filaments that trailed on the floor
behind now with a faint metallic rustling. His fingers were far too
long, as if they had at least one extra joint and perhaps more, and
disturbingly spatulate. His feet were flat and too broad&mdash;he
had no toes and I could hear puckery suckerish sounds as he strode
across the broad paving stones of the barn-church. His legs were too
long, jointed oddly, and gave the false impression of being almost
boneless. He was hairless and naked, of course, and as he passed my pew
I saw how his skin glistened wetly, coarsely, like molded wax. He had
no nipples. I could see how a waxy fold of loose skin folded down from
his lower abdomen to cover whatever orifices he had for urination and
excretion; it is common knowledge that dragomen have no real genitals
and thus are more <em>neuter</em> than hermaphroditic.</p>

<p>He stopped at Kemp&rsquo;s pew and, bending oddly from the
waist, leaned toward the leader of our troupe. The dragoman&rsquo;s
voice was as high and flat as a young child&rsquo;s without any of
a child&rsquo;s charm. &ldquo;The Heresiarch bids you to
perform tonight at the Archon keep. Have your people dressed and
pre&shy;pared for transport at the moment the winds drop on the
hour of the third mine shift.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He may have said something else, but if so the words were lost
in the explosion of surprised murmuring and shifting in the church.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is our chance,&rdquo; whispered Heminges
as the men crowded into one of the <em>Muse&rsquo;s</em>
two makeup and costuming rooms that afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chance?&rdquo; said Gough. Kemp and Condella
had decided that we were doing the Scottish Play, over
Burbank&rsquo;s protests and Alleyn&rsquo;s and
Agla&eacute;&rsquo;s indifference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To strike,&rdquo; said Heminges. He was
costuming himself for the role of Duncan.</p>

<p>Gough rolled his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; I asked. I
was already terrified at the thought of performing before the Archons;
I didn&rsquo;t need Heminges&rsquo;s revo&shy;lution
fantasies and conspiracies that night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard of a troupe being
invited to perform before Archons before&hellip; <em>in
their keep,&rdquo;</em> whispered Heminges.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never heard of it before, because
it&rsquo;s never happened before,&rdquo; said Old Adam. He was
to be Banquo tonight. His favorite role was as Hamlet&rsquo;s
father&rsquo;s ghost. Adam had been to more Bard Rendezvous on
Stratford and performed in more competitions there than any of us, even
Kemp and Bur&shy;bank. He knew more lore than anyone else in the
Earth&rsquo;s Men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it <em>is</em>
perfect,&rdquo; hissed Heminges as he applied his bald wig.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfect for <em>what,</em> for
Christ&rsquo;s sake? We can&rsquo;t <em>do</em>
anything up there&hellip; but put on the show, I mean. If we
did&hellip; if we did&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pain synthesizers,&rdquo; rumbled Coeke.
&ldquo;For the rest of our lives and then some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Heminges showed his thin, tight Iago smile. &ldquo;When we
take the <em>Muse</em> to the keep, we set thrust to full
burn, then take off before&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, shut the fuck up, Heminges,&rdquo; said
Burbank, who&rsquo;d come closer without us noticing.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not taking the ship up there. The dragoman
told Kemp that we were to be fully dressed and have all our props ready
by&hellip; less than an hour from now&hellip; and a gravity
sledge is going to take us the six miles to the castle. Do you <em>really</em>
think the Archons would let us get a weapon&hellip; or anything
that could be used as a weapon&hellip; anywhere near the
keep?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Heminges said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear another word of your
silly revolution fantasies,&rdquo; snapped Burbank, his voice as
mad-strong as Hamlet&rsquo;s speaking to Gertrude. &ldquo;If
you play this particular brand of sick make-believe again&mdash;one
more word&mdash;I swear by Abraxas that we&rsquo;ll leave you
behind on this godforsaken rock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>It looked as if two thirds of the arbeiters and doles not at
work in the mines showed up to watch us leave on the gravity sledge. It
was easy to understand why they were curious. In all the centuries they
and their ancestors had been on this rock, the only thing that left
from the human city to be taken to the keep were dead bodies to be
hauled to the Archon spaceport to await transshipment to Earth.</p>

<p>There was a funeral barge up there now. We&rsquo;d
followed it through the Pleroma to this world and had planned to follow
it out in three days to the next planet on our tour.</p>

<p>From the look on the silent arbeiters&rsquo; faces as we
floated past the city and up the road carved into rock toward the
highlands, they didn&rsquo;t expect us to return from the keep
alive. Perhaps we didn&rsquo;t either. But the excitement was real.
It had been the unanimous opinion of Kemp, Condella, Burbank, Pope, Old
Adam, and the other senior members of the troupe that no traveling
Shakespearean group had ever been invited to perform before the Archon
before. We had no idea what to expect.</p>

<p>The dragoman who&rsquo;d come to the church&mdash;if
it was the same one, they all looked alike to me&mdash;was in the
control cab of the sledge with various Archon cabiri and we were on the
open freight pallet behind, where the human coffins were usually
carried, so there was no chance for further con&shy;versation with
the dragoman. The cabiri that the Archons had designed for the <em>Muse</em>
and other old human spacecraft I&rsquo;d
seen&mdash;Shakespearean troupe, <em>perfecti,</em>
and physiocrat&mdash;were more huge metal-spider than organic, but
I noticed more patches of flesh and real hands and even a mouth, more
lipped and human-looking than the dragoman&rsquo;s, on the cabiri
in the sledge cab. The flesh, lips, teeth, fingers, and the rest looked
as if they had come from a human-being parts bin. This was disturbing.</p>

<p>It was also disturbing to be in full costume and makeup so
long <em>before</em> the performance. We carried along any
changes in costume we&rsquo;d need and a few
props&mdash;chairs, a table, daggers, and the like&mdash;but no
backdrops or scenery.</p>

<p>And we assumed we&rsquo;d have none of the
computer-controlled lighting or microphone pickups that were always
part of our performances at the <em>Muse</em> tents.</p>

<p>The sledge slid two meters above the rock road as it rose
toward the keep of Mezel-Goull.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d never seen the spaceport or a funeral barge
from up close before and we all stared as the sledge reached the cliff
ledge and silently floated past the perfectly flat landing area. The
barge was as grim as its purpose and huge, a three-siloed gray-black
smooth-hulled mass that floated five meters above the scorch-blackened
rock. Ramps led down to temperature-controlled storage sheds. More of
the disturbing flesh-and-metal cabiri were loading human-sized
sarcophagi up dark ramps. The interior of the barge glowed dim red. The
ship was large enough to carry tens and tens of thou&shy;sands of
sarcophagi.</p>

<p>There were three other Archon ships at the keep&rsquo;s
spaceport. We&rsquo;d seen such ships before, passing them during
our transit from Kenoma to Pleroma or the reverse, but those were
always video images, fast glimpses, and fuzzy, distant holos. The
close-up reality of the three gray, grim, massive, heavily gunned and
blistered and turreted, shaped and shielded vessels reminded all of us
that the Archons were a fierce breed. After all these centuries we had
no idea who or what their enemies were in the dark light-years beyond
the Tell&mdash;we knew only that they were subservient to the
Poimen, <em>Demiurgos,</em> and mythical
Abraxi&mdash;but these ships were built to fight. They were, all of
us were thinking in silence, destroyers of worlds.</p>

<p>The keep loomed larger than we had imagined. From the <em>Muse,</em>
during our previous visits to the arbeiter town below, we&rsquo;d
guessed the height of the Archon castle to be about a thousand feet,
its width about two-thirds that as its shape conformed to the narrow
precipice a mile here above the black sulfur sea, but as we approached
we realized that it must be more than two hundred stories tall. The
gray-black stone was not stone but metal. Everywhere along its walls
were blisters and bulges, much like on their war&shy;ships, but
here long rivulets and streaks of rust ran down. The streaks were the
color of dried blood.</p>

<p>Some of the window slits far above glowed a dull orange.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need to take a piss,&rdquo; said our
apprentice Pig. He started to climb down from the slowly moving sledge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay on,&rdquo; snapped Kemp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo; began Pig.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need to go as well,&rdquo; said Kyder,
costumed well as one of the three weird sisters in the first scene.
&ldquo;I doubt if they&rsquo;ll have lavatories in this Archon
heap.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Stay on the goddamned sledge,&rdquo;</em>
shouted Kemp. &ldquo;If you get left behind, we won&rsquo;t be
able to put on the show.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As if the dragoman or cabiri in the cab had heard him, the
sledge began spinning and climbing higher then, swirling in the air to
fifty feet of altitude, then a hundred, then three hundred. Everyone
grabbed everyone, backed away from the open edge of the freight bed,
and dropped to at least one knee.</p>

<p>The sledge swung out over the edge of the cliff. Acid breakers
crashed onto fang-sharp boulders five thousand feet below us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, fuck me!&rdquo; cried the Pig. I could see
the wet stain spreading down his brown tights and I also felt the
sudden urge to urinate.</p>

<p>Six hundred feet up on the wall of stained metal-rock, high on
the west&shy;ern side of the keep that hung out over the
cliff&rsquo;s edge a mile above the sea, there came a great
grinding and a trapezoid of light fifty or sixty feet high began to
shape itself.</p>

<p>The sledge floated forward and we entered the keep.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>The Scottish Play was difficult to do well under the best of
conditions, and I would not say that the Archon keep of Mezel-Goull
provided the best of conditions.</p>

<p>Our stage was a circular shelf about sixty feet across at the
bottom of a giant well at the center of the keep. Or perhaps
&ldquo;well&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t the proper word here, even
though the lightning-roiled sky was visible through the round opening
far above, since the rock-steel cliffs on all sides of our circle
opened wider the higher they went. I estimated the walls here to be
about three hundred feet high. All along the rough circle of stone were
small cave openings, and outside these openings, on irregular slabs and
ledges, sat the Archons&mdash;certainly more than a thousand of
them. Perhaps two or three thousand.</p>

<p>Hanging by their filament hair around this almost gladiatorial
space were dragomen&mdash;I guessed fifty, but there could have
been more&mdash;attached to the crouching Archons&rsquo;
sensory nerve bundles only by their filaments. Each
dragoman&rsquo;s synaptic fibers connected to at least twenty or
thirty Archons, who looked more insectoid than ever here in their
native habitat, crouched and multilegged on their rock shelves, some
holding their red nerve bundle packets away from their bodies with a
pair of hands, looking much like an ancient holo I once saw on Earth of
a bearded Jesus Christ (or perhaps it was Mohammed; one of the ancient
gods at least) holding forth his red heart as if only recently ripped
from his
chest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only bright light was on our solid circle of yellow stone
or metal. All the rest of the rising cavernous space was lighted by the
dimmest of red glows from the cavern openings. Lightning continued to
ripple and tear above us, but something muffled all sound from beyond
the
keep.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our performance was perhaps the best we&rsquo;d ever given.</p>

<p>Kemp and Condella played the Thane and his Queen, of course,
with Burbank outdoing himself as the drunken Porter. Watching Condella
as Lady Ma&hellip; as the Queen&hellip; reminded me of why she
was one of the most incredible touring actresses in the Tell.</p>

<p>For years I had played Macduff&rsquo;s son but more
recently had been up&shy;graded to Lennox, one of the Scottish
thanes, so I got to be onstage between the three witches&rsquo;
scenes during the second scene where King Duncan, Malcolm, and the rest
of us spy &ldquo;the bloody man,&rdquo; and I confess that my
first line&mdash;&ldquo;What a haste looks through his eyes! So
should he look that seems to speak things
strange&rdquo;&mdash;came out as more powerful squeak than bold
pronouncement.</p>

<p>This unique setting for our performance did not seem to
distract the others. Kemp was extraordinary. Condella transcended
herself, although&mdash;as she once told me
bitterly&mdash;&rdquo;The Queen in this damned Scottish Play is
just <em>too</em> good a role, Master Wilbr. Every time
she&rsquo;s onstage everyone else, even the Thane, is thrown into
shadow. Shakespeare had to keep her offstage, the same as he had to
kill Mercutio early in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> or let
him take over the play, like a callower Hamlet wandering
loose.&rdquo; And it was true, I noticed back then, that Lady
Ma&hellip; the Queen&hellip; exits in act 3, scene 4, and
isn&rsquo;t seen again until she returns, already lost to madness,
at the start of act 5.</p>

<p>Agla&eacute;, the most beautiful young actress on this
world or any other world, the most beautiful actress in the Tell or
beyond, played one of the three Weird Sisters and her makeup was
almost, not quite, good enough to hide her beauty behind warts,
wrinkles, a fake nose, and a wispy beard.</p>

<p>As I exited&hellip;which meant just to walk outside the
circle of light onto the dark part of the round slab of
floor&hellip;Agla&eacute; came on and cried,
&ldquo;&lsquo;Where hast thou been,
sister?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne, as the second witch, answered,
&ldquo;&lsquo;Killing swine.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Standing in the offstage darkness, I peered up at the ungainly
slabs and ledges and cavemouths. Did these alien things know what
witches were? What swine were? Presumably the latter since they had
chosen pigs as one of the few forms of livestock to bring along with
their human slaves.</p>

<p>The third witch cried as if blind,
&ldquo;&lsquo;Sister, where thou?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Agla&eacute; responded, voice husky and ancient,
&ldquo;&lsquo;A sailor&rsquo;s wife had chestnuts in her
lap. And munched and munched and munched. &ldquo;Give
me,&rdquo; quoth I. &ldquo;Aroint thee, witch,&rdquo; the
rump-fed runnion cries. Her husband&rsquo;s to Aleppo gone, master
o&rsquo;th&rsquo; <em>Tiger.</em> But in a sieve
I&rsquo;ll thither sail, and, like a rat without a tail,
I&rsquo;ll do, I&rsquo;ll do, and I&rsquo;ll
do.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Dear Abraxas above,</em> I thought, my heart
pounding wildly, <em>these Archons will not understand a word or
thought of this. What help can the soulless dragomen be? They see and
hear and maybe translate the words, but how can you translate
Shakespeare to alien minds?</em></p>

<p>And hard on the heels of that thought came a more terrible
certainty: <em>this is some sort of trial; the Archons are
deciding whether to let us live or not.</em></p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>We played on. Sans props, sans scenery, sans curtain, sans
human audience.</p>

<p>When one act ended, we would all pause outside the circle of
light for a few seconds and then begin the next. Kemp later told me
that this was more or less the way Shakespeare and his people had done
it in their day; that acts and scenes, as separate entities, were a
later invention.</p>

<p>One of Kemp&rsquo;s earliest lines, to the witches, was
&ldquo;The Thane of Cawdor lives. Why do you dress me in borrowed
clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dear God, I loved such phrases. &ldquo;The Thane of
Cawdor.&rdquo; It evoked human ages and vital human barbarity long
lost to all of us. But what could it possibly mean to the hooded,
earless, handless, eyeless, faceless Archons on their bug ledges above?</p>

<p>By the time Kemp choked out these anguished lines, I was sure
that we&rsquo;d already signed our own death warrants through our
very incomprehensibil&shy;ity to this chitinous audience:</p>

<p><em>If it were done when &lsquo;tis done, then
&lsquo;twere well</em></p>

<p><em>It were done quickly. If th&rsquo; assassination</em></p>

<p><em>Could trammel up the consequence and catch</em></p>

<p><em>With his surcease success, that but this blow</em></p>

<p><em>Might be the be-all and the end-all here,</em></p>

<p><em>But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,</em></p>

<p><em>We&rsquo;d jump the life to come&hellip;</em></p>

<p>When suddenly, from the dark ledges above there came a
susurration as of many insect breaths blowing over violin-bow
forelimbs, followed by a growing <em>chrr&hellip;
chrrr&hellip; chrrrr&hellip; chrrrrr.</em></p>

<p>Kemp as the Thane did not miss a beat, but offstage in the
dark I leaned on Tooley, one of the soldiers, as I stared up into the
dark, straining almost painfully to see. Coeke leaned over and
whispered fiercely, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know the Archons had
wings, did you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was more <em>chrrrring</em> during the next
hour, the loudest&mdash;it drowned out the ensuing dialogue and
made even our most unperturbable players pause a second&mdash;came,
for no reason we will ever understand, after Burbank as the Porter gave
his &ldquo;equivocation&rdquo; speech:</p>

<p><em>Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine.
Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes: it provokes the desire, but
it takes away the performance. There&shy;fore much drink may be
said to he an equivocator with lechery. It makes him, and it mars him;
it sets him on and it takes him off; it persuades him and disheartens
him; makes him stand to and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates
him in a sleep, and giving him the lie, leaves him.</em></p>

<p>The <em>chrrrring</em> went on and on for almost
three minutes. The drone-hum of wings was so loud I expected to look up
to see the Archons flitting about this hive-tunnel space like so many
hornets.</p>

<p>Why? What could they possibly know of drunkenness or desire,
lechery or impotence? Much less the effect alcohol has on men before,
during, or after the sex act?</p>

<p>I looked at Agla&eacute;, still in her witch makeup and
costume. As if reading my mind, she shook her head.</p>

<p>In no time, in an eternity, it was over.</p>

<p>Malcolm&mdash;Gough&mdash;the new King of Scotland,
had his final words while Macduff stood there holding a fair likeness
of Kemp&rsquo;s head by the hair. It reminded me of the dangling
dragomen above.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That calls upon us, by the grace of
grace,&rsquo;&rdquo; boomed Gough-Malcolm,
&ldquo;&lsquo;we will perform in measure, time, and place. So
thanks to all at once, and to each one, whom we invite to see us
crowned at Scone.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those onstage bowed.</p>

<p>The dead rose and bowed.</p>

<p>Those of us in the darkened wings came into the circle of
light and bowed.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>No applause. Not a cough. Not even a <em>chrrring</em>
of wings. Silence.</p>

<p>After a moment of this excruciating nothing, the light in and
on our circle went out. We could see that the ledges and slabs above
were empty. Even the hanging dragomen were gone.</p>

<p>A trapezoid opened in a solid wall behind us. The gravity
sledge floated in.</p>

<p>Kemp, still in makeup, refused to board&mdash;or allow us
to board&mdash;until the dragoman standing by the cab gave us some
indication of what the Archons had thought.</p>

<p>The dragoman&mdash;I thought it was the same one that had
come to the church that morning, but was not sure&mdash;said,
&ldquo;You are no longer the Earth&rsquo;s Men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kemp opened his mouth but decided not to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From this moment forward, you are the
Heresiarch&rsquo;s Men,&rdquo; said the dragoman.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>We rendezvoused in orbit with the Archon warship exactly as
instructed. This was to be the first time we ever penetrated the
Pleroma following anything but a funeral barge. As far as we knew, it
was the first time that any human ship&mdash;player troupe, <em>perfecti,</em>
or physiocrat&mdash;had ever entered the Abyss behind anything but
a funeral barge.</p>

<p>It was also the first time that anyone other than a member of
the troupe had traveled with us in the <em>Muse.</em></p>

<p>I still thought the dragoman was the same one who&rsquo;d
come to the church and driven us to the keep, but I&rsquo;d seen
enough of them in the cone of Mezel-Goull to know they actually all
looked alike.</p>

<p>Once we were safely in the Pleroma, surrounded by that
objective golden glow, the dragoman had an odd request. He wanted to
see the <em>Muse.</em> Her&shy;self.</p>

<p>Kemp and Condella and Burbank and a few of the co-owners had
to confer about that. We had never let an outsider see the true Muse.
Except for when we were children trying to frighten each other, we
seldom went down there ourselves.</p>

<p>In the end, they relented. What choice did they have? Kemp did
ask the dragoman&mdash;&ldquo;Are you still in touch with the
Archon? Even though your&hellip; ah&hellip; hair&hellip;
isn&rsquo;t connected? Even here in the Abyss?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lipless large-eyed man-thing stared in a way that I almost
could have interpreted as amusement. &ldquo;We are always united in
the flame of Abraxas,&rdquo; he/it said.</p>

<p>It was from the Fourth Sermon to the Dead.</p>

<p><em>Good and evil are united in the flame.</em></p>

<p><em>Good and evil are united in the growth of the tree.</em></p>

<p><em>Life and love oppose each other in their own
divinity.</em></p>

<p>What the hell. They decided to let the dragoman visit the <em>Muse.</em></p>

<p>For some reason, Kemp beckoned me to join the four of them
showing the dragoman the way.</p>

<p>The body of the <em>Muse</em> slept through
eternity in a small compartment past the sleeping level where our bunks
lay empty, below the circular common room where a few of the others
looked up at us with unanswered questions in their eyes as we passed,
beneath the throbbing engine room where Tooley used to let me look in
through the thick blue glass at the star-flame of our fusion
ship&rsquo;s heart when I was a boy, down a ladder and through two
hatches into a space barely large enough for the five of us humans and
the drago&shy;man to stand in a circle around the fluid-filled
sphere in the center.</p>

<p>She floated there in the thick, blue liquid. Long dead but not
dead. Her body mummified. Her eyes long since turned to cobwebs. Her
breasts now flattened to wrinkled mummy&rsquo;s dugs. Her sex lost.
Her once-red hair mostly gone, the wispy remnants floating like a baby
chick&rsquo;s fuzz. Her lips stretched back to reveal all her
skull-teeth. Her arms were folded in front of her as she floated,
looking as fleshless and fragile as broken bird&rsquo;s wings, her
thumbs folded in flat against her fluid-shriveled palms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was she?&rdquo; asked the dragoman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one knows,&rdquo; said Condella.
&ldquo;Some say she was named Sophia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t answer if you asked her
through the ship?&rdquo; the dragoman asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t understand the
question,&rdquo; said Kemp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could ask her directly,&rdquo; said the
dragoman. The thought of that made my skin go cold.</p>

<p>The <em>Muse</em> spoke then, her voice coming
from the walls. I don&rsquo;t know if any of the others jumped, but
I did. &ldquo;We have exited the Abyss and returned to the Kenoma.
This system is not numbered. These worlds are unnamed. We are no longer
in the Archon warship&rsquo;s pleromic wake. Another craft has
taken control and ordered me to follow it until further notice. All
imaging surfaces are now active.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another craft?&rdquo; I said, looking from Kemp
to Burbank to the dragoman.</p>

<p>The dragoman was clutching his head so fiercely that his ten
spatulate fingers compressed white. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
gone,&rdquo; he gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s gone?&rdquo; asked Kemp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Archons. For the first time&hellip; in
my&hellip; existence. There is&hellip; no&hellip;
contact.&rdquo; The dragoman fell to the deck and wrapped his long
arms around his legs as he curled into a tight and rocking fetal
position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose ship is it then?&rdquo; asked Condella.</p>

<p>Black fluid ran from the dragoman&rsquo;s eyes and open
mouth as he gasped. &ldquo;The Poimen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the globe of blue liquid, the mummy of the <em>Muse</em>
writhed, extended her withered arms, and opened her empty eyes.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>We gathered in the common room. Tooley and Pig laid the
unconscious dragoman on an old acceleration couch; we could not tell if
he was still alive. Black fluid continued to seep from his mouth, ears,
eyes, and unseen orifices under his genital flap and none of the rest
of us wished to touch him.</p>

<p>Tooley wiped his hands and hurried to unroll viewstrips along
the curved outer bulkhead. Within minutes it felt as if we were on a
high platform open to three-dimensional space in all directions.</p>

<p>Kemp came down from above. &ldquo;The <em>Muse</em>
is not answering questions or responding to navigation
requests,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not even under
power. As far as we can tell, there&rsquo;s no pleromic wake, but
we&rsquo;re still under the in&shy;fluence of that ship pulling
us toward the gas giant.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>The</em> Muse <em>not answering
questions or responding to orders?</em> We all stared at one
another with terror in our eyes. This had never happened. It <em>couldn&rsquo;t</em>
happen. If the <em>Muse</em> failed, malfunctioned, died,
we were all dead. I remembered the flailing and stretching and silent
gape-mouthed screams of her mummy in the blue sphere below and wondered
if somehow we had all killed her by following the Archon warship
through the Pleroma.</p>

<p>I realized that the fusion thum and slight additional weight
of in-system thrust was absent for the first time ever in our
nonpleromic travels. The only thing keeping us from floating around the
room was the sternward pressure of the internal tension fields. At
least that meant that some power was still being generated.</p>

<p>Watching the scene through the huge viewstrip windows did
nothing to quell our terror.</p>

<p>We were hurtling toward a gas-giant world with a velocity the <em>Muse</em>
would never have allowed or been able to obtain. Ahead of us was a
bluish-gray ship, size impossible to determine without references or
radar that the <em>Muse</em> would not or could not bring
online even after repeated requests. The blue-gray ship seemed solid
yet was impossibly malleable, shifting shapes constantly: now an
aerodynamic dart, almost winged; now a blue spheroid; now a muscular
mass of curves and bubbles that made the missing Archon warship look as
crudely made as an iron boomerang.</p>

<p>Then all of us ceased looking at the ship towing us and stared
slack-jawed at the approaching world.</p>

<p>Worlds, I should say, because the green and blue and white gas
giant&mdash; there was no doubt it was a Jovian-sized
world&mdash;was accompanied by a dozen or more hurtling moons and a
ring.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d seen hundreds of gas giants in my travels from
Pleroma to the Archon worlds of the Tell, Jupiter and Saturn being only
the first and those only briefly glimpsed, but never had I seen a world
like this. None of us had.</p>

<p>Instead of the red, orange, yellow, and turqoise methane
stripes common to most such giants, this world alternated bands of blue
and white. Massive cloud-storms that must have been as large as
Jupiter&rsquo;s Red Spot swirled in cyclonic splendor, but these
were white storms&mdash;Earth-like hurricanes&mdash; and they
traveled along blue bands that suggested oceans of water thousands of
miles below.</p>

<p>This alone would have made us gawk&mdash;an Earth-like
gas-giant world of such beauty&mdash;not to mention the dozen, no
fifteen at least, no, now seven&shy;teen moons we could see
hurtling above the multihued equatorial rings that girdled the big
planet some tens of thousands of miles above its shimmering atmosphere,
but it was the signs of civilization that kept our mouths open and our
eyes wide.</p>

<p>To say the world was obviously inhabited would have been the
under&shy;statement of all time.</p>

<p>The gas giant was about two-thirds illuminated by its yellow
sun, but the dark slice beyond the curve of terminator was as
brilliantly lighted as the glaring blue and white daytime side.
Straight and winding strings of lights by the millions showed linear
communities or highways or flyways or coast&shy;lines or spaceports
or&hellip; we did not know what. Constellations of lights, by the
billions it seemed, showed cities or, because the constellations were
moving, perhaps just the denizens themselves, radiant as gods.</p>

<p>Buildings&hellip; towers&hellip; crystalline
structures rose out of the clouds and then out of the atmosphere
itself; not one or a few, but hundreds of them. They moved with the
revolution of the planet. Several rose not only through the atmosphere
but up through the orbital rings around the giant world&hellip;
rings which we now could see were made up of artificial moonlets or
structures by the million. The myriad of sparkling orbital objects
looked as if they were going to crash into the tallest crystal towers
with the speed of meteors, of comets, but at the last minute the
streams of particles&mdash;each object hundreds of times larger
than the <em>Muse,</em> we realized&mdash;parted like
a river current around a rock.</p>

<p>The space between the big planet and the moons was filled not
only with the countless objects that made up the equatorial rings, and
with the fluid-filled cords to the moons, but with more millions of
rising and descending flecks catching sunlight and throwing off their
own flames. Spacecraft, we presumed, rising and descending from the
world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Abraxas,&rdquo; whispered Burbank.
&ldquo;How tall are those structures?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We could see the towers&rsquo; shadows now, thrown across
entire continents below them, across seas of clouds. The base of each
tower was invisible be&shy;neath the white and
blue&mdash;perhaps the fluid-filled towers passed through the
entire giant world like so many crystalline stakes driven through the
planet&rsquo;s heart&mdash;but their summits and upper floors
rose deep into the vacuum of cislunar space.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hundreds of miles high, at least,&rdquo; said
Heminges who knew a few tech&shy;nical things.
&ldquo;Thousands, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; said
Condella.</p>

<p>The towing ship slowed and we slowed with it as we entered the
cislunar system.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at this,&rdquo; said Tooley, who had
pushed some of the viewstrips to their maximum magnification.</p>

<p>From farther out we&rsquo;d seen the writhing strands
rising from the world toward the many moons, but now we could see that
not only were they continuous&mdash;connected all the way from the
giant planet to the many hur&shy;tling moons, some of which must
have been the size of Earth or 25-25-26 IB, but the cords, each
anchored somewhere on the big planet, were transparent and hollow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those must each be three or four hundred miles in
diameter,&rdquo; whis&shy;pered Gough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; said Kemp.</p>

<p>Coeke nodded and rubbed stubble on his massive jaw.
&ldquo;It is impossible, but look&hellip;&rdquo; He stabbed
a blunt, black finger into the holo of the viewstrip.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something moving inside each connecting
thread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are those things bridges?&rdquo; asked Alleyn
in hushed tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More like umbilicals, I think,&rdquo; said
Hywo. &ldquo;Conduits. They&rsquo;re filled with liquid. Things
are&hellip; swimming&hellip; moving both directions in that
fluid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not possible,&rdquo; Kemp said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re closing on that tallest tower
pretty fast,&rdquo; said Philp.</p>

<p>He was right. Kemp, Tooley, and Burbank, our three most common
in&shy;terlocutors with the <em>Muse,</em> began
calling to her with some alarm in their voices&mdash;if we needed
to fire engines to brake, she needed to do it <em>now</em>&mdash;but
the <em>Muse</em> did not answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Abraxas, embracer of all opposites, terror of
the sun, heart of the sun, help us,&rdquo; prayed Old Adam.</p>

<p>A blue sphere about twelve feet across floated through the
hull. We clam&shy;bered and leaped to get out of its way.</p>

<p>At first, in my fear and confusion, I thought it was the
blue-fluid-filled globe below that held the mummy of the <em>Muse,</em>
but this was larger and something else. The blue was a different color
and the sphere glowed from within. There was a living being in the
water or fluid; the creature was golden, vaguely amphibian, and about
eight feet long. I could see a face of sorts, eyes of sorts, a slash of
a mouth or feeding orifice, large gills, gold and green scales, and two
vestigial arms, like those of a malformed fetus, with lovely small
hands.</p>

<p>Suddenly the still corpse of the dragoman spoke. &ldquo;We
are sorry we in&shy;jured this member of your species. He is no
longer living. We shall resurrect him to make amends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>None of us spoke until Agla&eacute; managed,
&ldquo;Are you the Poimen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did not mean to damage this unit while we were
taking your ship from the possession of the petty rulers,&rdquo;
said the dead dragoman, a black fluid as viscous as ink still running
from the corners of his mouth and eyes as he lay there on the couch.</p>

<p>I remembered my catechism, Father teaching me in the glass
room through the endless rainy afternoons on Earth. Centuries ago,
after our first contact with the Archons and the end of our
species&rsquo; rule of self, Abraxas had revealed four levels of
our masters, four stages of our own eternal evo&shy;lution should
our physical bodies be returned to Earth and our <em>psyche</em>
and <em>pneuma</em> be pure enough to ascend the four
circles.</p>

<p>The Archons were the petty rulers. The Poimen, whom no humans
in our lifetimes had ever glimpsed, were the shepherds. The <em>Demiurgos</em>
were the half-makers. (It was they who had created our faulty, failed
Earth and universe.) The Abraxi were the shattered vessels of Abraxas,
the ultimate God of Opposites.</p>

<p>The dragoman sat up on his couch, set his splayed feet on the
deck, and wiped ink from his lipless mouth. His synaptic filaments hung
down like wet vines. His black-rimmed eyes stared at us with no obvious
signs of alarm. &ldquo;What happened while I was dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before we could answer, he spoke again, but his voice had that
somehow flatter, infinitely more vacant tone it had held a moment
before when the Poimen amphibian in the blue globe had spoken through
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will be docking within moments. You will choose
one of your <em>mimesis</em> episodes for performance in
one hour and eleven minutes. An appro&shy;priate place will be made
ready for you. There will be those there to receive your images and
sounds&hellip; an audience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One hour and eleven minutes!&rdquo; shouted
Kemp. None of us had slept for at least thirty-six hours.
We&rsquo;d already performed <em>Much Ado About Nothing</em>
and the most successful performance of <em>The Tragedy of
Macbe&hellip;</em> the Scottish Play&hellip; that we had
ever seen, much less participated in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One hour and eleven minutes?&rdquo; he cried
again.</p>

<p>But the Poimen and its sphere were gone, floated back through
the hull and out of sight.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>The Poimen ship placed the <em>Muse of Fire</em>
gently in a niche near the top of the crystal tower&mdash;we passed
through some sort of tough but perme&shy;able membrane that held
the liquid inside, not to mention its inhabit&shy;ants, safe and
separate from the cold of space&mdash;and then other gold and green
and reddish and blue-gilled forms piloting small machines, open and
delicate jet sledges which they guided with their tiny hands, took us
down the thousand miles or two of flooded crystal column at an
impos&shy;sible speed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Supercavitation,&rdquo; muttered Tooley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; snapped Kemp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our one engineer seemed sullen since the <em>Muse</em>
quit speaking to him.</p>

<p>We spent most of the hour and ten minutes during the
descent&mdash;the water-scooter Poimen pulled and pushed us through
clouds and what seemed like blue and turqoise seas&mdash;arguing
about what to perform.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Romeo and Juliet,&rdquo;</em>
argued Alleyn and Agla&eacute;. Of course they would argue for that
play. It was theirs. Kemp and Condella and Adam and even Heminges were
old farts and demoted to secondary and tertiary roles in that play.</p>

<p>Kemp vetoed the idea. &ldquo;This may be the most
important performance we ever do,&rdquo; said the troupe leader.
&ldquo;We have to put on the <em>best</em>&mdash;the
best of the Bard, the best of ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said that yesterday,&rdquo; Alleyn said
dryly. &ldquo;For the Archons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it was true then,&rdquo; said Kemp. He
was so exhausted that his voice was raw. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
truer now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; asked Burbank. &ldquo;<em>Hamlet?
Lear</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Lear</em>,&rdquo; decided Kemp.</p>

<p><em>What a surprise!</em> I thought bitterly. Kemp
decides on the play tailored to Kemp on our most important performance
ever. The universe ages, Earth loses its oceans, the human race is
subjugated and turned into cultureless futureless slaves, but actors
still count lines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will I be Cordelia?&rdquo; asked
Agla&eacute;.</p>

<p>Of course she would. She&rsquo;d been Cordelia in the past
twenty perfor&shy;mances, with Condella as the infinitely rancid
older Goneril.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I will be Cordelia,&rdquo; announced
Condella in tones that brooked no opposition. &ldquo;You will be
Regan. Becca can be Goneril.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; began Agla&eacute;, obviously
crushed, &ldquo;how can you play&hellip;&rdquo; She
stopped. How can an actress tell another actress that she&rsquo;s
decades too old for a part, even when it would be obvious to the most
groundling groundling?</p>

<p>Kemp said, &ldquo;These are <em>aliens.</em>
We&rsquo;ve never seen these&hellip; Poimen&hellip; and
they&rsquo;ve never seen us. They can&rsquo;t tell our ages.
They almost certainly can&rsquo;t tell our genders. I&rsquo;m
not sure they can tell our <em>species.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then how in the hell can they get anything out of
the play?&rdquo; snapped Heminges.</p>

<p>I thought he had something there. But then again, I
remembered, the Poimen <em>were</em> gods&hellip; of a
sort.</p>

<p>The ship had been lowered to some appropriate depth, although
shafts of sunlight still filtered down through the clear blue waters.
It was as if we were in a blue and gold cathedral. Hundreds of the
Poimen, who weren&rsquo;t men at all despite that part of their
name (or the name Abraxas had given them), swam and shuttled around us,
some being pulled by their jet-sled craft, some using other means of
propulsion, some inside larger craft and looking out through
transparent hulls. The depths were also filled with larger submersibles
of varied design, some moving in obvious lanes but others shimmering
like gigantic schools of metal fish. Far below us, the waters grew
darker and larger things, living things I thought, moved with leviathan
slowness.</p>

<p>Kemp gave the assignments. I hoped for Edmund, of course, all
of us younger actors did, if we couldn&rsquo;t get Edgar, but
received the part of Al&shy;bany&rsquo;s servant. At least I
got to kill and die onstage. (I confess I&rsquo;ve never understood
that servant&rsquo;s motivation.)</p>

<p>Heminges was to be Edmund, the bastard in every sense. I think
I might have cast him as Edgar; Heminges is crazy enough out of
character to play Tom O&rsquo;Bedlam half the time. But Alleyn got
Edgar. Pope was the Duke of Cornwall, evil Regan&rsquo;s stupid
husband&mdash;I could see Pope squinting dubi&shy;ously at
Agla&eacute; (he&rsquo;d never had such a young Regan). Gough
got the good role of the Earl of Kent.</p>

<p>There was a tradition in Shakespeare&rsquo;s day for
Lear&rsquo;s Fool, a sort of holy fool, to be played by the same
actor who plays Cordelia&mdash;the Fool is never onstage when
Cordelia is and he disappears completely when her major scenes
begin&mdash;but this wasn&rsquo;t going to work with
tonight&rsquo;s casting.</p>

<p>I would have given my left testicle to play the Fool, but
Burbank got it.</p>

<p>Adam got the Old Man&mdash;what else?&mdash;and Philp
was the courtly, brave, and courting Duke of Burgundy. Coeke was to be
Curan, Gloucester&rsquo;s re&shy;tainer, and Hywo Gloucester.</p>

<p>The lesser roles, gentlemen, servants, soldiers, attendants,
and messengers, were quickly parceled out. We knew all the
parts&mdash;or were supposed to.</p>

<p>Pyk came up and tried to get Kemp&rsquo;s attention, but
our Fearless Leader was too busy making costume choices and discussing
staging&mdash;Christ, we hated theater-in-the-round and prayed to
Abraxas that this place would not be like Mezel-Goull.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Pig?&rdquo; I whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>Muse,&rdquo;</em> he
whispered wetly in my ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better come see, Wilbr.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I followed him down through the engine room, through the
double hatches, down the ladder to the tiny room holding the <em>Muse&rsquo;s</em>
sphere and mummy. I admit that I was a little nervous being in there
just with Pig after watching the <em>Muse&rsquo;s</em>
gyrations and eyes opening an hour or so earlier.</p>

<p>Her eyes were still opened, but no longer empty. They were
complete and blue and looking at me. No mummy now. The naked young
woman floating in the blue fluid was more beautiful and younger than
Agla&eacute;. Her restored red hair floated around her like a fiery
nimbus.</p>

<p>She did not quite smile at me but her gaze registered my
presence.</p>

<p>I said to Pig, &ldquo;Jesus Christ and Abraxas&rsquo;s
rooster&rsquo;s balls. Let&rsquo;s get the hell out of
here.&rdquo; And we did. But what I&rsquo;d actually thought of
in those seconds I stared into the resurrected <em>Muse&rsquo;s</em>
eyes was an old catechism line from Saint Jung: &ldquo;The dream is
like a woman. It will have the last word as it had the first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>Saying it was an extraordinary performance of <em>King
Lear</em> would not be praise enough. It was beyond
extraordinary. It would have won the laurel wreath at any gathering of
the Bard Troupes on Stratford and at any time in the last twelve
hundred years or more. The legendary Barbassesserra could not have
created a better Lear that night than Kemp did. His very
exhaus&shy;tion lent more credence to the king&rsquo;s age,
despair, and madness. And I have to admit that Condella was tragically
radiant and perfectly, absurdly stubborn as Cordelia. After a few
minutes, I forgot her age&mdash;so I had to assume the Poimen never
noticed.</p>

<p>The Poimen.</p>

<p>They allowed us to extend and light our own stage from the <em>Muse.</em>
The ship had recovered sufficiently to handle the stage and basic
lighting, al&shy;though the cabiri were not functional. We were
able to use our dressing rooms and regular arras and stage exits. But
we did not need a tent where we performed.</p>

<p>Our ship and stage were on a sort of shell within a bubble. I
have no idea what energies kept the bubble intact, our air recycled, or
the pressures of the alien ocean from rushing in. But the bubble was
invisible and it did not distort vision in or out as glass or plastic
would. We did not float around or bob; the stage felt as firm beneath
us as it had the night before at Mezel-Goull, but this was obviously an
illusion since some moments into the per&shy;formance we realized
that our stage and ship and bubble were rotating three hundred and
sixty degrees, even turning as they rotated. At times we were
completely upside down&mdash;the surface of the ocean invisible
beneath our feet and stage and stern of the <em>Muse</em>&mdash;but
somehow the stage was always <em>down.</em> Our inner ear
did not register the changes and gravity did not vary. (In fact, the
gravity itself was suspicious, since it felt one-Earth average on such
a gigantic planet.) But the turning and rotation were very slow, so if
one did not look out beyond the proscenium for any length of time,
there was no vertigo involved. When I did look, it took my breath away.</p>

<p>The water&mdash;if it was water&mdash;was incredibly
clear. I could see scores of the huge blue and green crystal towers,
each lighted from within, each with a central twin shaft filled with
rising and falling liquids and passengers, each rising into sunlight
and atmosphere above&mdash;where countless more of the Poimen
floated and flitted&mdash;and then into space above that, each also
ex&shy;tending down to the purple depths miles beneath us.</p>

<p>The Poimen floated around us by the thousands or by the tens
of thou&shy;sands. Without staring I couldn&rsquo;t tell, and
one can&rsquo;t stare at the audience during a performance, even
when the fear of vertigo <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> a
factor. I could see that they were not all the same. Shafts of sunlight
columning down from the rough seas above illuminated a bewildering
variety of Poimen sizes, shapes, and iridescent colors. Some of the
creatures were as large as Archon spacecraft; others as small as the
koi in funeral ponds on Earth. All showed the same sort of flat face,
black eyes, throbbing gills, and tiny arms, at least relative to their
body size, and delicate hands as our first visitor in the sphere that
had come through the <em>Muse&rsquo;s</em> hull.</p>

<p>Kemp and Burbank had gone on about how they hated performing
in theater-in-the-round as at Mezel-Goull, but here we were in a
theater of three dimensions, with audience above, to the side, and
partially beneath us, thousands of pairs of eyes focused on us from all
directions, and all of them moving in our constantly rotating field of
vision. A lesser troupe would have had trouble going on. We
weren&rsquo;t a lesser troupe.</p>

<p>Did the Poimen understand us? Did they get the slightest hint
of what our &ldquo;mimesis episode&rdquo; was about? Could
these sea-space creatures under&shy;stand the foggiest outline of
the themes and depths of Shakespeare&rsquo;s tale of age and loss
and ultimate devastation, much less follow the beautiful and archaic
song of our language?</p>

<p>I had no idea. I&rsquo;m sure Kemp and Burbank and
Condella and the others carrying the burden of the performance had no
idea. We carried on.</p>

<p>Burbank once told me that his father&mdash;who had led the
Earth&rsquo;s Men longer than any other person and who was almost
certainly the finest actor ever to come out of our troupe&mdash;had
said to him that <em>King Lear</em> precluded and baffled
all commentary because the experience of it was beyond theater, beyond
even the literature and art and music we had when humans had literature
and art and music. <em>King Lear</em> and <em>Hamlet,</em>
the older Burbank had told his son, went even beyond the false but
beautiful holy scriptures humans used to have before the Archons and
their superiors showed us the truth.The Torah, the Talmud, the New
Testament, the Koran, the Upanishads, the Rig-Veda, the Agama, the
Mahavastu, the Adi Granth, the Sutta Pitaka, the Dasab-humisvara, the
Mahabharata, and the Bible, to name only a few, were false but
beautiful, and important for evolving human hearts and minds, said the
elder Burbank, but all receded before the unfathomable truths of <em>Hamlet</em>
and <em>King Lear.</em> And where <em>Hamlet</em>
explored the infinite bounds of consciousness, <em>Lear</em>
delved the absolute depths of mortality, hoPel&eacute;ssness,
communication failed, trust betrayed, and the threads of chaos which
weave our fates.</p>

<p>I think those are some of the words and phrases Burbank told
me his father used. One does get in the habit of memorizing very
quickly when traveling with actors.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;d only been words to me until this
night&mdash;pleasant theatrical hy&shy;perbole (which is
redundant, Philp would argue, since all theater, however nuanced, is
mimetic hyperbole of life)&mdash;but this day, this night, <em>this</em>
perfor&shy;mance of <em>King Lear</em> made me
understand what Burbank&rsquo;s father had been trying to say.</p>

<p>When Kemp, as Lear gone mad and wearing his crown of weeds and
flowers, said to Hywo as the blinded Gloucester</p>

<p><em>If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.</em></p>

<p><em>I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester.</em></p>

<p><em>Thou must be patient. We came crying hither;</em></p>

<p><em>Thou know&rsquo;st the first time that we smell
the air</em></p>

<p><em>We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee. Mark.</em></p>

<p>and then Kemp slowly took off his crown not of thorns but of
faded flowers and tangled dry grasses and Hywo/Gloucester wept</p>

<p><em>Alack, alack, the day!.</em></p>

<p>only to have mad Kemp/Lear pat his back and console him with
absolute hopelessness&mdash;</p>

<p><em>When we are born, we cry that we are come</em></p>

<p><em>To this great stage of fools.</em></p>

<p>I wept.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad I was offstage and behind the arras, away
from those thousands of staring fish-eyes, because I wept like the
child I don&rsquo;t remember actually being.</p>

<p>By the time Lear carried his dead daughter onstage and
pronounced those five heaviest words in the history of the
theater&mdash;&ldquo;Never, never, never, never,
never.&rdquo;&mdash;I could no longer stand. I had to sit down
to sob.</p>

<p>And then the play was over.</p>

<p>There was no applause, no noise, no movement, no visible
reaction at all from the schools and congregations and aggregations and
flocks of Poimen in the blue beyond our bubble.</p>

<p>Kemp and the others bowed. We all took our curtain call.</p>

<p>The Poimen moved away in the sea currents and submersibles.</p>

<p>We stood there, exhausted, looking into the wings at the
players who hadn&rsquo;t played but who seemed equally exhausted,
and then, almost in unison, we looked at the dragoman where he sat
listlessly in the wings, elbows on his knees, eyes unblinking and
seemingly unfocused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; demanded Kemp, his voice almost
gone and as old-sounding as the dying Lear&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Did
they like it? Did they <em>hear</em> it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you ask me?&rdquo; said the dragoman in
his flat squeak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t they in <em>touch</em>
with you?&rdquo; bellowed Burbank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo; said the dragoman.
&ldquo;Were they in touch with <em>you?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Kemp advanced on the spindly dragoman as though he were going
to pummel him, but just then our bubble went dim as surely as if
someone had put a towel over a bird&rsquo;s cage.</p>

<p>The dragoman jerked to his feet, not to meet Kemp&rsquo;s
charge&mdash;he was not even looking at Kemp&mdash;and said in
a different tone, &ldquo;You have one hour and eleven minutes to
rest. And then you and your ship shall be trans&shy;ported
elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our view out the bubble had disappeared with the light. There
was no sense of whether we were being moved or not, but we knew from
the motion during the performance that something was dampening our
sense of inertia in this cage. We went back into the <em>Muse.</em></p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>None of us slept during those seventy-one minutes. Some
collapsed on their bunks or just stood in showers letting the hot water
run over them&mdash;all of the <em>Muse&rsquo;s</em>
systems were functioning now&mdash;but about half the troupe met in
the larger of the two common rooms on the upper deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; demanded Pig.</p>

<p>I thought our youngest apprentice had summed up the essential
question pretty well with those three words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re testing us,&rdquo; said
Agla&eacute;. She&rsquo;d been a brilliant Regan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Testing us?&rdquo; demanded Kemp. He and
Burbank and Condella and the senior members of the troupe were glaring
at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What else could it be?&rdquo; asked my weary
and oh-so-lovely Agla&eacute;. &ldquo;No one&rsquo;s ever
heard of a traveling troupe being forced to perform before the Archons
before, much less before these&hellip; <em>Poimen</em>&hellip;
if they <em>are</em> actually Poimen. We&rsquo;re
being tested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo; asked Heminges. &ldquo;And
why us? And what happens if we fail?&rdquo; He should have been as
exhausted as Kemp or Burbank or Condella&mdash;he&rsquo;d had
important roles in all three of the performances we&rsquo;d done in
the last forty-eight hours&mdash;but fatigue just made his face
look more handsomely gaunt and alert and Iago-cunning.</p>

<p>No one had an answer, not even Agla&eacute;. But I began
to think that she was right&mdash;we were being put to the
test&mdash;but I could think of no reason, after all these
centuries, that a traveling troupe, or the human race for that matter,
should be tested. Hadn&rsquo;t we been tested and found wanting
those first years when the Archon, on the order of <em>their</em>
masters we were made to under&shy;stand, ended our freedom and
cultures and politics and sense of history and dreams of ever going to
the stars on our own? What more could they take from us if we failed
their goddamned tests?</p>

<p>It made me want to weep, but I&rsquo;d already blubbered
like a baby enough during that extraordinary, never-to-be-repeated
performance of <em>King Lear,</em> so I went up to the
topside observation room to talk to Tooley for a few minutes, and then,
when the birdcage towel was lifted and the <em>Muse</em>
in&shy;formed us that we were in the Pleroma again in the wake of
the Poimen ship, I climbed down through all the decks to the tiny room
where the newly resurrected <em>Muse</em> floated in her
clear blue nutrient.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>I felt like a voyeur.</p>

<p>In my previous eleven years aboard the <em>Muse,</em>
I&rsquo;d rarely come down here to her tiny compartment. There was
no real reason to&mdash;the <em>Muse</em> spoke to us
through the ship, <em>was</em> the ship, and we were no
closer to her down here near the mummified husk she&rsquo;d left
behind so many centuries ago than anywhere else on the ship: less close
here really, since she seemed alive else&shy;where. But more than
that, I was scared to come here as a boy. Philp and I used to dare each
other to go down in the dark place to see the dead lady I rarely came
down here as a man.</p>

<p>But now I had, and I felt like a voyeur.</p>

<p>What had been a brown, wrinkled, eyeless mummy was now a
beauti&shy;ful young woman, perhaps Agla&eacute;&rsquo;s
age, perhaps even younger, but&mdash;I had to admit&mdash;even
more beautiful. Her red hair was so dark it looked almost black in the
blue fluid. Her open eyes&mdash;I did not see her blink but at
times her eyes were suddenly closed for long periods&mdash;were
blue. Her skin was almost pure white, lighter than anyone
else&rsquo;s aboard. Her nipples were pink. Her lips were a darker
pink. The perfect V of her pubic hair was red and curly and dense.</p>

<p>I looked away, thought about going back up to my bunk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said a soft
voice behind me. &ldquo;She does not mind if you look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I just about jumped straight up through the hatch eight feet
above me.</p>

<p>The dragoman stood there. His fibroneural filaments hung limp
on his pale shoulders. There were still black streaks and stains near
the corners of his eyes and mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in touch with her?&rdquo; I
whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s in touch with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is she saying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened to her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dragoman said nothing. He seemed to be looking at an empty
space between me and the blue sphere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who restored her?&rdquo; I asked, my voice
echoing now in the tiny metal room. &ldquo;The Poimen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>Archons?&rdquo;</em> It
did not seem possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does she want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dragoman turned his lipless face toward me. &ldquo;She
tells you that the two of you should come here when it is your turn.
Before you act.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two of us?&rdquo; I repeated stupidly.
&ldquo;Which two? Act on what? Why does the <em>Muse</em>
want me to come here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment the ship shook and I felt the familiar ending
of the buzz and tingle one feels when transiting the Pleroma, a sort of
vibration of the bones and rising of the short hairs on the arm, and
then came the slight but perceptible downward shift-shock I&rsquo;d
felt so many times when we transitioned back to the Kenoma of empty
forms. Our universe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jesus Christ Abraxas!&rdquo; came
Kemp&rsquo;s voice crashing over the intercom. &ldquo;Everyone
come up to the main common room. <em>Now!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>Tooley, Pig, Kemp, and the others had run viewstrips from deck
to ceiling around the large common room, and then added more strips
across the ceil&shy;ings. The <em>Muse&rsquo;s</em>
external imagers provided and integrated the views. It was as if this
deck of the ship were open to space.</p>

<p>There was no Poimen ship ahead of us. We had been flung out of
the Pleroma into this system like a stone from a catapult such as the
ones we&rsquo;d seen arbeiters on 30-08-16B9 use to move boulders
miles up the moun&shy;tains to build the Archon&rsquo;s keep.</p>

<p>We were hurtling toward a series of concentric translucent
spheres sur&shy;rounding a blinding blue-white star.</p>

<p>Each sphere was larger than the last, of course, but shafts of
brilliant sun&shy;light passed through each sphere to the next and
then through the last one out to us. The <em>Muse</em> put
up deep radar and other readings showing that there were more than a
dozen spheres, each one mottled with dark continents and painted with
blue seas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eyes of Abraxas!&rdquo; breathed Heminges.
&ldquo;This is not possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not possible in a thousand
ways,&rdquo; said Tooley. &ldquo;According to <em>Muse&rsquo;s</em>
data there, we&rsquo;re one hundred and forty-four AU out from this
star. There shouldn&rsquo;t be this much light reaching
us&hellip; or this first, last, sphere. Unless each sphere were
somehow refracting and refocusing the light&hellip; or
magni&shy;fying it&hellip; or adding to
it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>We all stared at Tooley. Usually he spoke only to explain how
he was un&shy;plugging toilets or greasing gears or some such. This
was by far the longest speech any of us had ever heard from him.</p>

<p>I remembered that an AU was an astronomical unit, the distance
Earth was from its sun. Most of the Archon worlds we visited lurked at
around one AU from their suns&hellip;</p>

<p><em>144 AU out?</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;There are a dozen spheres around this
sun,&rdquo; came the <em>Muse&rsquo;s</em>
strangely young voice. &ldquo;There are two separate but
intersecting spheres at one AU, one at two AU, then others at three AU,
five AU, eight AU, thirteen AU, twenty-one AU, thirty-four AU,
fifty-five AU, eighty-nine AU, and this outer one at one hundred
forty-four AU from the star.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fibonacci sequence,&rdquo; muttered Tooley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said the <em>Muse.</em>
&ldquo;But it seems oddly inelegant. A series of or&shy;biting
Apollonian circles would have put more spheres of varying diameter
within a closer radius to this star without the need
for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Muse!&rdquo;</em> interrupted
Kemp. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re approaching this outer sphere pretty
damned quickly. Shouldn&rsquo;t you be firing the engines to slow
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would not help,&rdquo; said the <em>Muse.</em>
&ldquo;Our velocity upon leaving the Pleroma was a significant
fraction of C, the speed of light. We have never en&shy;tered any
system from any pleromic wake at anything near this velocity. I do not
even understand how we can maintain our integrity at this speed since
the collision of isolated hydrogen particles alone
should&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean you can&rsquo;t slow us?&rdquo;
interrupted Condella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I can,&rdquo; said the <em>Muse.</em>
&ldquo;At my full thrust of four hundred gravi&shy;ties, it
would take me a little over eight months to bring our velocity down.
But we will impact the outer sphere in four minutes and fifteen
seconds. Also, the ship&rsquo;s internal fields protect
passengers&hellip; you&hellip; only up to thirty-one gravities.
You would be, as the old saying goes, raspberry jam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you <em>miss</em> the outer
sphere?&rdquo; asked Agla&eacute;. &ldquo;Steer around
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <em>Muse</em> only laughed. I had never heard
her laugh before and I&rsquo;m sure that not even the oldest
members of the troupe had either.</p>

<p>No one said anything for a while.</p>

<p>Finally, Burbank ordered, &ldquo;Show clock. Analog.
Countdown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A holographic clock appeared above a viewstrip, showing three
minutes and twenty-two seconds until impact. The sweep hand continued
moving backward toward zero.</p>

<p>Burbank wheeled on the dragoman who had been silent, great
lidless eyes downcast, standing away from the rest of us who were
almost forming a circle while staring at the clock and viewstrips.
&ldquo;Do you have any goddamned ideas?&rdquo; barked Burbank.
His tone sounded accusatorial, as if the dragoman had brought us to
this end.</p>

<p>It turns out that someone with no lips can still smile.
&ldquo;Pray?&rdquo; he said softly.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>What would you do with three minutes left to live? I
didn&rsquo;t pray. I didn&rsquo;t do anything else either,
other than to look at Agla&eacute; for a minute with more regret
than I thought it possible for a person to hold. I was sorry that she
and I would never make love. More than that, I was sorry that
I&rsquo;d never told her I loved her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One minute,&rdquo; said the <em>Muse</em>.</p>

<p>I suddenly wondered if this was the time the <em>Muse</em>
had mentioned, through the dragoman, when I should bring
Agla&eacute; to the blue sphere with me when&mdash;how had she
put it?&mdash;we should come there when it was our turn, before we
act.</p>

<p>No, it didn&rsquo;t seem that this was what the <em>Muse</em>
had meant. And it looked as if &ldquo;our turn,&rdquo; whatever
that might have been, would now never come.</p>

<p>The outer sphere filled all viewstrips. We could clearly see
the dark un&shy;dersides of continents and make out the actual
turning of the sphere itself. To give us some sense of scale, the <em>Muse</em>
superimposed an outline of the large continent on 25-25-261B against
one of the smaller continents now on the top viewstrip. It was a tiny
dot on the huge landmass.</p>

<p>Jaws dropped open but still no one spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten seconds to impact,&rdquo; the <em>Muse</em>
said calmly. Our speed became appar&shy;ent as we hurtled at the
airless wall ahead of us&mdash;a wall that now <em>seemed
flat</em> because it extended so far in each direction.</p>

<p>We struck.</p>

<p>We did not strike, actually, but passed through the seemingly
solid un&shy;derside, passed through a mile or two of ocean in a
blink of an eye, passed through five or eight miles of blue-sky
atmosphere above that, and then we were in space again, hurtling toward
the next sphere&mdash;the eleventh celestial sphere according to
the <em>Muse&rsquo;s</em> earlier description, one a
mere eighty-nine AU out from this impossible blue-white sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shed twenty-five percent of our
velocity,&rdquo; the <em>Muse</em> reported.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t&hellip;that&rsquo;s
not&hellip;how could we&hellip;&rdquo; stammered Tooley.
&ldquo;I mean&mdash;Abraxas&rsquo;s teeth!&mdash;even
if the sphere floor were porous, impact with the ocean and atmosphere
would have been&hellip; I mean&hellip; slowing twenty-five
percent from&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed the <em>Muse,</em>
&ldquo;what we just experienced was not possible. We could not have
survived. Such a deceleration could not have occurred. That much
kinetic energy could not have been dissipated without much
vio&shy;lence. Nine minutes until impact with the next
sphere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus we passed through the eleventh sphere at eighty-nine AU,
and then the tenth at fifty-five AU&mdash;although the <em>Muse</em>
informed us that it should be taking us many weeks to be covering these
distances, even at our velocity still some double-digit percentage of
light itself, and she suggested that time itself was out of joint in
and around the ship, but we did not care about that&mdash;and then
we approached the ninth sphere rotating at thirty-four AU from the
blue-white star.</p>

<p>The <em>Muse of Fire</em> bored through an ocean
just as the first three times&mdash; with Tooley muttering
&ldquo;hypercavitation&rdquo; to himself as if the word meant
anything&mdash;but this time we did not tear through the atmosphere
and into space again.</p>

<p>The <em>Muse</em> rose slowly, reached the top of
her arc, hung there a minute like a balloon hovering several thousand
feet above a great, almost-but-not-quite flat expanse of green fields
and forests and brown mountains, and then began to fall.</p>

<p>The <em>Muse</em> fired her engine almost gently.
We passed over a coastline and then over wide plains toward a range of
mountains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are to land on that mesa,&rdquo; said the
dragoman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s ordering us to land
there?&rdquo; demanded Kemp. &ldquo;The Poimen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dragoman smiled again and shook his head.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>The Archons were the petty rulers according to our Gnostic
faith, the Poimen the shepherds (although the gospels never told us <em>what</em>
or <em>who</em> they were shepherds of), the <em>Demiurgos</em>
were the architects, the fashioners, the true (but flawed and failed)
creators of our world and universe, and Abraxas was God of All
Opposites, Satan and Savior, Love and Hatred, and all other truths
combined.</p>

<p>Now, as we all stood outside our ship in the sweet, rich air
of this ninth-sphere world, the <em>Demiurgos</em>
approached from the direction that might have been north.</p>

<p>None of us had ever set foot on a world as beautiful as this.
From our high mesa we could see hundreds if not thousands of square
miles of green grasslands, rolling fields golden as if from wheat,
thousands of acres of distant tidy orchards, more thousands of acres of
apparently wild forest stretching off to the green foothills of a long
mountain range, snow on the mountain peaks, a wide blue sky interrupted
here and there by bands of clouds with some of the cumulonimbus rising
ten miles into the blue sky, rain visibly falling in brushstroke dark
bands far to our right, and more, a hint of our just-traversed
coastline and ocean far, far to what we decided was the west, and from
every direction the sweet scent of grass, growing things, fresh air,
rain, blossoms, and life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Heaven?&rdquo; Condella asked the
dragoman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you ask me?&rdquo; was the naked
dragoman&rsquo;s reply. He added a shrug.</p>

<p>That was when three <em>Demiurgos</em> approached
from the north.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d already seen living things during our minutes
alone on the mesa top&mdash;huge white birds in the distance,
four-legged grazers that might have been Earth antelope or deer or
wildebeest running in small herds many miles below on the great green
sea of grass surrounding the mesa, large gray shadows in the faraway
forests&mdash;elephants? rhinoceroses? dinosaurs? giraffes? any of
Earth&rsquo;s long-extinct large wild things?</p>

<p>We hadn&rsquo;t brought binoculars out and
couldn&rsquo;t tell without going back into the <em>Muse</em>
to use her optics and now we didn&rsquo;t care as the <em>Demiurgos</em>
approached.</p>

<p>We never doubted that these three were from the race of our
Creators, even though no image of our Demiurge or his species appeared
in our gos&shy;pels or church windows.</p>

<p>They were six or seven hundred feet tall&mdash;above our
height of three or four hundred feet above the lowlands here on the
flat-topped mesa even though the bottoms of their legs were on the
grasslands. They did not seem too massive for all their height because
two thirds of each of them was in the form of three long, multiply
articulated legs, each glowing a sort of metallic red and banded with
black and dark blue markings, the three legs meeting in an almost
artificial-looking metal-studded triangular disk of a
torso&mdash;like a huge milking stool with living legs, was
Tooley&rsquo;s later description.</p>

<p>It was the last hundred feet or so of <em>Demiurgos</em>
that rose above the three legs and triangular torso that caught our
attention.</p>

<p>Imagine a twenty-story-tall chambered nautilus rising from
that metallic torso&mdash;not something <em>like</em>
a chambered nautilus, but an actual shell&mdash;three shells here,
each with its characteristic bright stripes&mdash;and from the
lower opening of each spiraled shell, the living <em>Demiurgos</em>
itself.</p>

<p>At the center of each shell was the circular umbilicus.
Forward of that, over the massive opening, was a huge hood the color of
dried blood. Be&shy;neath that hood on each side were the huge,
perfectly round yellow eyes. Each black pupil at the center of each eye
was large enough to have swal&shy;lowed me.</p>

<p>And the word &ldquo;swallow&rdquo; did come to mind as
the three <em>Demiurgos</em> tripoded their way closer
until they hung over us; the great opening at the front of each shell
was a mass of tentacles, tentacle sheaths, orangish-red spotted
tonguelike material, horned funnels, and sphinctured apertures that
might have been multiple mouths. Each huge yellow eye had its own long,
fleshy ocular tentacle with a red-yellow node on its eye-end looking
like some gigantic infested sty.</p>

<p>These were our Creators. Or at least one of them had been some
twelve to twenty billion years ago. For Creators, I thought, they were
very fleshy and organic created things themselves, for all the beauty
of their huge spiraled nautilus shells.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d all stepped back closer to the open airlocks
and ports of the <em>Muse,</em> but none of us ran inside
to hide. Not yet. I was painfully aware that the <em>Dermiurgos</em>
closest to me could whip down one of those sticky tongue-tentacles and
have me in its bony funneled orifice in a second.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will perform a play now,&rdquo; said the
dragoman. &ldquo;The best one you know. Perform it well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kemp tore his gaze away from the gigantic tripods looming over
us and said to the dragoman, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in touch with
them? They&rsquo;re speaking to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dragoman did not respond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t they speak to <em>us?&rsquo;</em>
cried Burbank. &ldquo;Tell them that we want to talk to them, not
perform another play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will perform the best play you know
now,&rdquo; said the dragoman, his voice flat in that way it got
when he was channeling these other beings. &ldquo;You will perform
it to the best of your ability.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this a test?&rdquo; asked Agla&eacute;.
&ldquo;At least ask them if this is a test.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the dragoman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes it&rsquo;s a test?&rdquo; demanded Kemp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Burbank.</p>

<p>The dragoman&rsquo;s large eyes were almost closed. The <em>Demiurgos&rsquo;s</em>
huge yellow eyes above us never blinked but their ocular tentacles
moved in a way that seemed hungry to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happens if we fail?&rdquo; asked
Agla&eacute;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your species will be extinguished,&rdquo; said
the dragoman.</p>

<p>There was a roar of confused noise from all of us at that. The
<em>Demiurgos</em> leaned farther over the mesa, their
mouths and tentacles and eyes coming closer, and I picked up the strong
brackish scent of the ocean&mdash;salt and reeking mud tidal flats
and dead fish in the sun. I had a strong urge to run up the ramp into
the <em>Muse</em> and hide in my bunk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just not&hellip;
fucking&hellip; fair,&rdquo; Kemp said at last, speaking for
all of us.</p>

<p>The dragoman smiled and I admit that I wouldn&rsquo;t have
minded beat&shy;ing him to death at that moment. He spoke slowly,
clearly: &ldquo;Your species was excused upon first encounter
because of Shakespeare. Only because of Shakespeare. His words and the
meaning behind his words could not be fully comprehended, even unto the
level of the Demiurge who created you. In your world, then, man was
Abraxas&mdash;you gave birth to and devoured your own worlds and
words, embracing eternal weakness even while you blazed with absolute
creative power. You sought to build a bridge over death itself. All
higher powers beneath the Absence that is Abraxas&mdash;the lowly
Archons, the preoccupied Poimen, the race of <em>Demiurgos</em>
themselves&mdash;voted that im&shy;mediate extinction had to be
your species&rsquo; fate. But because of this one dead mind, this
Shakespeare, there was a stay of execution on this sentence not to
exceed one thousand and nine of your years. That time is up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We stood silent in the sunlight. There was the sound in my
ears of a single, huge, pounding heart, like the surf of a rising sea;
I did not know if the pound&shy;ing beat came from the <em>Demiurgos</em>
whose shadow fell over me or from me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will perform the best play that you
know,&rdquo; repeated the dragoman. &ldquo;And you will perform
it to the best of your ability.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We looked at each other again. Finally Kemp said, <em>&ldquo;Hamlet.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>The show went on. It took us half an hour to get into
costumes, review roles&mdash;although we all knew our roles for <em>Hamlet</em>
without asking&mdash;and slap on makeup, although the idea of the <em>Demiurgos</em>
noticing our makeup was absurd. Then again, those huge, unblinking
yellow eyes did not seem to miss anything, even though they stared
through their own waving mass of tentacles when looking forward.</p>

<p>I was Rosenkrantz when we performed <em>Hamlet</em>
and I enjoyed the part. Philp was Guildenstern. Old Adam had once told
us that on Earth, pre-Contact, there had been a derivative
play&mdash;not by Shakespeare suppos&shy;edly&mdash;which
featured Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern, those two lying but playful
betrayers. I would have loved seeing it, if it ever did exist. Hell, I
would have loved starring in it.</p>

<p>The other parts fell the way you would expect now that you
know our troupe&mdash;Alleyn as Hamlet, Old Adam as
Hamlet&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s ghost (a role our lore says the
Bard himself sometimes played), Agla&eacute; as Ophelia, Kemp as
Claudius, Burbank as Polonius, Goeke as Horatio, Condella as
Hamlet&rsquo;s mother Gertrude, Hywo as Fortinbras&hellip; and
so on. About the only profound talent in our troupe not fully used in <em>Hamlet</em>
was Heminges, who carried <em>Othello</em>-with his
powerful Iago, cast as the gravedigger. Now the
gravedigger&mdash;the official name in our &ldquo;Persons of
the Play&rdquo; list is &ldquo;First Clown,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Second Clown&rdquo; being the gravedigger&rsquo;s
companion played today by Gough&mdash;is one of the great roles in
all of Shakespeare, but it is relatively brief. Too brief for
Heminges&rsquo;s ego. But he made none of his usual protests this
time as we rushed to dress and finish our makeup. He even smiled, as if
performing for the <em>Demiurgos</em> to decide whether
our species would be annihilated or not was what he had always looked
forward to.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>None of us had slept for&hellip; I&rsquo;d lost track
of the hours, but seventy-two hours at least and I guessed many more
(transiting the Pleroma strangely affects either one&rsquo;s sense
of time or time itself)&hellip; and we&rsquo;d performed four
daunting plays: <em>Much Ado About Nothing</em> for the
doles and arbeiters and late-coming Archons, <em>Macbeth.</em>..
shit, I mean &ldquo;the Scottish Play&rdquo;&hellip; for
the Archons, then <em>King Lear</em> for the Poimen, and
now <em>Hamlet,</em> a play that is almost impossible to
produce and act in well enough to do it justice at the best of times.
One critic, it is said, back in the pre-Contact centuries, suggested
that because of all the failed attempts to put on <em>Hamlet,</em>
we&rsquo;d do better just to quit trying to perform it and to allow
everyone to read it.</p>

<p>Well, the <em>Demiurgos</em> did not look as if
they were waiting to be handed&mdash; tentacled?&mdash;copies
of the script.</p>

<p>Under the brilliant yellow light of the distant blue-white
star, the play went on. Waiting behind the arras with Philp for our
characters to enter at the beginning of act 2, scene
2&mdash;Hamlet&rsquo;s fellow students and so-called friends
confer and conspire with King Claudius and Queen Gertrude before going
on to try to trick Hamlet into revealing what the royal couple wants to
know&mdash;I kept looking up and around.</p>

<p>This ninth sphere-world from the sun we were on was so large
that we could not see the upward-curving horizons in any direction,
merely a strange glowing haze that might have been the
distance-distorted image of the inner wall rising up thousands of miles
away from here. But I could see hints of the other eight spheres inward
from us toward the sun. That was a sight I have no words for and
perhaps Shakespeare would have failed here as well&mdash;the size,
the crystalline clarity, the turnings within turnings, the shafts of
sunlight and quick-caught glimpses of color that might have been
conti&shy;nents and blue seas a solar system&rsquo;s leap
away&mdash;but it made me cry.</p>

<p>I was doing a lot of crying on this trip. I&rsquo;ll blame
it on the lack of sleep.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>When we had thought our command performance for the Poimen was
our last and ultimate test, Kemp and the others had chosen <em>King
Lear</em> for a variety of reasons, but perhaps because <em>Lear&rsquo;s</em>
infinitudes and nihilisms are more manageable&mdash;by man or any
species&mdash;than <em>Hamlet&rsquo;s</em>
ever-expanding paradoxes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the play a hundred times and performed in
it, usually as Rosenkrantz, more than half that number of times, but it
always knocks me on my ass.</p>

<p>In all of Shakespeare&rsquo;s other plays, the characters
that are larger than the play being performed&mdash;Falstaff,
Rosalind, Cleopatra, the night porter in the Scottish Play,
Mercutio&mdash;are either killed off or contained before they
escape the deliberately confined double-sphered space of the play and
the&shy;ater. Not so with Hamlet and <em>Hamlet.</em>
The play is <em>about</em> theater, not revenge, and is
both the ultimate experience of theater and the ultimate comment on
theater, and the strangely expanding consciousness of
Hamlet&mdash;who begins as a student character prince about twenty
years old and, &ldquo;within a few weeks in the time of the play,
ages to a wise man in his fifties at least&mdash; makes no pretense
of following any story line other than Hamlet&rsquo;s wildly
leaping thoughts.</p>

<p>I strutted and fretted my enjoyable moments on the stage. The <em>Muse&rsquo;s</em>
cabiri bots still were not working (Tooley had found that all their
organic parts were missing), so we extended the usual stage and acted
on with&shy;out lighting, which would have been redundant in the
bright sunshine anyway&mdash;and tried to make our entrances and
exits without looking up at the hovering shells and tentacle-mouths of
the three <em>Demiurgos.</em></p>

<p>My last scene was one that had been sometimes omitted in our
shorter performances of the play&mdash;act 4, scene 4, where we
encounter Fortinbras&rsquo;s army on our way to the sea to sail to
England, where Guildenstern and I are supposed to deliver Hamlet up to
his execution but, according to offstage events, Hamlet will steal King
Claudius&rsquo;s execution request and substitute
Guildie&rsquo;s and my names instead, so presumably this is my swan
song, and my last words to Alleyn&hellip; Hamlet&hellip; are
&ldquo;Will&rsquo;t please you go, my lord?&rdquo; but
Hamlet is pleased to stay and to give what I call his &ldquo;even
for an eggshell&rdquo; soliloquy. It&rsquo;s especially odd,
and I thought so this day under the shadow of the slowly shifting <em>Demiurgos,</em>
that Hamlet seems to be praising Fortinbras, who is little more than a
quarrelsome killing machine.</p>

<p><em>I see</em></p>

<p><em>The imminent death of twenty thousand men</em></p>

<p><em>That for a fantasy and trick of fame</em></p>

<p><em>Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot</em></p>

<p><em>Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,</em></p>

<p><em>Which is not tomb enough and continent</em></p>

<p><em>To hide the slain? O,from this time forth</em></p>

<p><em>My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth!</em></p>

<p>In other words, Hamlet&mdash;the paragon of human
consciousness and occa&shy;sional conscience (although he showed
little enough of that when he stabbed stupid-but-innocent Polonius
through the arras curtain and announced to his mother that he was going
to lug the guts to another room)&mdash;was prais&shy;ing bloody
action in a thug&rsquo;s nature rather than his own sublime
awareness of morality and mortality.</p>

<p>And then the thought hit me like a stab between the
ribs&mdash;<em>Where the fuck is Heminges?</em></p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>Still in Rosenkrantz costume, I ran up the ramp into the <em>Muse</em>
and be&shy;gan throwing open hull hatches and sliding down ladders
without my feet touching the steps.</p>

<p>Heminges was right where I expected him to be, in the <em>Muse&rsquo;s</em>
tiny room, but I hadn&rsquo;t expected the heavy
spade&mdash;the one the gravedigger was to use in his upcoming
encounter with Hamlet&mdash;in his hands. He&rsquo;d
obvi&shy;ously already taken half a dozen swings at the <em>Muse&rsquo;s</em>
blue globe&mdash;the meta-glass was chipped and a few hairline
cracks already extended from the niche where the spadeblade had
fallen&mdash;and he was winding up to take another overhand swing
when I leaped at him.</p>

<p>Heminges was fueled by a fanatic&rsquo;s rage&mdash;I
could see white froth at the corners of his open mouth&mdash;but I
was heavier, stronger, and younger than the professional Iago. I
grabbed the spade, we whirled, and I forced him back against the
bulkhead, but not before I&rsquo;d glimpsed the <em>Muse&hellip;</em>
the physical <em>Muse,</em> whoever or whatever she
was&hellip; floating in the red halo of her own hair, her newly
young breasts almost touching the metaglass directly be&shy;neath
the spade&rsquo;s damage, her arms passively down by her naked
hips, her palms forward, as if she were awaiting the next and final
spade blow almost with anticipation.</p>

<p>Heminges and I lurched around the small compartment with the
comic clumsiness of two grown men fighting each other to the death. All
four of our hands were gripping the long spade handle chin-high between
us. Neither of us spoke; both of us grunted. Heminges&rsquo;s
breath smelled of the whiskey we synthesized and broke out only after a
successful performance.</p>

<p>Finally my youth and terror-augmented
strength&mdash;combined with a lucky knee applied briskly to his
codpieced balls&mdash;turned the tide and I forced Heminges against
the bulkhead again and then up, up, the spade handle under his chin,
until his toes left the deck. He hung there close to helpless. One
final concerted press forward and I&rsquo;d crush his
Adam&rsquo;s apple with the handle, or just choke the fucking fool
to death.</p>

<p>Instead of smashing his larynx, I panted, &ldquo;What are
you <em>doing?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>His eyes, already wide, grew as round as the
dragoman&rsquo;s but much madder.
&ldquo;I&hellip;break&hellip;the
globe&hellip;&rdquo; he panted, breathing whiskey fumes all
over me, &ldquo;and the fusion reactor goes critical.
We&hellip; blow&hellip; those alien&hellip;
cock-suckers&hellip; to hell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bullshit,&rdquo; I said, dropping him so his
feet hit the deck but not relenting the pressure of the spade handle
against his throat. If I slammed it up under his chin, it would snap
his neck. &ldquo;Nothing can make the reactor explode. Tooley told
me so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tried to shake his head but it only resulted in the spade
handle rubbing more skin from his already reddened neck. <em>&ldquo;She&hellip;</em>
told me&hellip; it would,&rdquo; he gasped. His staring eyes
were looking over my shoulder.</p>

<p>I released the pressure and turned to look at the <em>Muse,</em>
the spade now hefted loosely in my hands. &ldquo;How did she tell
you?&rdquo; I asked Heminges without turning to look at him. He was
no threat. He&rsquo;d slid down the bulk&shy;head and was
sprawled on the deck, panting and wheezing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Through dreams,&rdquo; he managed at last.
&ldquo;She gets&hellip; into&hellip; my dreams. If the
reactor goes critical, we can blow a hole in this <em>Demiurgos</em>
sphere and all the air will rush out and&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped. He must have realized then how insane that idea
sounded. As if the <em>Demiurgos&rsquo;s</em>
home&mdash;the ultimate Creation of the Creators&mdash;could be
so easily damaged.</p>

<p>I did not speak to him then, but looked directly into the <em>Muse&rsquo;s</em>
blue eyes when I spoke. &ldquo;Did you really tell him that? Did
you really get into his dreams and tell him he could do this? If you
can turn this ship&hellip; your&shy;self&hellip; into a
hydrogen bomb, you sure don&rsquo;t need this aging Iago to help
you do it. What the fuck are you up to, woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <em>Muse</em> smiled sadly at me but no voice
came from the speaker grills on the wall.</p>

<p>I turned back to Heminges, stood over him, and handed him the
spade. &ldquo;Claudius, Gertrude, and Laertes are almost finished
with their scene,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Gough will be going on
with his pickaxe without you. He&rsquo;d just fucking <em>love</em>
to take your part and deliver your lines. He&rsquo;s always thought
he&rsquo;d make a better First Clown than you. I doubt if the
goddamned <em>Demiurgos</em> will notice that
there&rsquo;s an assistant gravedigger missing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was as if I&rsquo;d run thousands of amps of current
directly into Heminges&rsquo;s ass. He leaped up, steadied himself
on the spade, shot an angry look at the <em>Muse,</em> and
clambered up the steps and out. Actors, I thought, are nothing if not
predictable.</p>

<p>My hands empty now, I spent another long moment staring at the
naked woman in the blue sphere. I said nothing. This time she did speak
through the intercom, her words echoing in the otherwise empty ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That had to be done, Wilbr, or he would have found
a real way to damage the ship in his vain attempt at revolution. This
way, I would have been the only one injured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I still stared and said nothing. <em>Injured? The Muse</em>
had been dead for centu&shy;ries, the solid illusion of her naked
young body here notwithstanding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do bring her down here, just the two of you and the
dragoman, as soon as we enter the Pleroma,&rdquo; said the <em>Muse.</em>
Her lips did not move, of course, her mouth did not open, but it was
her voice.</p>

<p>I did not say, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; I did not say,
&ldquo;Bring who?&rdquo; I said nothing.</p>

<p>After a moment I turned my back, scrambled up the ladder, and
went out into the sunlight to watch the end of the play.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry that I used the word
&ldquo;brilliant&rdquo; and perhaps even
&ldquo;unprecedented&rdquo; when I described our performance of
<em>King Lear</em> earlier&hellip; and perhaps I even
used words like that to describe our performance of the Scottish Play
in front of the Archon, or maybe (although I doubt it) our staging of <em>Much
Ado About Nothing</em> for the arbeiters and doles the day
before&hellip; because now I have no adequate words to describe the
<em>truly brilliant</em> performance our people achieved
with this <em>Hamlet.</em> I&rsquo;d missed a few
minutes, to be sure, wrestling with Heminges and the spade down in the
storm cellar of the <em>Muse,</em> but I&rsquo;d not
missed so much that I didn&rsquo;t realize how truly
extraor&shy;dinary this show had been. Whoever the long-dead critic
had been, if he&rsquo;d been real at all, who said that <em>Hamlet</em>
should be read rather than seen to be fully appreciated&hellip;
well, he hadn&rsquo;t seen <em>this</em> performance.</p>

<p>Our people were half dead with exhaustion and tension by the
last line, but somehow that added to the verisimilitude and unique
quality of the performance. It was as if we had <em>lived</em>
these hours&mdash;eternities&mdash;with the Prince of Denmark
and his wit. Even those who hadn&rsquo;t acted or who had simply
been onstage as placeholders&mdash;the soldiers, attendants,
guards, messengers, sailors, followers of Laertes and so
forth&mdash;seemed as totally wrung out as Alleyn,
Agla&eacute;, Kemp, and the other principals.</p>

<p>Heminges, I should mention, was goddamned wonderful.
He&rsquo;s the only character in the play&mdash;a play in which
even the most inconsequential char&shy;acter speaks more artfully
than any man or woman now alive&mdash;who is a worthy interlocutor
to Hamlet. If language is a game&mdash;and when is it not with
Shakespeare?&mdash;then the gravedigger was the only player who
should have been allowed on the court with the fiendishly witty Hamlet.
&lsquo;&ldquo;Tis a quick lie, sir, &lsquo;twill away again
from me to you,&rdquo; the gravedigger says once, taking one of
Hamlet&rsquo;s serves and smashing it back across the net. (We know
about tennis through <em>Henry V.)</em></p>

<p>Even before they are fully engaged in their battle of wits,
Hamlet says of the gravedigger to Horatio, &ldquo;How absolute the
knave is. We must speak by the card or equivocation will undo
us.&rdquo; Burbank taught me that this is a sailor&rsquo;s
card, a shipman&rsquo;s card, that Hamlet is referring
to&mdash;one on which all thirty-two compass points are clearly
marked.</p>

<p>But <em>Hamlet</em> is a play in which no clear
compass points have ever been marked to guide either the actors or the
audiences. It ends, as Hamlet himself does, with far more brilliant
questions asked than answered. When Hywo as Fortinbras, his voice husky
with exhaustion and emotion, speaks the last words of the play over our
rough stage strewn with corpses.</p>

<p><em>Take up the bodes. Such a sight as this</em></p>

<p><em>Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.</em></p>

<p><em>Go, bid the soldiers shoot.</em></p>

<p>And all the living exited by march, carrying
Hamlet&rsquo;s body with them; we did not provide the sound effects
of the cannon shooting as we usually did.</p>

<p>There was only silence: a silence broken only by the gentle
afternoon breezes blowing across the mesa and the slight creakings and
stirring of the <em>Demiurgos&rsquo;s</em> triple legs
and metal girdles and many tentacles. Their great yellow eyes did not
blink. It was as if they were waiting for an encore.</p>

<p>Our dead sat up onstage. We actors, including Alleyn who was
almost staggering from exhaustion and Agla&eacute;, who was as pale
as the real drowned Ophelia, came back onstage, joined hands, and bowed.</p>

<p>The <em>Demiurgos</em> made no sound or new
movement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Kemp at last, still wearing
the dead Claudius&rsquo;s crown as he faced the silent dragoman.
&ldquo;Did we pass? Does the human race continue? What&rsquo;s
our grade?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are to return to your ship and seal
it,&rdquo; said the dragoman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fuck that!&rdquo; cried Kemp. He was shouting
now at the looming ship-sized shells of the <em>Demiurgos,</em>
I noticed, not at the round-eyed dragoman. &ldquo;Give us your
answer. Give us your verdict. We&rsquo;ve done our bleeding best
for every race of you alien pricks. Tell us <em>now!&rsquo;</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;You are to return to your ship and seal
it,&rdquo; repeated the dragoman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrrrrhh!&rdquo; screamed Kemp and threw his
crown at the tentacled maw of the nearest Demiurge. It did not quite
make contact.</p>

<p>We all went into the ship. The hatches were sealed. The
viewstrips showed the <em>Demiurgos</em> ambling away to
the north in their long three-legged strides in the short minute before
the mesa rock and grass beneath the ship glowed white, then yellow,
then turned into a long metallic funnel, and the ship fell&mdash;or
was flung&mdash;violently down and down and then out. The internal
fields all kicked on and we were frozen in place as the <em>Muse</em>
compensated for the deadly acceleration gravities assailing us.
Evidently they were within the thirty-one g&rsquo;s she could
handle. A moment later we abruptly transited to the gold nothingness of
the Pleroma&mdash;the <em>Demiurgos</em> had not even
bothered flinging us out through their tenth, eleventh, and twelfth
spheres before making the transit leap&mdash;and Kemp said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll interpret our being allowed to leave as a
passing grade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Allowed to leave?&rdquo; said Heminges.
&ldquo;They fucking well booted us out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Burbank said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get some
sleep,&rdquo; and everyone cheered rag&shy;gedly and we began
to head for our bunks. Some were so exhausted that they fell on couches
or the deck and were instantly asleep.</p>

<p>I sought out Agla&eacute; before she disappeared up to her
bunk cubbie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you trust me?&rdquo; I asked when
I&rsquo;d asked her to follow me down to the <em>Muse&rsquo;s</em>
level and she&rsquo;d grudgingly complied. It felt strange to be
alone with Agla&eacute; in the dim blue light with the naked female
form floating just a few feet away.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you trust me?&rdquo; I asked again when she
did not reply immediately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wilbr, what do you want? I&rsquo;m tired. Very
tired.&rdquo; She had every right to be, I realized.
Agla&eacute; had held important parts in all four plays
we&rsquo;d presented in the last three endless, continuous,
sleepless days and nights of strangeness. &ldquo;If you brought me
down here for&hellip;&rdquo; she began with a warning in her
voice.</p>

<p>We were interrupted by the dragoman coming down the ladder
after dogging the overhead hatch behind him. I&rsquo;d not told him
to come.</p>

<p>I turned to the <em>Muse</em> in her sphere. The
tiny cracks where the spade had dented the surface had not spread. My
guess was that the metaglass would have survived a thousand spade
attacks. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; I said to the
naked form.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In immeasurable distance there glimmers a solitary
star on the highest point of heaven,&rdquo; said the dragoman in
the <em>Muse&rsquo;s</em> voice, accurate down to her
new youthful energy. &ldquo;This is the only God of this lonely
star. This is his world, his Pleroma, his divinity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I knew the words so well I could have recited them myself. Any
of us could have. This was from Saint Jung&rsquo;s Seventh Sermon
to the Dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing that can separate man from his own
God, if man can only turn his gaze away from the fiery spectacle of
Abraxas,&rdquo; continued the <em>Muse&rsquo;s</em>
voice through the dragoman&rsquo;s mouth. I understood that she was
communicating with us this way so the rest of the ship would not hear.
But why? Why this sermon?</p>

<p>Agla&eacute; looked at me with growing concern in her
eyes. She didn&rsquo;t like this sermon coming from the
ship&rsquo;s soul, and neither did I. I shook my head to show her
my own confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man here,&rdquo; said the <em>Muse.</em>
This was the penultimate verse of the Sev&shy;enth Sermon, word for
word. &ldquo;God there. Weakness and insignificance here, eternal
creative power there. Here is but darkness and damp cold. There all is
sunshine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Muse</em>,&rdquo; began
Agla&eacute;, &ldquo;why have you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon hearing this, the dead fell silent,&rdquo;
continued the <em>Muse</em> as if Agla&eacute; had not
spoken, &ldquo;and they rose up like smoke rises over the fire of
the shep&shy;herd, who guards his flock by night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; Agla&eacute; and I said in
unison, out of habit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anagramma,&rdquo; said the <em>Muse,</em>
her voice lower, completing the Seventh Sermon with its sacred and
secret codicil. &ldquo;Nahtriheccunde. Gahinneverahtunin.
Zehgessurklach. Zunnus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alarm klaxons began blaring throughout the ship. More alarms
rang and bleated and thumped. The <em>Muse&rsquo;s</em>
voice&mdash;her old voice, probably a recorded voice, her voice in
rare alarm even as her face behind the metaglass stayed serene, her
eyes watchful&mdash;shouted out, &ldquo;Warning! Warning! The
airlocks are opening! The airlocks are opening! We are in Pleroma and
all hatches and airlocks are opening! Warning!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment the dragoman&rsquo;s neurofiber filaments
slipped through my skin and flesh and pierced the nerves at the base of
my skull. I saw filaments wrapping around Agla&eacute;&rsquo;s
lovely neck and doing the same. More filaments shot forward from the
dragoman&rsquo;s head, made contact with the metaglass, and then
passed through. The <em>Muse</em> extended her body so
that the filaments pierced her small, white breasts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Warning! Airlocks opening. All hatches opening. We
are in the Pleroma. Warning! Air pressure dropping. Don protective
gear. Warning! All airlocks are&hellip;&rdquo; came the
recorded voice at full volume from all speakers, but the words grew
tinier and tinnier and then disappeared completely as the last air
roared and hissed and flowed out of the ship through all of its open
airlocks and hatches and doors, while the golden vacuum of the Pleroma
flowed in to fill each compartment and all of our straining lungs with
its nothingness.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come out!&rdquo; commanded the voice, but only
Agla&eacute;, the dragoman, and I could do so. The others might
have been dead, their lungs and eyes and eardrums exploded. Or they
could be frozen in the vacuum-thick Pleroma like ancient insects in
amber. In either case, they could not move.</p>

<p>Agla&eacute; and I could do so and we did, laboriously
climbing the ladder, floating and swimming through the golden medium to
the airlock, then out into the Abyss. It seemed to take centuries. But
no one was in a hurry. The dragoman followed, his long spatulate
fingers and flattened feet pulling him and pushing him through the
golden nothing with easy, broad, flick-away swimming motions.</p>

<p>Abraxas was waiting outside. I was not surprised. I could feel
that Agla&eacute; was not surprised either, nor the <em>Muse</em>&mdash;who
was watching us somehow, I felt, even though the external imagers no
longer worked for those trapped inside.</p>

<p>When I say that we went&mdash;or swam&mdash;outside
into the Abyss, the Ple&shy;roma, it gives no real sense of the
experience. The Abyss or Void or Pleroma was not absence; it was
Fullness beyond all measure. It filled our mouths and lungs and eyes
and cells. Moving in it was a matter of will, not locomotion. Once
outside, there was no up, no down, no side to side. Agla&eacute;
and I willed and swam our way through the golden fullness to the long,
gray curve of the outer hull of the ship&mdash;the only thing,
other than Abraxas and us, that fouled the ineffable absoluteness of
the Pleroma. We could use the hull as down if we stood on it; as a wall
if we set our backs against it or near it; as a ceiling if we so chose.
It gave us reference. Everything else, other than Abraxas waiting,
was&hellip; ineffable.</p>

<p>I had learned that word in my catechisms as a child, but I
never under&shy;stood ineffable until this minute. Even as my mind
reeled with vertigo, it remembered the words of our Gnostic prophet
Basilides as quoted by Hippolytus some thousands of years before
Contact ended all context.</p>

<p><em>For that which is really ineffable is not named
Ineffable, but is superior to every name that is used&hellip;</em></p>

<p><em>Naught was, neither matter, nor substance, nor
voidness of substance, nor simplicity, nor impossibility of
composition, nor inconceptibility, nor imperceptibility, neither man,
nor angel, nor god; in fine, neither anything at all for which man has
ever found a name, nor any operation which falls within the range
either of perception or conception. Such, or rather far more removed
from the power of man&rsquo;s comprehension, was the state of
nonbeing, when the Deity beyond being, without thinking, or felling, or
determining, or choosing, or being compelled, or desiring, willed to
create universality.</em></p>

<p>This pretty well defined the Pleroma that Agla&eacute; and
I found ourselves floating in: a field that was at once boundless,
impersonal, indefinable, and ab&shy;solutely transcendental. This
was the <em>&ldquo;Ain Soph Aur&rdquo;</em> of the
Jewish Kabbalah and the Tibetan and Mongolian and Buddhist
&ldquo;Eternal Parent, wrapped in her Ever-Invisible Robes, asleep
in the Infinite Bosom of Duration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that pretty well described Abraxas as well.</p>

<p>The Abraxas who waited for us here, the incarnation He chose
to show us, held no surprises. This Abraxas was the Heavenly
Chanticleer, straight from the paintings in Gnostic churches throughout
the Tell: small as far as manifested Absolute Gods go&mdash;only
about six feet tall, a little shorter than me&mdash;and matching
our images down to his rooster&rsquo;s head, curled serpent legs,
and the whip he carried in one inhuman hand and the shield he carried
in the other. The stars with their resplendent rays and the <em>ogdoad</em>
symbol of the transcending seven planets were on his shield here rather
than floating behind him, but the center of the large gold shield was
taken up with a complicated design working the gold of the shield into
the face of the sun. Abraxas&rsquo;s eyes were not those of a
rooster, but rather the predator orbs of a lion. His mouth was mostly
beak, but the teeth and tongue were also those of a lion.</p>

<p>All in all, a modest visible incarnation for the God of
Totality, the Lord of Opposites, who not only stands outside of time
but rules outside of all mere religions as the reality of the eternally
available timeless moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will perform a play,&rdquo; said the
dragoman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What else
is new?&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I tell you &ldquo;the dragoman said&rdquo; or
&ldquo;I said,&rdquo; the words are not correct since the
medium of the Pleroma, which was not a medium at all, carried no sound.
There was no air in my lungs or in Agla&eacute;&rsquo;s lungs.
The Pleroma satisfied our brains&rsquo; and cells&rsquo; need
for oxygen, but it was exactly as if we&rsquo;d drowned in the
Fullness. I know that the other twenty-one members of our troupe were
writhing in terror in the ship, trying to move, trying to breathe air
that was no longer there, no more concerned about performing a
Shake&shy;spearean play than a fish out of water would have been
about working out multiplication tables as it writhed and flopped on
some hostile shore.</p>

<p>But something the <em>Muse</em> or the
dragoman&mdash;or both&mdash;had done to Agla&eacute; and
me allowed us to think, to move, and, by shaping the words with our
mouths and minds even in the golden absence of actual air, to shape our
thoughts to be heard as speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you perform?&rdquo; asked the dragoman,
presumably speaking for Ab&shy;raxas who floated before us.</p>

<p>I looked at Agla&eacute;. She nodded, but this was
redundant. After whatever we had experienced in the <em>Muse&rsquo;s</em>
room, this young woman and I were as in tune as two tuning forks struck
to the same pitch and vibration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will do parts of <em>Romeo and
Juliet,&rdquo;</em> I said. &ldquo;However much we can do
as a troupe of two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, neither Kemp nor Burbank nor any of the other elders of
our troupe would have chosen <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> as
one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s pieces to perform when the future of our
species&mdash;or even an important
per&shy;formance&mdash;was at stake. As appreciated as the old
standard was by arbeiter and dole audiences around the
Tell&mdash;and by the troupe itself, to tell the truth&mdash;it
was earlier, easier Shakespeare: brilliant in its parts, but never the
incomparable artistic achievement that was <em>King Lear</em>
or <em>Hamlet</em> or <em>Othello</em> or <em>The
Tempest</em> or even the Scottish Play.</p>

<p>What were our choices? It would have made more sense to put on
<em>The Tempest</em> before the God of the Sun and
Darkness, dealing as it does with the ultimate magus, magic, enchanted
islands, captured races turned into slaves, and the end of control,
probably Shakespeare&rsquo;s farewell to the theater if Kemp in his
cups is to be believed&mdash;literally the drowning of
Prospero&rsquo;s Books.</p>

<p>But I couldn&rsquo;t have done Prospero on my best day.
I&rsquo;d never been under&shy;study for Prospero and had had
no regular role on the rare occasions when we produced it. And however
we might abridge <em>The Tempest,</em> it would never make
a workable two-person production for Agla&eacute; and me.</p>

<p>Of course, neither would <em>Romeo and Juliet,</em>
but I regularly played Samson in the opening
scenes&mdash;&ldquo;No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you,
sir, but I bite my thumb, sir&rdquo;&mdash;and I&rsquo;d
been understudy for Alleyn as Romeo on multiple occasions. And
Agla&eacute; was wonderful as Juliet.</p>

<p>And so we started.</p>

<p>We decided to use the hull as a sort of wall behind us, better
to define the stage in our minds and to reach back to touch if the
pleromic vertigo became too bad. Other than the absurd rooster-headed
Abraxas&mdash;soli&shy;tary King, Bond of Invisibility, Breaker
of the Cycles of Bondage, and First Power&mdash;there
wasn&rsquo;t anything to look at or hold on to out there in the
Pleroma except the dragoman and the hull. And Agla&eacute;. I
looked at her, nodded, and floated forward a few yards.</p>

<p><em>Two households, both alike in dignity,</em></p>

<p><em>In fair Verona (where we lay our scene),</em></p>

<p><em>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</em></p>

<p><em>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</em></p>

<p><em>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</em></p>

<p><em>A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life;</em></p>

<p><em>Whose misadventured piteous overthrows</em></p>

<p><em>Doth with their death bury their parents&rsquo;
strife.</em></p>

<p>Agla&eacute; was watching me intently, wondering, I am
sure, if I was going to do the entire Chorus&rsquo;s part, but I
wasn&rsquo;t sure of the last part so I broke off there. Then I
raised my arms and said conversationally in the direction of Abraxas,
who was now seated on a gold throne that had not been there a second
before, &ldquo;Imagine, if you will, two young men, Samson and
Gregory, of the house of Capulet, entering in swords and
bucklers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then I did act out all the parts between Samson and
Gregory&mdash;I knew these lines well enough&mdash;and after
that, quickly explaining the situation to the dragoman and the Lord of
Light and Darkness in easily improvised phrases, I acted out the
entrance of Abraham and a serving man of the House of Montague. In
other words, I got to deliver my &ldquo;but I bite my thumb,
sir&rdquo; line after all.</p>

<p>Agla&eacute; had crossed her arms. I could read her
thought. <em>Will you be doing Juliet as well?</em></p>

<p>Instead I improvised a clumsy little summary of Montague and
Benvolio&rsquo;s scene&mdash;I&rsquo;d played Benvolio once
before when Philp was ill&mdash;and then sum&shy;marized the
coming scene between Benvolio and Romeo, stepping into character when
it came time for Romeo&rsquo;s major lines and
speeches&mdash;he was smitten and love-sodden already, you
remember&mdash;but, we learn, with Fair Rosaline, not Juliet.
Shakespeare, never all that interested in logic or verisimilitude, was
asking us to believe that in that small town where the Montagues and
the Capulets had been entwined with enmity for centuries like a
climbing vine on an ancient trellis, Romeo had somehow not seen, or
even heard of, Juliet yet.</p>

<p>I stepped&mdash;or floated&mdash;back. Taking her cue
perfectly, Agla&eacute; moved forward facing Abraxas, summarized
the scene with old Capulet, Paris, and the clown servingman Peter in
just a few words, and then launched into the third scene where she
played Capulet&rsquo;s wife, the inimitable Nurse, and Juliet
herself. Agla&eacute;&rsquo;s voice was never so beautiful as
when she spoke for Juliet&mdash;a girl-woman only thirteen years
old in Shakespeare&rsquo;s mind. My Romeo was five years younger
than I in real life&hellip; &ldquo;real life&rdquo; being
the mind of the Bard.</p>

<p>And so our play advanced.</p>

<p>For the next scene, I summarized Benvolio&rsquo;s parts
but found that I could do most of Mercutio&rsquo;s amazing lines
perfectly from memory. &ldquo;If love be rough with you, be rough
with love: Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.&rdquo;
I&rsquo;d seen Mercutio performed by the best men of our troupe and
now I added my own little bits of business with closed fist and thrust
forearm for the pricking lines, picking up Mercutio&rsquo;s madness
and Romeo&rsquo;s naive responses without hesitating a nanosecond
between the wide shifts in tone and voice and posture and mannerism.</p>

<p>All my life, I realized, I&rsquo;d wanted to do the Queen
Mab speech, and now I did, babbling on about the tiny
fairies&rsquo; midwife, her wagon&rsquo;s spokes made of
spinners&rsquo; legs, the cover, the wings of grasshoppers, her
whip of cricket bone&hellip; faster and faster, madder and madder,
a tortured young man with eloquence rivaling Shakespeare&rsquo;s
but none of the solid, business side of the Bard; Mercutio, a man in
love with his own words and willing to follow words where they led even
as they led him to madness&hellip;</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace! Thou
talk&rsquo;st of nothing,&rsquo;&rdquo; I interrupted
myself in my Romeo voice, alarmed now at my much more brilliant
friend&rsquo;s frenzy, shifting my body in space through three
dimensions as if shaking the space where I&rsquo;d stood as
Mercutio an instant before.</p>

<p>And so the play slid forward in that timeless spaceless space.</p>

<p>I realized almost at once that Agla&eacute; was better at
improvising the sum&shy;maries than I&mdash;and she could
remember most of the other players&rsquo; lines and the
Chorus&rsquo;s long speeches word for word when she wanted to
retrieve any of them&mdash;so I let her take the lead, only
stepping in as Romeo or Mercutio or Tybalt for key lines, and then only
a few. It was as if we were skipping across the surface of a pond,
saving ourselves from falling in only through our speed and
unwillingness to fall and drown.</p>

<p>Then it was our first encounter, our first scene together as
our real char&shy;acters, all thoughts of Rosaline out of my
teenaged mind now, my heart and soul and stirring prick focused forever
more on the transcendent image of my Juliet&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O she doth teach the torches to burn
bright!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We asked the unmoving Abraxas to imagine the party,
Tybalt&rsquo;s anger, Capulet&rsquo;s restraint of the young
firebrand, the singing, the dancing, the men and women in bright colors
and masks, and all the while young Romeo fol&shy;lowing, almost
stalking, young Juliet. Our banter had the urgency of youth and love
and lust and of the reality&mdash;shared by so few in all of
time!&mdash;of truly having found the one person in the cosmos
meant for you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too
much,&rsquo;&rdquo; whispered Juliet/Agla&eacute;.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Which mannerly devotion shows in
this&hellip;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A second later I leaned close to
her.&rdquo;&lsquo;Have not saints lips, and holy
palm&shy;ers, too?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in
prayer.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O then, dear saint, let lips do what
hands do. They&hellip;pray.&rsquo;&rdquo; And I sent my
palm against hers and we both pressed hard. &ldquo;&lsquo;Grant
thou, lest faith turn to despair.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>When we did kiss a few seconds later, it was&mdash;for
both of us, I could feel&mdash; unlike any kiss or physical
experience either of us had ever known. It lasted a very long time. I
touched her thoughts as well as her lips. Her trust&mdash;never
fully given before, I understood at that instant, chased by so many
men, stolen by a few, betrayed by all others&mdash;opened warmly
around me.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>She floated above me during the balcony scene. It was the
first time I&rsquo;d ever understood the depth and youthful
shallowness and hope in those lines I&rsquo;d heard too many times
before.</p>

<p>I was Mercutio and Benvolio and Romeo in coming scenes, even
while Agla&eacute; delivered selected lines from the Nurse and from
Peter.</p>

<p>She summarized Friar Lawrence&rsquo;s part except for
certain responses to her Juliet.</p>

<p>Suddenly I found myself acting out Mercutio&rsquo;s verbal
taunts with Tybalt, Benvolio&rsquo;s failed attempts to intervene,
Romeo&rsquo;s joyful interruption, the mock fight between Tybalt
and Mercutio that led to Mercutio being slain under Romeo&rsquo;s
arm.</p>

<p>To an observer&mdash;and in a real sense Abraxas was the
only observer, since the dragoman&rsquo;s eyes and ears were
presumably just conduits to Him&mdash;it must have looked as if I
were having an epileptic fit in freefall, babbling at myself, twisting,
floating, lunging with invisible epees, moaning, dying. &ldquo;They
have made worms&rsquo; meat of me,&rdquo; cries Mercutio.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O!&rdquo; cries Romeo. &ldquo;I am
fortune&rsquo;s fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>In act 3, scene 5, Agla&eacute; and I made love. We
actually made love.</p>

<p>We had not intended to do it, even as our thoughts flew
between us like messenger doves during the intimacy of our almost
perfect improv. <em>I</em> had not thought of doing it.</p>

<p>But as the scene opens but before Juliet says &ldquo;Wilt
thou be gone? It is not yet near day,&rdquo; our stage directions
say only that we are both aloft, with a ladder of cords, but Kemp had
often staged it with Romeo and Juliet half-dressed on a couch standing
in for their marriage bed. Offstage, of course, between scenes, had
been Romeo and Juliet&rsquo;s one night of bliss as man and
wife&mdash;a very few hours of realized love before the lark
pierced the fearful hollow of their ears and never, as fate would have
it, to be followed by an&shy;other night or moment of intimacy.</p>

<p>But before Agla&eacute; spoke that first
line&mdash;she hesitated, her eyes on mine, the God and dragoman
forgotten by both of us&mdash;I began to undress her. She rushed to
undress me.</p>

<p>But the lovemaking was not rushed. I have no need to describe
it here and you have no need to hear details, but trust me that there
was nothing rushed, nothing self-conscious, no sense of doom or
finality, no awareness of other eyes on us&mdash;neither divine nor
dragomanic&mdash;and we made love as joyously and slowly and then
as impetuously and wildly as Romeo and Juliet would have at their age
and in their depths of first-love rapture.</p>

<p>I did love her. Juliet. Agla&eacute;. My love. My life.</p>

<p>We half-dressed afterward, she delivered her &ldquo;Wilt
thou be gone?&rdquo; line, we laughed and debated whether it was
the lark or the nightingale&mdash;the former meant death to me from
Juliet&rsquo;s family, but I laughed out, &ldquo;&lsquo;Let
me be ta&rsquo;en, let me be put to death. I am content, so thou
wilt have it so.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>That wakens her to the morn and danger. She all but shoves me
out with protests and final kisses and more final hugs and kisses.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d forgotten Abraxas. Forgotten the floating
dragoman with the un&shy;blinking eyes. I&rsquo;d forgotten
everything but my performance and the truth beneath it&mdash;which
was my body still vibrating like a struck bell because of my lovemaking
with Agla&eacute; and the knowledge that should the human race or
universe itself end tomorrow, it was all worth it for these
mo&shy;ments.</p>

<p>It was in our final tomb scene together that I realized that
we were prob&shy;ably going to die then and there.</p>

<p>Our lovemaking had been spontaneous but real.</p>

<p>Our love was new but real.</p>

<p>The lines we were delivering had never been delivered like
this by living actors in all the history of time or theater. Our
energies were absolute. Our emotions all real.</p>

<p>I was sure that when I pantomimed drinking the poison in
Juliet&rsquo;s tomb, I would feel the cold spread of the true
apothecary&rsquo;s poison actually move through my veins like
death-ice. And then, a moment later, when Agla&eacute; pantomimed
my dagger entering her breast, real blood would flow into the Pleroma
and she would die.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s to my
love,&rsquo;&rdquo; I whispered anyway, holding up the
imaginary bottle and drinking it all down. &ldquo;&lsquo;O true
apothecary. Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I
die.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The kiss was brief. I was dying after all. I fell, floating
slowly away from where she floated horizontally in the golden glow.</p>

<p>I did not die. Nor did Agla&eacute;&rsquo;s
make-believe dagger pierce an all-too-real and beating heart. The show
went on. I summarized Friar Lawrence&rsquo;s lines, the
Page&rsquo;s, the Watchmen&rsquo;s, then Agla&eacute;
reported Capulet&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s and Montague&rsquo;s
sorrow in snippets of dialogue, and then I delivered
Balthasar&rsquo;s and the Prince&rsquo;s important lines.</p>

<p>Agla&eacute; floated dead again while I boomed out in a
prince&rsquo;s royal voice.</p>

<p><em>A glooming peace this morning with it brings,</em></p>

<p><em>The sun for sorrow will not show his head.</em></p>

<p><em>&nbsp;Go hence to have more talk of these sad
things;</em></p>

<p><em>Some shall be pardoned, and some punished:</em></p>

<p><em>For never was a story of more woe</em></p>

<p><em>Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.</em></p>

<p>Agla&eacute; floated upright next to me and took my hand.
We bowed together in Abraxas&rsquo;s direction.</p>

<p>The God who was also the Devil, the apotheosis of Night and
Day com&shy;bined, did not move. His rooster eyes did not blink.
His arms on the throne were still. His serpent legs with their serpent
heads and fangs and serpent eyes did not stir or slither.</p>

<p>Agla&eacute; and I looked to the dragoman.</p>

<p>Time did not move in this timeless place, but I could feel
Agla&eacute;&rsquo;s heart&shy;beats and my own. We lived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; I said to the dragoman at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Return to your ship,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; I said. Agla&eacute; and I
kicked forward together, floating closer to the throne and the God
Above Gods seated on it. We could clearly see the lion teeth in the
huge rooster beak as we came closer.</p>

<p>We stopped in front of Him. &ldquo;Do you have anything to
say to us?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak now,&rdquo; said Agla&eacute; to the
thing on the throne, &ldquo;or forever hold your peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abraxas did not stir or blink.</p>

<p>I raised my fist and brought it down hard on the
God&rsquo;s head. The chanti&shy;cleer coxcomb and skull
cracked and fell away when I struck again.</p>

<p>Agla&eacute;&rsquo;s small fists pounded His chest. It
also cracked and then opened, showing hollowness inside.</p>

<p>The Unlikely Likely One, the All-Powerful in the Realms of
Reality and Unreality, was as hollow and fragile as a plaster statue.</p>

<p>We turned to look at the dragoman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always been you,&rdquo; said
Agla&eacute;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the naked form.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get back into the <em>Muse</em>
before you catch your death of cold out here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>The <em>Muse</em> sealed the airlocks, pumped the
Pleroma out, released real air into the ship from storage tanks, and
the twenty-one other members of our troupe began gasping and gagging
and coughing and retching. All had survived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There have been alterations,&rdquo; came the <em>Muse&rsquo;s</em>
voice through the inter&shy;coms. &ldquo;I can transit the
Pleroma on my own now. To anywhere in the Tell or beyond. Where would
you have us go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without really thinking or waiting for Kemp or Burbank or
Condella or the others&mdash;even my beloved
Agla&eacute;&mdash;to respond, I said,
&ldquo;25-25-261B.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This transit took less than thirty minutes.</p>

<p>As much as we all wanted to crawl to our bunks and sleep for a
month, most of us showered and dressed in our clean ship tunics and
gathered in the common room, where Kemp and other older
ones&mdash;still thinking they commanded the ship or their
destinies&mdash;demanded to know what had hap&shy;pened in the
Pleroma. I let Agla&eacute; tell them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was Abraxas&rsquo;s verdict
then?&rdquo; asked Heminges. &ldquo;On whether the human race
continues or ends?&rdquo; Agla&eacute; had left out the part
where we had found our God to be brittle, dead, false, and hollow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;ll see on
25-25-261B,&rdquo; I said just as the <em>Muse</em>
announced that we had exited the Pleroma and were approaching the
planet.</p>

<p>The <em>Muse</em> roared down through cloud and
sky on her thundering three-mile-long pillar of fire. It was daytime
and the hot winds were howling in from the high desert above the
arbeiters&rsquo; and doles&rsquo; plateau.</p>

<p>We suited up in hot condition suits and filter masks and went
out anyway.</p>

<p>What we&rsquo;d seen from orbit was true: the arbeiter
barracks were empty, the dole hovels and offices deserted, the mushroom
mine works abandoned and silent except for the howling of the wind.</p>

<p>Everyone was gone.</p>

<p>We returned to the ship and I ordered it to rise and hover
near the Archon keep.</p>

<p>The stone-steel walls were there, but only a shell now. It
looked as if a great fire had consumed every part of the interior.
Embers still glowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is everyone?&rdquo; I asked the dragoman.</p>

<p>He showed spatulate fingers in an openhanded gesture even
while he gave his small-shouldered shrug. &ldquo;Perhaps the
Archons have gone home&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean the goddamned
Archons,&rdquo; I interrupted. &ldquo;I mean the people. The
human beings. The slaves. The people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If he had shrugged again, or smiled, I would have killed him
then&mdash;be he dragoman or divinity or both&mdash;but he only
said, &ldquo;Perhaps you failed your tests and your people are no
more. Gone from the galaxy, with your troupe soon to follow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said. It was not a protest, merely
a statement of certainty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps some&hellip; force&hellip; has
removed them from all worlds in the Tell where they were in bondage and
sent them home to Earth,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>I shook my head. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not room enough
on Earth, even without the oceans, even if the goddamned tombs were to
be torn down, for the billions upon billions of us from the
Tell,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps the oceans are being refilled and
the&hellip;goddamned tombs&hellip; torn down as we
speak,&rdquo; said the dragoman. &ldquo;And perhaps your kind
has been returned also to more Earthlike worlds&mdash;beyond the
Tell, perhaps even among the Spheres, where they can resume their
stumble toward their destiny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in the hell is this&hellip; <em>thing</em>&hellip;
babbling about?&rdquo; demanded Kemp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This <em>thing</em> is more God than
Abraxas or the Poimen or the Archons were or will ever be,&rdquo; I
said tiredly.</p>

<p>Kemp and the others could only stare with their mouths open. I
think all of our mouths were open. We were all learning to breathe air
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was never really a test of <em>us,</em>
was it?&rdquo; I asked the dragoman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only in the sense that every one of your
performances is always a test,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you were testing <em>them,&rdquo;</em>
I said. &ldquo;The Archons. The Poimen. The <em>Demiurgos.</em>
Even Abraxas, if there is such a thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the dragoman. &ldquo;There
is no Abraxas, but there are the Abraxi. They <em>are</em>
the Pleroma. Think of them as a sort of primal cosmic zooplankton. They
are not very intelligent and make piss-poor gods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did all these species pass?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not all of them.&rdquo; The dragoman walked
past us and looked at the Archon keep a mile below us. &ldquo;Do
you want that to remain?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said. While the others were trying
to understand what we were talking about, I said to the <em>Muse,</em>
&ldquo;Full fusion thrust, please. Melt that place to
slag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <em>Muse</em> did what I asked. We felt the
internal fields press around us as the ship leaped back into space.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you really dead?&rdquo; I asked the
dragoman. &ldquo;Did the Poimen really resurrect you from the
dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was. They thought they did. I have allowed others
to believe the same in other places and at other times. Illusions are
important for children, espe&shy;cially illusions about oneself or
one&rsquo;s place in the universe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they know who you are? What you are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the dragoman. He showed his
thin, lipless smile again. &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before I could speak&mdash;and I do not know to this day
what I was about to say&mdash;the dragoman said to us all,
&ldquo;You will encounter hundreds of other races of sentient and
tool-using, if not always intelligent, beings if you cross the Pleroma
to places beyond the Tell. None of them are gods. You will have to war
with some if you want to survive. Some may have to die out. Some will
want to destroy you. Some you may wish to destroy or conquer. You will
have to look inside yourselves and to your poetry when those choices
are faced.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Agla&eacute; said, &ldquo;So there are no gods out
there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None out there,&rdquo; said the dragoman.
&ldquo;Perhaps one or more in here.&rdquo; He disappeared and
we all leaped back as the air rushing into the space where he had been
made a small thunderclap.</p>

<p>The <em>Muse&rsquo;s</em> sudden voice from
the walls made us all jump again.</p>

<p><em>Were all stars to disappear or die,</em></p>

<p><em>I should learn to look at an empty sky</em></p>

<p><em>And feel its total dark sublime,</em></p>

<p><em>Though this might take me a little time.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Which of the Bard&rsquo;s plays is that
from?&rdquo; asked Burbank, his voice hoarse with exhaustion and
disbelief that there were lines he did not know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Shakespeare,&rdquo; replied
the <em>Muse</em> in her new, young voice so filled with
dark energy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s by a man named Wystan Hugh
Auden. You people need to learn some new poets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll have time to teach
us,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Where are we now, please?&rdquo;
The viewstrips showed only stars, darkness, and arcane coordinates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re approaching pleromic transit-phase
velocity,&rdquo; said the <em>Muse.</em>
&ldquo;What is your desired destination?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only Agla&eacute; spoke, but she spoke for all of us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Home.&rdquo;</p>
