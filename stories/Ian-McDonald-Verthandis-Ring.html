<p>In the brilliant story that follows, one with enough dazzling
idea content crammed densely into it to fuel many another
author&rsquo;s eight-hundred-page novel, he shows us that total war
between competing interstellar races will be slow and bloody and vast,
and, well&mdash;<em>total.</em> With no room left in
the galaxy&mdash;or even the universe&mdash;for the losing side.</p>

<p>After thirteen subjective minutes and five hundred and
twenty-eight years, the Clade battleship <em>Ever-Fragrant
Perfume of Divinity</em> returned to the dying solar system. The
Oort cloud web pulled the crew off; skating around the gravity wells of
hot fat gas giants and the swelling primary, the battleship skipped out
of the system at thirty percent light-speed into the deep dark. Small,
fast, cheap, the battleships were disposable: a football of
construc&shy;tion nanoprocessors and a pload crew of three embedded
in the heart of a comet, a comet it would slowly consume over its half
millennium of flight. So cheap and nasty was this ship that it was only
given a name because the crew got bored five (subjective) minutes into
the slow-time simulation of Sofreendi desert monasticism that was their
preferred combat interface.</p>

<p>The Oort cloud web caught the crew, shied them to the
construction yards skeined through the long, cold loops of the cometary
halo, which flicked them in a stutter of light-speed to the Fat Gas
Giant relay point, where the eight hundred habitats of the new Clade
daughter fleet formed a pearl belly chain around the planet; then to
the Cladal Heart-world her&shy;self, basking in the coronal
energies of the senile, grasping, swollen sun, and finally into fresh
new selves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi guys, we&rsquo;re back,&rdquo; said the
crew of <em>Ever-Fragrant Perfume</em> as they stepped
from the bronze gates of the Soulhouse, down the marble staircase into
the thronged Maidan of All Luminous Passion. Irony was still a tradable
commodity on this innermost tier of the hundred concentric spheres of
the Heart-world, even if not one woman or man or machine or beastli
turned its head. Battleship crews knew better than to expect laurels
and accolades when they resouled after a hundred or a thousand or ten
thousand years on the frontline. Word of <em>Ever-Fragrant
Perfume&rsquo;s</em> victory had arrived almost three
centuries before. A signal victory; a triumph that would be studied and
taught across the Military Colleges and Academies of the Art of Defense
for millennia to come. A classic Rose of Jericho strategy.</p>

<p>Early warning seeds sown like thistledown across half a
light-millennium had felt the stroke of the Enemy across their
attenuated slow senses and woke. Communication masers hastily assembled
from the regoliths of cold moons beamed analyses back to the
Heart-world, deep in its centuries-long task of biosphere salvation:
eighty thousand habitats on the move. The Clade battle fleet launched
instantly. After two hundred and twenty years, there was not a
nanosecond to lose. Thirty-five ships were lost: systems
mal&shy;functions, breakdowns in the drives that kept them
accelerating eternally, decades-long subtle errors of navigation that
left them veering light-years wide of the target gravity well, loss of
deceleration mass. Sudden total cata&shy;strophic failure. Five
hundred years later, <em>Ever-Fragrant Perfume of Divinity</em>
alone arrived behind the third moon of the vagrant gas giant, which
wan&shy;dered between stars, a gravitational exile, and began to
construct the rain of antimatter warheads and set them into orbit
around the wanderer. A quick plan, but a brilliant one. A Rose of
Jericho plan. As <em>Ever-Fragrant Perfume of Divinity</em>
accelerated away from the bright new nebula, its hindward
sen&shy;sors observed eighty thousand Enemy worlds plow into the
bow wave of accelerated gas at forty percent light-speed and evaporate.
Twenty trillion sentients died. War in space-time is slow and vast and
bloody. When the spe&shy;cies fight, there is no mercy.</p>

<p>In the dying echoes of the culture fleet, the three assassins
of <em>Ever-Fragrant Perfume of Divinity</em> caught a
vector. The fleet had not been aimed on a genocidal assault on the
Clade Heart-worlds clustered around the worlds of Seydatryah, slowly
becoming postbiological as the sun choked and bloated on its own gas. A
vector, and a whisper: <em>Verthandi&rsquo;s Ring.</em></p>

<p>But now they were back, huzzah! Harvest Moon and Scented
Coolabar and Rose of Jericho, greatest tactician of her flesh
generation. Except that when they turned around on the steps of the
Soulhouse to bicker among themselves (as they had bickered the entire
time-slowed twenty-six minutes of the transtellar flight, and the
time-accelerated two hundred years of the mission at the black
wanderer) about where to go and do and be and funk first:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Rose? Where&rsquo;s the
Rose?&rdquo; said Harvest Moon, whose rank approximated most
closely to the historical role of Captain.</p>

<p>Only two resouls stood on the marble steps overlooking the
Maidan of All Luminous Pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; said Scented Coolabar, whose
station corresponded to that of engineer. A soul-search returned no
trace of their crewmate on this level. In this innermost level, the
heart of the heart, a sphere of quantum nano-processors ten kilometers
in diameter, such a search was far-reaching&mdash;the equivalent of
every virtual mouse hole and house shrine&mdash;and
instanta&shy;neous. And blank. The two remaining crew members of <em>Ever-Fragrant
Per&shy;fume of Divinity</em> understood too well what that
meant. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have to do the
meat-thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>Newly incarnated, Harvest Moon and Scented Coolabar stood upon
the Heaven Plain of Hoy. Clouds black as regret bruised the upcurved
horizon. Lightning fretted along the edge of the world. Harvest Moon
shivered at a fresh sensation; stringent but not
unpleasant&mdash;not in that brief frisson, though her new meat
told her that in excess it might become not just pain&shy;ful, but
dangerous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; she commented, observing
the small pimples rising on her space-black skin. She wore a
close-to-species-modal body: female in this incarnation; elegant,
hairless, attenuated, the flesh of a minimalist aesthete.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it was the wind,&rdquo; said Scented
Coolabar who, as ever, played against her Captain&rsquo;s type and
so wore the fresh flesh of a Dukkhim, one of the distinctive humanesque
subspecies that had risen after a mass-extinction event on the world of
Kethrem, near-lost in the strata of Clade history. She was small and
broad, all ovals and slits, and possessed of a great mane of
elaborately decorated hair that grew to the small of the back and down
to the elbows. The crew of the <em>Ever-Fragrant Perfume of
Divinity</em> was incarnate mere minutes, and already Harvest
Moon wanted to play play play with her engineer&rsquo;s wonderful
mane. &ldquo;Maybe you should have put some clothes on.&rdquo;
Now thunder spilled down the tilted bowl of the world to shake the
small stone stupa of the incarnaculum. &ldquo;I suppose we had
better get started.&rdquo; The Dukkhim had ever been a dour,
pragmatic subspecies.</p>

<p>Harvest Moon and Scented Coolabar spent the night in a
live-skin yurt blistered from the earth of Hoy. The thunder cracked,
the yurt flapped and boomed in the wind, and the plain of Hoy lowed
with storm-spooked grazebeastlis, but none so loud or so persistent as
Harvest Moon&rsquo;s moans and groans that her long black limbs
were aching, burning; her body was dying dying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some muscular pain is to be expected in the first
hours of incarnation,&rdquo; chided the yurt gently. &ldquo;As
muscle tone develops these pains generally pass within a few
days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Days!&rdquo; wailed Harvest Moon.
&ldquo;Tload me back up right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can secrete general analgesia,&rdquo; said
the tent. So until the lights came up all across the world on the sky
roof ten kilometers overhead, Harvest Moon suckled sweetly on pain-numb
milk from the yurt&rsquo;s fleshy teat, and, in the morning, she
and Scented Coolabar set out in great, low-gravity bounds across the
Heaven Plain of Hoy in search of Rose of Jericho. This
inner&shy;most of the Heart-world meat levels had long been the
preserve of ascetics and pilgrim souls; the ever upcurving plain
symbolic, perhaps, of the soul&rsquo;s quest for its innate
spiritual manifestation, or maybe because of its proxim&shy;ity to
the virtual realms, above the sky roof, where the ploads constructed
universe within universe, each bigger than the one that contained it.
Yet this small grassy sphere was big enough to contain tens of
thousands of Pelerines and stylites, coenobites and saddhus, adrift in
the ocean of grass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ve been this way
before,&rdquo; Scented Coolabar said. They were in the third monad
of their quest. Eighty days ago, Harvest Moon had discovered beyond the
pain of exercise the joy of muscles, even on this low-grav prairie, and
could now be found at every unassigned moment delightedly studying her
own matte black curves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s the idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bloody Rose of Jericho,&rdquo; Scented Coolabar
grumbled. They loped, three meters at a loose-limbed step, toward a
dendro-eremite, a lone small tree in the wave-swept grass, bare
branches upheld like prayers. &ldquo;Even on the ship she was a
damn ornery creature. Typical bloody selfish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Because when Rose of Jericho went missing after the routine
postsortie debrief, something else had gone missing with her.
Verthandi&rsquo;s Ring, a name, a galactic coordinate; the vector
upon which the Enemy migration had been accelerating, decade upon
decade. In the enforced communality of the return
flight&mdash;pload personalities intersecting and
merging&mdash;Cap&shy;tain and Engineer alike had understood
that their Mistress at Arms had deduced more than just a destination
from the glowing ashes of the annihi&shy;lated fleet. Soul
etiquette forbade nonconsensual infringements of privacy and Rose of
Jericho had used that social hiatus to conceal her speculations.
Jealous monotheistic divinities were not so zealous as Clade
debriefings, yet the Gentle Inquisitors of the Chamber of Ever-Renewing
Waters had swept around that hidden place like sea around a reef. A
vector, and a name, confirmation of the message they had received three
hundred years before: Verthandi&rsquo;s Ring.</p>

<p>Even before they saw the face framed in the vulva of living
wood, Har&shy;vest Moon and Scented Coolabar knew that their small
quest was ended. When they first met on the virtual desert of Sofreendi
for the Chamber of Ever-Renewing Waters&rsquo; mission briefing (as
dense and soul-piercing as its debrief), a closeness, a simpatico,
suggested that they might once have been the same person; ploads copied
and recopied and edited with mash-ups of other personalities. Empathy
endures, across parsecs and plain, battlefronts and secrets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does that hurt?&rdquo; Scented Coolabar said.
Greenwood crept down Rose of Jericho&rsquo;s brow, across her
cheeks and chin, slow and certain as seasons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurt? Why should it hurt?&rdquo; Wind soughed
in Rose of Jericho&rsquo;s twigs. Harvest Moon, bored with this
small world of grass, surreptitiously ran her hands down her muscled
thighs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, it just looks, well,
uncomfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s very very satisfying,&rdquo;
Rose of Jericho said. Her face was now a pinched oval of greening
flesh. &ldquo;Rooted. Slow.&rdquo; She closed her eyes in
contemplation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Verthandi&rsquo;s Ring,&rdquo; Harvest Moon
said suddenly. Scented Coolabar seated herself squatly on the grass
beneath the wise tree. Beastli things squirmed beneath her ass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this game?&rdquo; With life spans
measurable against the slow drift of stars, millennia-long games were
the weft of Clade society. &ldquo;What didn&rsquo;t you tell
them, couldn&rsquo;t you tell us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rose of Jericho opened her eyes. The wood now joined across
the bridge of her nose, her lips struggled against the lignum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was not one fleet. There are many fleets.
Some set off thousands of years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many fleets?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rose of Jericho struggled to speak. Scented Coolabar leaned
close.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of them. The Enemy. All of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Rose of Jericho&rsquo;s sparse leaves rustled and
Scented Coolabar felt the ground shake beneath her. Unbalanced, Harvest
Moon seized one of Rose of Jericho&rsquo;s branches to steady
herself. Not in ten reconfigurings had either of them felt such a
thing, but the knowledge was deeply burned into every memory, every
cell of their incarnated flesh. The Clade Heart-world had engaged its
Mach drive and was slowly, slow as a kiss, as an Edda, manipulating the
weave of space-time to accelerate away from bloated, burning
Seydatryah. Those unharvested must perish with the planet as the
Seydatryah&rsquo;s family of worlds passed beyond the age of
biology. Calls flick&shy;ered at light-speed across the system.
Strung like pearls around the gas giant, the eight hundred
half-gestated daughter-habitats left their birthing orbits:
half-shells, hollow environment spheres; minor Heart-worlds of a
handful of tiers. A quarter of the distance to the next star, the
manufactories and system defenses out in the deep blue cold of the Oort
cloud warped orbits to fall into the Heart-world&rsquo;s train. The
Chamber of Ever-Renewing Waters, the military council, together with
the Deep Blue Something, the gestalt &uuml;bermind that was the
Heart-world&rsquo;s participatory democracy, had acted the moment
it became aware of Rose of Jericho&rsquo;s small secret. The
Seyda&shy;tryah system glowed with message masers as the call went
out down the decades and centuries to neighboring Heart-worlds and
culture clouds and even meat planets: after one hundred thousand years,
we have an opportu&shy;nity to finally defeat the Enemy. Assemble
your antimatter torpedoes, your planet killers, your sun-guns and
quantum foam destabilizers, and make all haste for
Verthandi&rsquo;s Ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but what is Verthandi&rsquo;s
Ring?&rdquo; Scented Coolabar asked tetchily. But all that remained
of Rose of Jericho was a lignified smile, cast forever in bark. From
the tiny vacuum in her heart, like a tongue passing over a lost, loved
tooth, she knew that Rose of Jericho had fled moments before the
Chamber of Ever-Renewing Waters&rsquo; interrogation system slapped
her with an unbreakable subpoena and sucked her secret from her.
Scented Coolabar sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again?&rdquo; Harvest Moon asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>In all the known universe, there was only the Clade. All life
was part of it, it was all life. Ten million years ago, it had been
confined to a single species on a single world&mdash;a world not
forgotten, for nothing was forgotten by the Clade. That world, that
system, had long since been transformed into a sphere of Heart-world
orbiting a sun-halo of computational entities, but it still remembered
when the bright blue eye of its home planet blinked once, twice, ten
thousand times. Ships. Ships! Probe ships, sail ships, fast ships, slow
ships, seed ships, ice ships; whole asteroid colonies, hollow-head
comets, sent out on centuries-long falls toward other stars, other
worlds. Then, after the Third Evolution, pload ships, tiny splinters of
quantum computation flicked into the dark. In the first hundred
thousand years of the Clade&rsquo;s his&shy;tory, a thousand
worlds were settled. In the next hundred thousand, a hun&shy;dred
times that. And a hundred and a hundred and a hundred; colony seeded
colony seeded colony, while the space dwellers, the Heart-world
habitats and virtual pload intelligences, filled up the spaces in
between which, heart and truth, were the vastly greater part of the
universe. Relativistic ramships fast-tracked past lumbering arc fleets;
robot seed ships furled their sunsails and sprayed biospheres with
life-juice; terraforming squadrons hacked dead moons and hell-planets
into nests for life and intelligence and civilization. And species,
already broken by the Second and Third Evolutions into space-dwellers
and ploads, shattered into culture dust. Subspecies, new species,
evo&shy;lutions, devolutions; the race formerly known as humanity
blossomed into the many-petaled chrysanthemum of the Clade; a society
on the Cosmo&shy;logical scale; freed from the deaths of suns and
worlds, immune, immortal, growing faster than it could communicate its
gathered self-knowledge back to its immensely ancient and powerful Type
4 civilizations; entire globular clusters turned to hiving, howling
quantum-nanoprocessors.</p>

<p>New species, subspecies, hybrid species. Life was profligate
in the cosmos; even multicellular life. The Clade incorporated DNA from
a hundred thou&shy;sand alien biospheres and grew in richness and
diversity. Intelligence alone was unique. In all its One Giant Leap,
the Clade had never encountered another bright with sentience and the
knowledge of its own mortality that was the key to civilization. The
Clade was utterly alone. And thus intel&shy;ligence became the
watchword and darling of the Clade: intelligence, that counterentropic
conjoined twin of information, must become the most powerful force in
the universe, the energy to which all other physical laws must
eventually kneel. Intelligence alone could defeat the heat-death of the
universe, the dark wolf at the long thin end of time. Intelligence was
destiny, manifest.</p>

<p>And then a Hujjain reconnaissance probe, no bigger than the
thorn of a rose but vastly more sharp, cruising the edge of a dull
little red dwarf, found a million habitats pulled in around the stellar
embers. When the Palaelogos of the Byzantine Orthodoxy first
encountered the armies of Islam crashing out of the south, he had
imagined them just another heretical Christian sect. So had the Hujjain
probe doubted; then, as it searched its memory, the entire history of
the Clade folded into 11-space, came revelation. There was Another out
there.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>In the six months it took the Seydatryah fleet&mdash;one
Heart-world, eighty semi-operational habitats, two hundred twelve
thousand ancillary craft and defensive systems&mdash;to accelerate
to close enough to light-speed for time-dilation effects to become
significant, Harvest Moon and Scented Coolabar searched the Tier of
Anchyses. The world-elevator, which ran from the por&shy;tals of
the Virtual Realms through which nothing corporeal might pass to the
very lowest, heavy-gee Tier of Pterimonde, a vast and boundless ocean,
took the star-sailors forty kilometers and four tiers down to the
SkyPort of Anchyses, an inverted city that hung like a chandelier, a
sea urchin, a crystal geode, from the sky roof. Blimps and zeps,
balloon clusters and soaring glid&shy;ers fastened on the ornate
tower bottoms to load, and fuel, and feed, and receive passengers. Ten
kilometers below, beyond cirrus and nimbus, the dread forest of Kyce
thrashed and twined, a venomous, vicious, hooked-and-clawed ecosystem
that had evolved over the Heart-world&rsquo;s million-year history
around the fallen bodies of sky dwellers.</p>

<p>The waxing light of tier-dawn found Scented Coolabar on the
observa&shy;tion deck of the dirigible <em>We Have Left
Undone That Which We Ought to Have Done.</em> The band of
transparent skin ran the entire equator of the kilometer-long creature:
in her six months as part of the creature&rsquo;s higher-cognitive
function, Scented Coolabar had evolved small tics and habits, one of
which was watching the birth of a new day from the very forward point
of the dirigible. The Morning Salutationists were rolling up their
sutra mats as Scented Coolabar took her place by the window and
imagined her body cloaked in sky. She had changed body for this level;
a tall, slightly hirsute male with a yellow-tinged skin, but she had
balked at taking the same tran&shy;sition as Harvest Moon. Even
now, she looped and tumbled out there in the pink and lilac morning, in
aerobatic ecstasy with her flockmates among the indigo clouds.</p>

<p>Dawn light gleamed from silver wing feathers. Pain and want
and, yes, jealousy clutched Scented Coolabar. Harvest Moon had been the
one who bitched and carped about the muscle pain and the sunburn and
the indi&shy;gestion and the necessity to clean one&rsquo;s
teeth; the duties and fallibilities of incarnation. Yet she had fallen
in love with corporeality; reveled in the physicality of wind in her
pinions, gravity tugging at the shapely curve of her ass; while Scented
Coolabar remained solid, stolid, reluctant flesh. She could no longer
remember the last time they had had sex; physically or virtually.
Games. And war was just another game to entities hundreds of thousands
of years old, for whom death was a sleep and a forgetting, and a
morn&shy;ing like this, fresh and filled with light. She remembered
the actions they had fought: the reduction of Yorrrt, the defense of
Thau-Pek-Sat, where Rose of Jericho had annihilated an Enemy
strike-fleet with a blizzard of micro-black holes summoned out of the
universal quantum foam, explod&shy;ing almost instantly in a
holocaust of Hawking radiation. She watched Har&shy;vest
Moon&rsquo;s glider-thin wings deep down in the brightening clouds,
thin as dreams and want. Sex was quick; sex was easy, even sacramental,
among the many peoples and sects that temporarily formed the
consciousness of <em>We Have Left Undone That Which We Ought to
Have Done.</em> She sighed and felt the breath shudder in her
flat, muscled chest. Startled by a reaction as sen&shy;sational, as
physical, as any Immelman or slow loop performed by Harvest Moon,
Scented Coolabar felt tears fill and roll. Memory, a frail and
trick&shy;ster faculty among the incarnate, took her back to
another body, a wom&shy;an&rsquo;s body, a woman of the
Teleshgathu nation; drawn in wonder and hope and young excitement up
the space elevator to the Clade habitat that had warped into orbit
around her world to repair and restore and reconstitute its radiation
shield from the endless oceans of her world. From that woman of a
parochial Waterworld had sprung three entities, closer than sisters,
deeper than lovers. Small wonder they needed each other, to the point
of searching through eighty billion sentients. Small wonder they could
never escape each other. The light was bright now, its unvarying shadow
strict and stark on the wooden deck. Harvest Moon flashed her wings and
rolled away, diving with her new friends deep through layer upon layer
of cloud. And Scented Coolabar felt an unfamiliar twitch, a clench
between the legs, a throb of something already exposed and sensitive
becoming superattuned, swinging like a diviner&rsquo;s pendulum.
Her balls told her, clear, straight, no arguments: she&rsquo;s out
there. Rose of Jericho.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>Twenty subjective minutes later, the Clade fleet was eighty
light-years into its twelve hundred objective-year flight to intercept
the Enemy advance toward Verthandi&rsquo;s Ring, the greatest
sentient migration since the big bang. Populations numbered in
logarithmic notation, like outbreaks of viruses, are on the move in two
hundred million habitat-ships, each fifty times the diameter of the
Seydatryah Heart-world. Of course the Seydatryah cluster is
outnumbered, of course it will be destroyed down to the last molecule
if it engages the Enemy migration, but the Deep Blue Something
understands that it may not be the biggest or the strongest, but it is
the closest and will be the first. So the culture cluster claws closer
toward light-speed; its magnetic shield furled around it like an
aurora, like a cloak of fire, as it absorbs energies that would
instantly incinerate all carbon life in its many levels and ships. And,
nerve-wired into an organic ornithopter, Scented Coolabar drops free
from the <em>We Have Left Undone That Which We Ought to Have
Dones</em> launch teats into eighty kilometers of empty airspace.
Scented Coolabar shrieks, then the ornithopter&rsquo;s wings scrape
and cup and the scream becomes <em>oooh</em> as the
biological machine scoops across the sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where away?&rdquo; Scented Coolabar shouts. The
ornithopter unfolds a telescope, bending an eye; Scented Coolabar spies
the balloon cluster low and breaking from a clot of cumulus. A full
third of the netted balloons are dead, punctured, black and rotting.
The ornithopter reads her intention and dives. A flash of sun-silver:
Harvest Moon rises vertically out of the cloud, hangs in the air,
impossibly elongated wings catching the morning light, then turns and
tumbles to loop over Scented Coolabar&rsquo;s manically beating
wings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s her.&rdquo; <em>You are
very lovely,</em> thought Scented Coolabar. <em>Lovely and
alien.</em> But not so alien as Rose of Jericho, incarnated as a
colony of tentacled balloons tethered in a veil of organic gauze, now
terminally sagging toward the claspers and bone blades of Kyce. The
ornithopter matched speed; wind whipped Scented Coolabar&rsquo;s
long yellow hair. A lunge, a sense of the world dropping away, or at
least her belly, and then the ornithopter&rsquo;s claws were hooked
into the mesh. The stench of rotting balloon flesh assailed Scented
Coolabar&rsquo;s senses. A soft pop, a rush of reeking gas, a
terrifying drop closer to the fanged mouths of the forest: another
balloon had failed. Harvest Moon, incarnated without feet or wheels,
for her species was never intended to touch the ground, turned lazy
circles in the sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same again?&rdquo; Scented Coolabar asked. Rose
of Jericho spoke through radio-sense into her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Foolish of Scented Coolabar to imagine a Rose of Jericho game
being ended so simply or so soon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Deep Blue Something has worked it
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should hope so.&rdquo; The balloon cluster
was failing, sinking fast. With the unaided eye Scented Coolabar could
see the lash-worms and bladed dashers racing along the sucker-studded
tentacles of the forest canopy. This round of the game was almost
ended. She hoped her ornithopter was smart enough to realize the
imminent danger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Verthandi&rsquo;s Ring?&rdquo; Harvest
Moon asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is a remnant superstring.&rdquo; A subquantal
fragment of the original big-bang fireball, caught by cosmic inflation
and stretched to macroscopic, then to Cosmological scale. Rarer than
virtue or phoenixes, remnant superstrings haunted the galactic fringes
and the vast spaces between star spirals; tens, hundreds of light-years
long. In all the Clade&rsquo;s memory, only one had ever been
recorded within the body of the galaxy. Until now. &ldquo;Tied into
a loop,&rdquo; Rose of Jericho added. Scented Coolabar and Harvest
Moon understood at once. Only the hand of the Enemy&mdash;if the
Enemy possessed such things, no communication had ever been made with
them, no physical trace ever found from the wreckage of their ships or
their vaporized colony clus&shy;ters&mdash;could have attained
such a thing. And that was why the Chamber of Ever-Renewing Waters had
launched the Heart-world. Such a thing could only be an ultimate weapon.</p>

<p><em>But what does it do?</em> Scented Coolabar and
Harvest Moon asked at once, but the presence in their brains, one
humanesque, one man-bat-glider, was gone. Game over. A new round
beginning. With a shriek of alarm, the or&shy;nithopter cast free
just in time to avoid the tendrils creeping up over the canopies of the
few surviving balloons. The tentacles of the forest clasped those of
the balloon cluster and hauled it down. Then the blades came out.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>How do wars begin? Through affront, through bravado, through
stupidity or overconfidence, through sacred purpose or greed. But when
galactic cultures fight, it is out of inevitability, out of a sense of
cosmic tragedy. It is through understanding of a simple evolutionary
truth: there can be only one exploiter of an ecological niche, even if
that niche is the size of a universe. Within milliseconds of receiving
the inquisitive touch of the Hujjain probe, the Enemy realized this
truth. The vaporizing of the probe was the declaration of war, and
would have given the Enemy centuries of a head start had not the
Hujjain craft in its final milliseconds squirted off a burst of
communication to its mother array deep in the cometary system on the
edge of interstellar space.</p>

<p>In the opening centuries of the long, slow war, the
Clade&rsquo;s expansion was checked and turned back. Trillions
died. Planets were cindered; populations sterilized beneath a burning
ultraviolet sky, their ozone layers and protective magnetic fields
stripped away; habitat clusters incinerated by induced solar flares or
reduced to slag by nanoprocessor plagues; Dyson spheres shattered by
billions of antimatter warheads. The Clade was slow to realize what the
Enemy understood from the start: that a war for the resources that
intelli&shy;gence required&mdash;energy, mass,
gravity&mdash;must be a war of extermination. In the first two
thousand years of the war, the Clade&rsquo;s losses equaled the
total biomass of its original prestarflight solar system. But its
fecundity, the sheer irrepressibility of life, was the
Clade&rsquo;s strength. It fought back. Across centu&shy;ries
it fought; across distances so vast the light of victory or defeat
would be pale, distant winks in the night sky of far future
generations. In the hearts of globular clusters they fought, and the
radiant capes of nebulae; through the looping fire bridges on the skins
of suns and along the event horizons of black holes. Their weapons were
gas giants and the energies of supernovae; they turned asteroid belts
into shotguns and casually flung living planets into the eternal ice of
interstellar space. Fleets ten thousand a side clashed between suns,
leaving not a single survivor. It was war absolute, elemental. Across a
million star systems, the Clade fought the Enemy to a standstill. And,
in the last eight hundred years, began to drive them back.</p>

<p>Now, time dilated to the point where a decade passed in a
single heart&shy;beat, total mass close to that of a thousand
stars, the Clade Heart-world Seydatryah and its attendant culture
cluster plunged at a prayer beneath light-speed toward the closed
cosmic string loop of Verthandi&rsquo;s Ring. She flew blind; no
information, no report could outrun her. Her half trillion sentients
would arrive with only six months forewarning into what might be the
final victory, or the Enemy&rsquo;s final stand.</p>

<p>Through the crystal shell of the Heart-world, they watched the
Clade attack fleet explode like thistledown against the glowing nebula
of the Enemy migration. Months ago those battleships had died,
streaking ahead of the decelerating Seydatryah civilization to engage
the Enemy pickets and, by dint of daring and force of fortune, perhaps
break through to attack a habitat cluster. The greater mass of the
Clade, dropping down the blue shift as over the years and decades they
fell in behind Seydatryah, confirmed the astonished reports of those
swift, bold fighters. All the Enemy was here; a caravanserai hundreds
of light-years long. Ships, worlds, had been under way for centuries
before <em>Ever-Fragrant Perfume of Divinity</em> located
and destroyed one of the pilgrim fleets. The order must have been given
millennia before; shortly after the Clade turned the tide of battle in
its favor. Retreat. Run away. But the Enemy had lost none of its
strength and savagery as wave after wave of the cheap, fast, sly
battle&shy;ships were annihilated.</p>

<p>Scented Coolabar and Harvest Moon and Rose of Jericho huddled
to&shy;gether in the deep dark and crushing pressure of the ocean
at the bottom of the world. They wore the form of squid; many-tentacled
and big-eyed, com&shy;municating by coded ripples of bioluminescent
frills along their streamlined flanks. They did not doubt that they had
watched themselves die time after time out there. It was likely that
only they had died, a million deaths. The Chamber of Ever-Renewing
Waters would never permit its ace battleship crew to desert into the
deep, starlit depths of Pterimonde. Their ploads had doubtless been
copied a million times into the swarm of fast attack ships. The
erstwhile crew of the <em>Ever-Fragrant Perfume of Divinity</em>
blinked their huge golden eyes. Over the decades and centuries, the
light of the Enemy&rsquo;s retreat would be visible over the entire
galaxy, a new and gorgeous ribbon nebula. Now, a handful of
light-months from the long march, the shine of hypervelocity particles
impacting the deflection fields was a banner in the sky, a starbow
across an entire quadrant. And ahead, Verthandi&rsquo;s Ring, a
star&shy;less void three light-years in diameter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won them enough time,&rdquo; Scented
Coolabar said in a flicker of blue and green. The game was over. It
ended at the lowest place in the world, but it had been won years
before, she realized. It had been won the moment Rose of Jericho
diverted herself away from the Soulhouse into a meditation tree on the
Holy Plains of Hoy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe so,&rdquo; Rose of Jericho said,
hovering a kiss away from the crystal wall, holding herself against the
insane Coriolis storms that stirred this high-gravity domain of waters.
&ldquo;It will be centuries before the Clade arrives in
force.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Chamber of Ever-Renewing Waters could regard it
as treachery,&rdquo; Harvest Moon said. Rose of Jericho touched the
transparency with a tentacle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I not serve them with heart and mind and
life?&rdquo; The soft fireworks were fewer now; one by one they
faded to nothing. &ldquo;And anyway, what would they charge me
with? Handing the Clade the universe on a plate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or condemning the Clade to death,&rdquo; said
Scented Coolabar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not our Clade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had been brilliant, Scented Coolabar realized. To have
worked it out in those few minutes of subjective flight, and known what
to do to save the Clade. But she had always been the greatest strategic
mind of her genera&shy;tion. Not for the first time Scented
Coolabar wondered about their lost forebear, that extraordinary female
who had birthed them from her ploaded intellect.</p>

<p>What is Verthandi&rsquo;s Ring? A closed cosmic string.
And what is a closed cosmic string? A time machine. A portal to the
past. But not the past of <em>this</em> universe. Any
transit of a closed timelike loop led inevitably to a parallel
universe. In that time-stream, there too was war; Clade and Enemy,
locked in Darwinian combat. And in that universe, as the Enemy was
driven back to gaze into annihilation, Verthandi&rsquo;s Ring
opened and a second Enemy, a duplicate Enemy in every way, came out of
the sky. They had handed the Clade this universe; the prize for driving
its parallel in the <em>alternate</em> time-stream to
extinction.</p>

<p>Cold-blooded beneath millions of tons of deep cold pressure,
Scented Coolabar shivered. Rose of Jericho had assessed the tactical
implications and made the only possible choice: delay the Chamber of
Ever-Renewing Waters and the Deep Blue Something so they could not
prevent the Enemy exiting this universe. A bloodless win. An end to
war. Intelligence the savior of the blind, physical universe. While in
the second time-stream, Clade habitats burst like crushed eyeballs and
worlds were scorched bare and the Enemy found its resources suddenly
doubled.</p>

<p>Scented Coolabar doubted that she could ever make such a deal.
But she was an Engineer, not a Mistress of Arms. Her tentacles caressed
Rose of Jericho&rsquo;s lobed claspers; a warm sexual thrill pulsed
through her muscular body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay with us, stay with me,&rdquo; Harvest Moon
said. Her decision was made, the reluctant incarnation; she had fallen
in love with the flesh and would remain exploring the
Heart-world&rsquo;s concentric tiers in thousands of fresh and
exciting bodies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I have to go.&rdquo; Rose of Jericho
briefly brushed Harvest Moon&rsquo;s sexual tentacles.
&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t hurt me. They knew I had no choice, as
they had no choice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scented Coolabar turned in the water. Her fins rippled,
propelling her upward through the pitch-black water. Rose of Jericho
fell in behind her. In a few strong strokes, the lights of Harvest
Moon&rsquo;s farewell faded, even the red warmth of her love, and
all that remained was the centuries-deep shine of the starbow beyond
the wall of the world.</p>

<p>obert Reed sold his first story in 1986, and quickly
established himself as a frequent contributor to <em>The
Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction</em> and <em>Asimov&rsquo;s
Science Fiction,</em> as well as selling many stories to <em>Science
Fiction Age, Universe, New Destinies, Tomorrow, Synergy, Starlight,</em>
and elsewhere. Reed may be one of the most prolific of
today&rsquo;s young writers, particularly at short fiction lengths,
seriously rivaled for that position only by authors such as Stephen
Baxter and Brian Stableford. And&mdash;also like Baxter and
Stable&shy;ford&mdash;he manages to keep up a very high
standard of quality <em>while</em> being prolific,
something that is not at all easy to do. Reed stories such as
&ldquo;Sister Alice,&rdquo; &ldquo;Brother
Perfect,&rdquo; &ldquo;Decency,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Savior,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Remoras,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Chrysalis,&rdquo; &ldquo;Whiptail,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Utility Man,&rdquo; &ldquo;Marrow,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Birth Day,&rdquo; &ldquo;Blind,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Toad of Heaven,&rdquo; &ldquo;Stride,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Shape of Every thing,&rdquo; &ldquo;Guest of
Honor,&rdquo; &ldquo;Wag&shy;ing Good,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Killing the Morrow,&rdquo; among at least a half-dozen
others equally as strong, count as some of the best short work produced
by anyone in the eighties and nineties; many of his best stories were
assembled in his first collection, <em>The Dragons of
Springplace.</em> Nor is he nonprolific as a novel&shy;ist,
having turned out eight novels since the end of the eighties, including
<em>The Lee Shore, The Hormone Jungle, Black Milk, The
Remarkables, Down the Bright Way, Beyond the Veil of Stars, An
Exaltation of Larks, Beneath the Gated Sky, Marrow,</em> and <em>Sister
Alice.</em> His most recent books are a chapbook novella, <em>Mere,</em>
a new collection, <em>The Cuckoo&rsquo;s Boys,</em>
and a new novel, <em>The Well of Stars.</em> Coming up is
a new novella chapbook, <em>Flavors of My Genius.</em>
Reed lives with his family in Lincoln, Nebraska.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Sister Alice&rdquo; stories, in which
advanced humans with the powers and abilities of gods played out
intricate political intrigues and struggles across a time span of
millions of years, eventually collected in the mosaic novel <em>Sister
Alice,</em> were Reed&rsquo;s first great contribution to the
New Space Opera. In 1994, he launched a long series of stories, still
continuing today, about the Great Ship: a Jupiter-sized starship found
abandoned in deep space by exploring humans and retrofitted into a kind
of immense interstel&shy;lar cruise ship, off on a grand tour of
the galaxy (circumnavigating it, in fact, a voyage that will take
eons), with dozens of human and alien customers of different races
aboard. In the powerful story that follows, which takes place after a
disastrous attempt to hijack the Great Ship has reduced it nearly to
ruins, he shows us what happens to some human survivors of the battle
who are stranded <em>outside</em> of the Ship, locked out
of the interior for generations, forced to create their own society on
the hull&mdash;a place that, as it turns out, is equipped with
quite a few wonders&mdash;and dangers&mdash;of its own.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>1</p>

<p>Yes, the galaxy possessed an ethereal beauty, particularly
when magnified inside the polished bowl of a perfect mirror. Every
raider conceded as much. And yes, the rocket nozzle on which they lived
was a spectacular feature, vast and ancient, its bowllike depths filled
with darkness and several flavors of ice laid over a plain of
impenetrable hyperfiber. Even the refugee city was lovely in its modest
fashion, simple homes and little businesses clinging to the inside
surface of the sleeping nozzle. But true raiders un&shy;derstood
that the most intriguing, soul-soaring view was found when you stood
where Peregrine was standing now: perched some five thousand
kilo&shy;meters above the hull, staring down at the
Polypond&mdash;a magnificent, ever-changing alien body that
stretched past the neighboring nozzles, reaching the far horizon and
beyond, submerging both faces of a magnificent starship that itself was
larger than worlds.</p>

<p>The Polypond had arrived thousands of years ago, descending as
a violent rain of comet-sized bodies, scalding vapor, and sentient,
hate-filled mud. The alien had wanted to destroy the Great Ship, and
perhaps even today it dreamed of nothing less. But most of the
city&rsquo;s inhabitants believed the war was over now, and in one
fashion or another, the Ship had won. Some were sure the alien had
surrendered unconditionally. Others believed that the
Polypond&rsquo;s single mind had collapsed, leaving a multitude of
factions end&shy;lessly fighting with one another. Both tales
explained quite a lot, including the monster&rsquo;s indifference
to a few million refugees living just beyond its boundaries. But the
most compelling idea&mdash;the notion that always
capti&shy;vated Peregrine&mdash;was that human beings had not
only won the war, but killed their foe too. Its central mind was
destroyed, all self-control had been vanquished, and what the young man
saw from his diamond blister was noth&shy;ing more, or less, than a
great corpse in the throes of ferocious, creative rot.</p>

<p>Whatever the truth, the Polypond was a spectacle, and no
raider under&shy;stood it better than Peregrine did.</p>

<p>Frigid wisps of atomic oxygen and nitrogen marked the aliens
upper reaches, with dust and buckyballs and aerogel trash wandering
free. That high atmosphere reached halfway to the hull, and it ended
with a sequence of transparent skins&mdash;monomolecular sheets,
mostly, plus a few energetic demon-doors laid out flat. Retaining gas
and heat was their apparent pur&shy;pose, and when those skins were
pierced, what lay below could feel the prick, and on occasion, react
instantly.</p>

<p>Beneath the skins was a thick wet atmosphere, not just warm
but hot&mdash;a fierce blazing wealth of changeable gases and smart
dusts, floating clouds and rooted clouds, plus features that refused
description by any language. And drenching that realm was a wealth of
light. The glare wasn&rsquo;t constant or evenly distributed. What
passed for day came as splashes and winding rivers, and the color of
the light as well as its intensity and duration would vary. After
spending most of his brief life watching the purples and crimsons,
emeralds and golds, plus a wealth of blues that stretched from the
brilliant to the soothing, Peregrine had realized that each color and
its intricate shape held meaning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A common belief,&rdquo; Hawking had told him.
&ldquo;But your translator AIs cannot find any message, or even the
taste of genuine language.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except I wasn&rsquo;t thinking
language,&rdquo; Peregrine countered. &ldquo;Not at
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His friend wanted more of an answer, signaling his desires
with silence and circular gestures from his most delicate arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I meant plain simple beauty,&rdquo; the young
man continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking about art, about visual
poetry. I&rsquo;m thinking about a magnificent show
per&shy;formed for a very special audience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might be the only soul holding that
opinion,&rdquo; Hawking counseled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I feel honored because of it,&rdquo;
Peregrine had laughed.</p>

<p>The Polypond&rsquo;s atmosphere was full of motion and
energy, and it was ex&shy;ceptionally loud. Camouflaged microphones
set near the base of the rocket nozzle sent home the constant roar of
wind sounds and mouth sounds, thunder from living clouds and the
musical whine of great wings. But even richer than the air was the
watery terrain beneath: tens of kilometers deep, the
Polypond&rsquo;s body was built from melted comets mixed with rock
and metal stolen from vanished worlds. This was an ocean in the same
sense that a human body was mere salt water. Yes, it was liquid, but
jammed full of structure and purpose. Alien tissues supplied muscles
and spines and ribs, and there were regions serving roles not unlike
those of human hearts and livers and lungs. Long, sophisticated
membranes were dotted with giant fusion reactors. And drifting on the
surface were island-sized organs that spat out free-living
entities&mdash;winged entities that would gather in huge flocks and
sometimes rise en masse, millions and even billions of them
soar&shy;ing higher than any cloud.</p>

<p>Hatches, those events were called.</p>

<p>What Peregrine knew&mdash;what every person in his trade
understood&mdash;was that each hatch was a unique event, and the
great majority were worthless. Sending a fleet of raiders that returned
with only a few thousand tons of winged muscle and odd
enzymes&hellip; well, that was a waste of their limited power, and
always a potential waste of lives. What mattered were those rare
hatches that rose high enough to be reached cheaply, and even then it
didn&rsquo;t pay to send raiders if there wasn&rsquo;t some
respectable chance of acquiring hyperfiber or rare elements, or best of
all, machines that could be harvested and tamed, then set to work in
whatever role the city demanded.</p>

<p>Judging a hatch&rsquo;s value was three parts diagnosis,
two parts art, and, inevi&shy;tably, ten parts good fortune.
Telescopes tied into dim-witted machines did nothing but happily stuff
data into shapes that brighter AIs could analyze. Whatever was
promising or peculiar was sent to the raider leaders. The average day
brought ten or fifteen events worthy of closer examination, and because
of his service record, Peregrine was given first glance at those
candidates. But even with ripe pickings, he often did nothing. Other
raiders flying their own ships would dive into the high atmosphere
every few days. But sometimes weeks passed without Peregrine once being
tempted to sit in the pilot&rsquo;s padded chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to grow old in this job,&rdquo; he
confessed whenever his bravery was questioned. &ldquo;Most souls
can&rsquo;t do what I do. Most of you are too brave, and bravery is
suicide. Fearlessness is a handicap. Chasing every million-wing flight
of catabolites or sky-spinners is the quickest way to go bankrupt, if
you&rsquo;re lucky. Or worse, die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a reasonable philosophy,&rdquo; his
friend mentioned, speaking through the voice box sewn into a convenient
neural center.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Peregrine replied.
&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t talking to you. I was chatting with a
woman friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The alien lifted one of his intricate limbs, signaling
puzzlement. &ldquo;And where is this woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inside my skull.&rdquo; Peregrine gave his
temple a few hard taps. &ldquo;I met her last night. I thought she
was pretty, and she was pleasant enough. But she said some critical
words about raiders wasting too many resources, and I thought she was
accusing me of being a coward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You listed your sensible reasons, of
course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not all of them,&rdquo; he admitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; said Peregrine. &ldquo;I
thought she was pretty. And if I acted like an unapologetic coward, I
wouldn&rsquo;t get invited to her bedroom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hawking absorbed this tidbit about human spawning. Or he
simply ig&shy;nored it. Who could know what that creature was
thinking beneath his thick carapace? Low-built and long, Hawking held a
passing resemblance to an earthly trilobite. A trio of crystalline eyes
pulled in light from all direc&shy;tions, delicate optical tissues
teasing the meaning out of every photon. His armored body was carried
on dozens of jointed legs. But where trilobites had three sections to
their insectlike bodies, this alien had five. And where trilobites were
dim-witted creatures haunting the floors of ancient seas,
Hawking&rsquo;s ancestors had evolved grasping limbs and large,
intricate minds while scurrying across the lush surface of a
low-gravity world.</p>

<p>Hawking was not a social animal. And this was a blessing,
since he was the only one of his kind in the city. Peregrine had
studied the available files about his species, but the local data sinks
were intended to help military op&shy;erations, not educate any
would-be xenologists. And likewise, after spending decades in close
association with the creature, and despite liking as well as admiring
him, Peregrine found there were moments when old Mr. Hawk&shy;ing
was nothing but peculiar, standoffish, and quite impossible to read.</p>

<p>But Peregrine had a taste for challenges.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; he said, cutting into the
silence. &ldquo;I lied to that woman. I told her that I
wasn&rsquo;t flying because I knew something big was coming. I had
a feeling, and until that ripe moment, I was resting both my body and
my ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she believed you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a brief silence, Hawking said, &ldquo;She sounds
like a foolish young creature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re
wrong.&rdquo; Peregrine laughed and shrugged. &ldquo;Just as I
hoped, I climbed into her bed. And during one of our slow moments, she
admitted who she was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An engineer during the War. She was working in the
repair yards while my mother was serving as a pilot. So like you, my
new girlfriend is one of the original founders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; his friend responded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fusillade is her name,&rdquo; he mentioned.
&ldquo;And she seems to know you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet I do not know her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Peregrine added, &ldquo;And by the way, she very
clearly remembers your arrival here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fourteen moon-sized rocket nozzles stood upon the Great
Ship&rsquo;s aft, and during the fighting, the center nozzle served
as the gathering place for tired pilots and engineers and such. Once
the fighting ended, representatives of twenty different species found
themselves trapped in this most unpromising location, utterly isolated,
with few working machines, minimal data sinks, and no raw materials.
Facing them was the daunting task of building some kind of workable
society. Hawking was a rarity&mdash;the rich passenger who had
visited the hull before the comets began to fall, and who managed to
outlive both his guides and fellow tourists. Alone, this solitary
creature had scaled one of the outlying nozzles, and then his luck
lasted long enough to find passage with a harum-scarum
unit&mdash;the final group of refugees to make it to this poor but
safe place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She feels sorry for you, Hawking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why would she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re a species with a
population of one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The alien was unimpressed with that assessment. He cut the air
with two limbs, his natural mouth rippling before leaking a
disapproving click.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know better than that,&rdquo; Peregrine
continued. &ldquo;I told her that you&rsquo;re a loner, that
it&rsquo;s difficult for you to share breathing space with me, and
you know me and approve of me far more than you know and approve of
anyone else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The creature had no reply.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Why call him Hawking?&rsquo; she
asked me. &lsquo;Nobody else does.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Few others speak to me,&rdquo; his friend said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I explained that too,&rdquo; said Peregrine.
&ldquo;And I told her that your species are so peculiar, you never
see reason for any permanent names. When two of you cross trails, each
invents a new name for himself or herself. A private name that lasts
only as long as that single perishable relationship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The limbs gave the air an agreeable sweep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You picked Hawking, and I don&rsquo;t know
why,&rdquo; Peregrine continued. &ldquo;Except it&rsquo;s a
solid sound humans can utter. Unlike your own species&rsquo; name,
of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quietly, with his natural mouth, Hawking made a sharp clicking
sound followed by what sounded like &ldquo;!Eech.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;!Eech,&rdquo; the human tried to repeat.</p>

<p>As always, there was something intensely humorous about his
clumsy attempt. Nothing changed in the creature&rsquo;s domelike
eyes or the rigid face, but suddenly all of the long legs wiggled
together, signaling laughter, the ripples moving happily beneath his
hard low unreadable body.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I remember your mother,&rdquo; the old
woman had mentioned last night.</p>

<p>Like that of every citizen, Fusillade&rsquo;s apartment
was tiny and cold; power had always been a scarce commodity in the
city. But her furnishings were better than most, made from fancy
plastics and cultured flesh, and even a glass tub filled with spare
water. Winking at her young lover, she added, &ldquo;No, I doubt if
your mother ever actually knew me. By name, I mean. But I was part of
the team that kept those early raider ships flying. Without twenty
ad-lib repairs from me, that woman wouldn&rsquo;t be half the hero
she is today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peregrine&rsquo;s mother was as famous as anyone in the
city, and that despite being dead for dozens of centuries. She had
defended these giant rockets during the Polypond War. But the alien
eventually destroyed each of the Great Ship&rsquo;s engines,
choking and plugging every vent, trying to keep rein&shy;forcements
from reaching the hull. And at the same time, the captains below had
blocked every doorway, desperate to keep the Polypond from
infiltrat&shy;ing the interior. Brutal fights were waged near the
main ports, but none had lasted long. A barrage of tiny black holes was
fired through the Ship&rsquo;s heart, but none delivered a killing
blow. Then the final assault came, and despite long odds, a starship
that was more ancient than any visible sun survived.</p>

<p>Afterward, over the course of several months and then several
years, the Polypond grew quieter, and by every credible measure, less
menacing.</p>

<p>Something was different. The alien was different, and maybe
the Great Ship too. But those few thousand survivors could never be
sure what had changed. With the clarity of the doomed, they had come
here and built a refugee camp. Peregrine&rsquo;s mother was a
natural leader. Like her son, she was a small person, dark as space,
blessed with long limbs and a gymnast&rsquo;s perfect balance. And
she was more than just an early raider. No, what made the woman special
was that she was first to realize that nobody was coming to rescue
them. The giant engines remained dead and blocked. High-grade
hyperfiber had plugged even the most obscure route through the armored
hull. And even worse, the Great Ship was now undergoing some mysterious
but undeniable acceleration. Without one working rocket, the
world-sized machine was gaining velocity, hurrying its way along a
course that would soon take it out of the Milky Way.</p>

<p>Peregrine&rsquo;s mother helped invent the
raider&rsquo;s trade. In makeshift vehicles, she dove into the
Polypond&rsquo;s atmosphere, stealing volatiles and rare earths,
plus the occasional machine-encrusted body. Those treasures allowed
them to build shelters and synthesize food. Every few days, she bravely
led an expedition into the monster&rsquo;s body, stealing what was
useful and accepting every danger.</p>

<p>Time and Fate ensured her death.</p>

<p>She left no body, save for a few useful pieces that made up
her meager estate. Her funeral was held ages ago, yet even today,
whenever an important anniversary arrived, those rites and her name
were repeated by thousands of thankful souls.</p>

<p>By contrast, Peregrine&rsquo;s father was neither heroic
nor well regarded. But he was a prosperous fellow, and he was shrewd,
and when one of the great woman&rsquo;s eggs came on the market, he
spent a fortune to obtain it and a second fortune to build the first
artificial womb in the city&rsquo;s history.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember your mother,&rdquo; the old woman
told Peregrine, plainly proud of any casual association. Then with an
important tone, she added, &ldquo;That good woman would have been
pleased with her young son. I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peregrine was almost three hundred years old, which made him
young&mdash; particularly in the eyes of a much older lady who
seemed to be happily feeding a fantasy. He offered nods and a polite
smile, saying, &ldquo;Well, thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I know your father fairly well,&rdquo; she
continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never see the man,&rdquo; Peregrine replied
with a sneer, warning her off the topic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Then after a pause, she asked, &ldquo;Did you mean it? Do
you really feel that an especially large hatch is coming?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, finally admitting the
truth.</p>

<p>Then before his honesty evaporated, he added, &ldquo;There
are no trends, and I don&rsquo;t have intuitions. And I never, ever
see into the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something in those words made the old woman laugh. Then
quietly, with a sudden tenderness, she said, &ldquo;Darling.
Everybody sees some little part of the future. Only the dead
can&rsquo;t. And if you think about it, you&rsquo;ll
realize&hellip; nothing more important separates big-eyed us from
poor cold blind them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>There was nothing to add after Peregrine&rsquo;s laughable
attempt to say &ldquo;!Eech.&rdquo; Hawking fell into a deep
silence, indistinguishable from countless others; and Peregrine
responded with his own purposeful quiet. He was sitting at one end of
the hangar, working with the latest data about hatches and
gen&shy;eral Polypond activity. His friend stood near the raider
ship. Which was less animated, that sleeping machine or the alien?
Hours and even days might pass, and the creature wouldn&rsquo;t
move one antenna. Yet Hawking claimed to never feel lonely or bored.
&ldquo;A respectable mind always has fascinating tasks waiting in
its neurons,&rdquo; he would say. Which was why his very odd
species lacked the words to describe painful solitude or empty time.</p>

<p>The day&rsquo;s hatches were distant and scarce.</p>

<p>Peregrine finally gave up the hunt. He sat at the end of the
diamond blis&shy;ter, feeling the cold of deep space and studying
the ever-changing scenery below. Clouds were gathering between their
home nozzle and the next, the thinnest and lightest clouds shoved high
above the others. This happened on occasion, and it meant nothing. But
the result was a splotch of deep blackness, larger than a healthy
continent and unpromising to the bare human eye.</p>

<p>Just to be sure, Peregrine played with infrared frequencies
and flashes of laser light to make delicate measurements. Something
inside that blackness was different, he noticed. Straight before him,
something was beginning to happen. That&rsquo;s why he
wasn&rsquo;t particularly surprised when the clouds began to split,
bleeding a strange golden light that was brighter than anything else in
view.</p>

<p>Through his own telescope, he saw the vanguards of the rising
hatch.</p>

<p>Moments later, on a shielded line, an AI expert contacted him.
With a navigational code and the simple words &ldquo;This
interests,&rdquo; the machine changed the complexion of
Peregrine&rsquo;s day and his week.</p>

<p>Having a worthy topic, he admitted to Hawking, &ldquo;I
thought I was lying to that woman. About having intuitions, I mean. But
look at this hatch! Look at the diversity. And that&rsquo;s without
being able to see much of it yet.&rdquo; His heart was pounding,
his voice dry and quick. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if anybody
has seen, ever&hellip; a hatch as big and diverse as this
one&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hawking did not move, but the hemispherical eyes absorbed the
data in a few moments. Then the complicated mouth of tendrils and
rasping teeth made a series of little motions&mdash;motions that
Peregrine had never seen before, and chose to ignore for the moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving,&rdquo; the human
announced.</p>

<p>Every raider with a working ship would be embarking now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a rich day,&rdquo;
he continued, throwing himself into the first layer of his flight suit.</p>

<p>Finally, Hawking spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are my friend,&rdquo; said the alien,
nothing about his voice out of the ordinary. &ldquo;And from all
that is possible, I wish you the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>Simplicity was the hallmark of a raider&rsquo;s ship. The
hull was made from dia&shy;mond scales bolstered with nanowhiskers,
all laid across a flexible skeleton of salvaged hyperfiber. Resting in
its berth, Peregrine&rsquo;s ship held a long, elegant shape
reminiscent of the harpoons that populated ancient novels about
fishermen and lost seas. But that narrow body swelled when liquid
hydrogen was pushed into the fuel tanks. One inefficient fusion reactor
fed a lone engine that was sloppy but powerful. The launch felt like
the end&shy;less slap of a monster&rsquo;s paw, brutal enough
to smash bone and pulverize the sternest living flesh. But like every
citizen, Peregrine was functionally immortal, blessed with repair
mechanisms that could take the stew inside a flight suit and remake the
man who had been sitting there.</p>

<p>His body died, and time leaped across a string of uneventful
minutes.</p>

<p>Opening new eyes, Peregrine found himself coasting, climbing
away from the Great Ship. Six AIs of various temperaments and skills
made up his crew. In his absence, they had continued studying the
available data. One served as his pilot, and even when Peregrine
reclaimed the helm, the machine waited at a nanosecond&rsquo;s
distance, ready to correct any glaring mistakes.</p>

<p>Inside any large hatch, the multitude of bodies came in
different shapes, different species. The AI most familiar with
mercantile matters pointed at the center of the hatch. &ldquo;These
gull-wands match those we saw fifteen years ago. Their wings had some
good-grade hyperfiber, and nearly ten percent of the collected hearts
were salvageable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gull-wands had tiny fusion reactors in their chests. One
reactor was powerful enough to light and heat a modest home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much could we make?&rdquo; Peregrine asked.</p>

<p>An estimate was generated, followed by an impressed silence
from every sentient entity.</p>

<p>But then Peregrine noticed a closer feature. &ldquo;Over
here&hellip; is that some kind of cloud?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the best guess.</p>

<p>The mass was black along its surfaces, swirling in its
interior, and through cracks that were tiny at any distance, glimmers
of a fantastically bright blue-white light emerged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything like it in the records?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was an optical similarity to clouds of tiny, extremely
swift bodies observed only eight times in the past.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my past?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in your life, no,&rdquo; one voice replied.
&ldquo;During the city&rsquo;s life, I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay. What were those bodies made of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was unknown, since none had ever been captured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So pretend we&rsquo;re seeing them,&rdquo;
he began. &ldquo;Estimate the numbers in that single
gathering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The flock is enormous,&rdquo; another AI
reported. &ldquo;In the range of ten or eleven
billion&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we want!&rdquo; Peregrine
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Skeptical whispers buzzed in his ears.</p>

<p>But the human pointed out, &ldquo;Everyone else is going
to be harvesting gull-wands. Hearts and hyperfiber are going to be
cheap for the next hun&shy;dred years. But if we find something new
and special&hellip; even gathering up just a few of
them&hellip;we could pocket several fortunes, and maybe even
upgrade our ship&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>His crew had to like the sound of that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But reaching the target,&rdquo; warned the
pilot, &ldquo;will entail burning a large portion of our
reserves&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do it now,&rdquo; Peregrine ordered,
releasing the helm.</p>

<p>And for the second time in a very brief while, his fine young
body was crushed into an anonymous jelly.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>5</p>

<p>There was no perfect consensus about what the Polypond
was&mdash;undiminished foe, mad psyche divided against itself, or
the spectacular carcass of a once great foe. And in the same fashion,
there were competing ideas about the place and purpose of the hatches.
Since the rising bodies had mouths and often fed, maybe they were one
means of pruning old tissues and re&shy;viving what remained. Or
they were infected with some new, improved genetics that had to be
spread through the greater body. Perhaps they had a punishing function,
retraining regions that their Polypond master judged too independent.
Unless of course hatches were exactly what they appeared to be:
biological storms. One or many species were enjoying a season of
plenty, and working together, those countless bodies would rise into
the highest atmosphere, spreading their precious seeds and spores as
far as physi&shy;cally possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps every answer is a little true,&rdquo;
Hawking liked to caution. &ldquo;Just as every answer is a little
bit of a lie too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flying above the hatch, Peregrine thought of his odd friend.
But only briefly, and then he consciously shoved him out of his
exceptionally busy mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Projections,&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>His ship was still plunging, its hull pulled into a teardrop
configuration, the skin superheated and his sensors half-blinded by the
plasmatic envelope. But his crew devised a simple picture showing him
vectors and projections of a future that looked ready to end in the
most miserable way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our target is accelerating,&rdquo; his pilot
announced. &ldquo;I wish to abort before we collide with
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The black mass, smooth-faced and distinctly iridescent, was
punching its way through a scattering of high clouds. Some of those
clouds were alive&mdash; vividly colored bodies as light as aerogel
and easily shredded. Other clouds were water-stained gray and red with
salts and iron, dead cells, and other detritus pushed skyward by the
mayhem. Their target was tiny compared to the entire hatch. But it was
already the tallest feature, and nothing like it had ever been seen
before. Raiders bound for distant hunting grounds were noticing it.
Even from two hundred kilometers overhead, the energies and wild
violence were obvious. And even from inside a cocoon of superheated
gases, human eyes could appreciate the beauty of so many frantic bodies
doing whatever it was they were doing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to abort,&rdquo; the pilot repeated.</p>

<p>Peregrine agreed. &ldquo;But find the best way to hold us
here, in its path. Can we do that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instantly, the machine said, &ldquo;Yes. But braking and
circling will exhaust our reserves, and there won&rsquo;t be enough
fuel for both cargo and the journey home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peregrine had guessed as much. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
compromise,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Brake and assume a gliding
shape. Where does that leave us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still dancing with the break-even point,&rdquo;
the pilot warned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So make some calls.&rdquo; Peregrine named a
few smart competitors ap&shy;proaching from more distant berths.
&ldquo;Pay them to wait above us. And share their spare fuel, when
the time comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The teardrop flipped over, the engine throwing out a
spectacular fire. Every raider knew: ships larger and more powerful
than theirs could trigger retribution. An innate reflex or a Polypond
strategy? Nobody knew. But Peregrine&rsquo;s ship was as close to
the maximum size as was allowed, and if his plume exceeded the usual
limits, even for a moment, a giant laser would pop to the surface on
the unreachable sea below, evaporating his ship and then his body, and
finally, his very worried skull.</p>

<p>But this burn went unnoticed. Then the ship rested, pieces of
its hull pull&shy;ing away, forming dragonfly wings configured to
work with the thickening winds. Each time they passed through one of
the monomolecular skins, Peregrine felt a shudder. The vibrations
worsened by the minute, growing violent and relentless, and after a
point, numbing and nearly unnoticed.</p>

<p>Countless black bodies continued to rise.</p>

<p>At home, inside the refugees&rsquo; city, lived the data
sinks that had survived from prewar times. Even the best of them were
incomplete. But inside the biological sections, Peregrine had found
digitals of fish swimming in schools&mdash;a hypnotic set of images
where tiny, almost mindless creatures managed to stay in formation,
displaying grace and a singleness of purpose that never failed to
astonish him.</p>

<p>This was the same, only infinitely more spectacular.</p>

<p>Those black bodies didn&rsquo;t ride on meat and fins, but
on tiny rockets and stubby metal wings. Perfect coordination had built
a flawless hemisphere better than five hundred kilometers wide.
Peregrine&rsquo;s best AI spotter singled out random bodies,
carefully watching as they climbed to the outside edge of the school
and then worked their way upward, reaching the cloud&rsquo;s apex
before doing a curious roll, each shucking off its little wings before
firing a larger rocket, then diving back out of sight through gaps too
tiny to see from above.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Identify one of them,&rdquo; Peregrine
suggested, &ldquo;and see when it emerges again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The spotter had already tried that, and failed. The bodies
were too simi&shy;lar, and there were too many of them. But there
was an easier, more elegant route. With the help of distant telescopes,
the AI took a thorough census of the cloud, and then it let itself feel
the gentle but precise tug made by that combined gravity. Then it
precisely measured the size of the entire swarm, and with genuine
astonishment, it admitted, &ldquo;They are growing fewer, I
think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fewer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every minute, a million bodies vanish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meaning what?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;The
cloud is shrinking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It grows, but its citizens are scarcer. And this
has been happening from the outset, I would guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pilot was managing their long fall while the
ship&rsquo;s architect con&shy;stantly adapted the shape and
stiffness of wings, and the shape and color of the fuselage. To the
best of its ability, the raider ship was trying to vanish inside the
Polypond&rsquo;s enormous sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will any little guys be left when they reach
us?&rdquo; Peregrine asked.</p>

<p>Yes. Billions still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what happens to the others? Where do they
go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Data gave clues. Neutrinos and the character of escaping light
implied a fierce heat, X-rays and even gamma rays seeping free. There
was no way to be certain, but the black bodies could be simple
machines&mdash;lead-doped hyperfiber shells wrapped around nuclear
charges, for instance. If those bombs were detonating, then the
interior of that cloud was hell: a spherical volume perhaps one hundred
kilometers in diameter with an average temperature hotter than the guts
of most suns.</p>

<p>What would anyone want with so much heat?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cloud is a weapon,&rdquo; Peregrine
muttered, feeling horrible and sure. His first instinct was to glance
at the rocket nozzle behind them, imagin&shy;ing the very worst: a
bubble of superheated plasmas was being woven here, ready to be flung
up and out into space, like a child&rsquo;s ball aimed for a target
several thousand kilometers wide. Drop that creation into the nozzle,
and, after a soundless flash, the city would cease to be.</p>

<p>But how would the Polypond launch the bubble?</p>

<p>The AIs were scrambling for answers. It was the
ship&rsquo;s architect that imag&shy;ined the next nightmare.
What if the bubble wasn&rsquo;t going to be thrown, but instead it
was dropped? If it was flung onto the Great Ship&rsquo;s
hull&hellip; on the backside of the Ship, where the hyperfiber was
thinnest&hellip; could it punch a hole into the hallways and
habitats below?</p>

<p>Probably not, the majority decided.</p>

<p>But Peregrine and the architect wouldn&rsquo;t give up
their nightmares. Since the war had ended, no one had seen energies
approaching what was being seen today. But what if the Polypond had
been waiting patiently since the war&rsquo;s end, silently
gathering resources for this one spectacular attack&hellip; ?</p>

<p>Both solutions were possible and awful, and both were wrong.</p>

<p>The black cloud was still fifty kilometers below, and
simulations were furiously working, and that was when a third, even
stranger answer appeared with a withering flash of blue-white light.</p>

<p>In a blink, the top of that shimmering black mass parted.</p>

<p>Evaporated.</p>

<p>And from inside that carefully sculpted furnace sprang a shape
at once familiar and wrong&mdash;a sphere of badly stressed,
heavily eroded hyperfiber that was just a few kilometers across but
rising fast on a withering plume of exhaust.</p>

<p>Making its frantic bid to escape: a starship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reconfigure us now!&rdquo; Peregrine shouted.
&ldquo;Whatever it takes get us out of the
way&hellip;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>6</p>

<p>On occasion, Peregrine and his inhuman friend discussed the
Great Ship and what might or might not be found within its unreachable
interior. One despairing possibility was that the Polypond
hadn&rsquo;t destroyed the ancient vessel, but it had managed to
annihilate both crew and passengers, leaving no one besides a few souls
clinging to life outside. On the opposite end of the spectrum sat the
most hopeful answer: life aboard the Ship was exactly as it had always
been, peaceful and orderly, and the captains were still in charge, and
the Polypond had been defeated, or at least fought to a meaningful
armistice. And if that was true, then for a host of perfectly fine
reasons, nobody at present was bothering to poke their heads out of the
living ocean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t explain this new
acceleration,&rdquo; Peregrine would point out. &ldquo;The
engineers and captains&hellip; everybody everywhere&hellip;
they assumed that these big rockets were the only engines. But plainly,
they weren&rsquo;t. Obvi&shy;ously, they weren&rsquo;t even
the most powerful thrusters available.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is quite the puzzle,&rdquo; Hawking conceded.</p>

<p>The acceleration was not huge, but to make anything as massive
as the Great Ship move faster&hellip; well, that was an impressive
trick. &ldquo;The captains found something new during the
war,&rdquo; Peregrine suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A talent hidden until now,&rdquo; his friend
added. &ldquo;That notion has a delight&shy;ful sourness about
it, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sour was sweet to the leech.</p>

<p>Peregrine would narrow his gaze, imagining captains standing
in a crowded, desperate bridge. &ldquo;They wanted to outmaneuver
the Polypond. That&rsquo;s why they kicked the new motors awake,
and now they can&rsquo;t stop them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A compelling possibility. I agree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Peregrine didn&rsquo;t believe his own words.
&ldquo;That still won&rsquo;t explain why the captains
don&rsquo;t come out to get us. Even if they don&rsquo;t
suspect anybody&rsquo;s here, they should send up teams to scout
the situation&hellip; and even better, to send messages home to the
Milky Way&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Long limbs acquired the questioning position. &ldquo;Where
would you expect them to appear?&rdquo; Hawking asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inside one of the nozzles. I would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>Peregrine offered his reasons as he thought of them.
&ldquo;Because the Polypond can&rsquo;t reach inside the
nozzles. Because the captains could pretty easily work their way
through the barricades and hyperfiber plugs. And be&shy;cause from
the nozzle floor, they&rsquo;d have an unobstructed view of the
galaxy, and they would be able to measure our position and
velocity&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The barricades are significant,&rdquo; the
alien cautioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To us, they are. We don&rsquo;t have the energy
or tools to cut through the best grades of hyperfiber.&rdquo;
Shaking his head, he said, &ldquo;From what I&rsquo;ve heard,
when my mother&rsquo;s ship was damaged, she spent her free time
trying to find some route to the interior. She explored at least a
thousand of the old accessways leading down from here.&rdquo; Every
tunnel, no matter how obscure, was blocked with hyperfiber too deep and
stubborn to cut through. &ldquo;But if there were captains below
us, and if only a fraction of the old reactors were working&hellip;
they could still punch out in a matter of years&hellip; maybe
weeks&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So there are no captains,&rdquo; Peregrine
would decide. Every time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which means what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody else is in charge of the Great
Ship.&rdquo; That answer seemed obvious, and it was inevitable, and
it made a good mind usefully worried. Yet that answer was a most
frustrating creation, since it opened doors into an infinite range of
possibilities, imaginable and otherwise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is in charge?&rdquo; Hawking would ask, on
occasion.</p>

<p>A few powerful species were obvious candidates. But each of
them would have sent teams to the surface. They might be different
species, but they would be drawn by the same reasons and needs that
humans would feel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the culprit is someone else,&rdquo;
Hawking would propose. &ldquo;An or&shy;ganism you
haven&rsquo;t thought to consider.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anything was possible, yes.</p>

<p>Peregrine threw his ape arms into a posture that mimicked his
friend&rsquo;s, underscoring the importance of his next words.
&ldquo;Nobody here is looking for a route down,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s been what? A thousand years since
anyone has even tried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three hemispherical eyes were bright and still.</p>

<p>Peregrine continued. &ldquo;Once I get enough savings in
the bank, I&rsquo;ll take up my mother&rsquo;s other work. Just
to see what I can see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That could be a reasonable plan,&rdquo; Hawking
would say.</p>

<p>Then most of the time, their conversation ended. Peregrine
often made that promise to himself, but he never had the resources or
the simple will to invest in the luxury of a many-year search. Besides,
he was the finest raider in the city, and raiders were essential. If he
gave up his present work, the level of poverty everywhere would rise.
Citizens would have to forgo having children and new homes. At least
that was his excuse to wait for an&shy;other decade or two, biding
time before setting out on what surely would be a useless adventure.</p>

<p>Hawking never questioned Peregrine&rsquo;s lack of action.
But then again, that creature was ancient and eerily patient, and who
knew how many promises he had made to himself during the last eons, all
bound up inside his powerful mind, waiting to be fulfilled?</p>

<p>One day, Peregrine surprised himself; he imagined a fresh
candidate and a compelling logic that would explain the mystery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Great Ship,&rdquo; he
offered.</p>

<p>The !eech was silent, but there was a different quality to his
posture, and even the crystalline eyes looked brighter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Ship itself has come to life,&rdquo; the
young man proposed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why would that be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe it finally had enough
of human beings at the helm, this damned Polypond trying to kill it,
and all the rest of these unpleasant creatures running around inside
it. So one day, it just woke up and said, &lsquo;Screw you. From
here on, <em>I&rsquo;m</em> in
charge!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; his friend offered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what if&hellip; ?&rdquo; Peregrine
continued. Swallowing and then smiling, he asked, &ldquo;What if we
aren&rsquo;t just following some random line? Instead of heading
out into nothingness, the Ship is actually steering us toward a
genu&shy;ine destination?&rdquo; Then he laughed in a tight,
nervous fashion. &ldquo;What if our voyage has only just begun,
Hawking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a momentary silence.</p>

<p>Then his friend replied, &ldquo;Every voyage has just
begun. If you consider those words in the proper
way&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>7</p>

<p>Buried in those old data sinks were schematics for a host of
impossible machines&mdash;devices too intricate or demanding to be
built by refugees and their children. Included were wondrous starships
like those that once brought passengers to the Great Ship. Peregrine
had always dreamed of seeing vessels like those, and judging by the
spectrums, that&rsquo;s what the ap&shy;parition was: an
armored starship equipped with a streakship drive, efficient and
relentless, yet operating at some minuscule fraction of full throttle.
With just that whisper of thrust, the gap between him and it closed in
an instant. Peregrine&rsquo;s ship was a tiny, toyish rocket that
barely had time enough to fold its wings and kick itself out of the
way. The rising starship missed Per&shy;egrine by less than ten
kilometers. The silvered ball of hyperfiber stood on a plume of hard
radiations, the exhaust narrow at the nozzle but widening as it drove
downward, scorching heat causing it to explode outward into an
atmosphere that was cooked to a broth of softer plasmas, a stark
blue-white fire betraying only the coldest of the unfolding energies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run!&rdquo; he ordered.</p>

<p>His pilot had already made that panicked assessment. Using the
last shreds of its wings, the raider ship tilted its nose and leaped
toward space, not following the starship so much as simply trying to
keep ahead of the awful fire. The black mass beneath them continued to
churn and spin. And the living ocean below everything could see the
starship too, a thousand defensive systems triggered, the burning air
suddenly full of laser bursts and particle beams and a host of slow
ballistic weapons that could never catch their target. Whatever the
reason for fighting, hatred or simple instinct, the Polypond employed
every trick in its bid to kill its opponent. And that&rsquo;s when
Peregrine&rsquo;s tiny ship was kissed by one of the lasers, a
portion of his hull and two entire wings turned to carbon ash and a
telltale glow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reconfigure!&rdquo; he screamed.</p>

<p>The AIs began shuffling the surviving pieces, pulling their
ship back into a rough shape that might remain whole for another few
moments.</p>

<p>But the main fuel tank was pierced, leaking and unpatchable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t make it home,&rdquo; was the
uniform verdict.</p>

<p>Peregrine had already come to that grim conclusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hunt for help,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s close&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one is,&rdquo; he heard.</p>

<p>The surviving portions of the black mass were still churning,
a few bil&shy;lion fusion bombs riding little rockets. It was a
useless gesture, Peregrine believed. But then he noticed how the cloud
was changing as it moved, acquiring a distinct pancake-shaped base
above which a tiny fraction of the bombs were gathering, pulling
themselves into a dense, carefully stacked bundle.</p>

<p>In a shared instant, the pancake below ignited itself.</p>

<p>The resulting flash dwarfed every bolt of laser light, and
even the stardrive faded from view. A hypersonic slap struck the last
of those bombs, destroy&shy;ing most but throwing the rest of them
skyward at a good fraction of light-speed. Then as the bombs passed
into the last reaches of the atmosphere, they gave themselves one last
shove, rockets carrying them close enough that the starship was forced
to react, shifting its plume slightly, evaporating every last one of
its pursuers.</p>

<p>But the pancake burst had launched more than just bombs. A fat
por&shy;tion of the atmosphere was being shoved upward, and soon it
would stand higher than Peregrine had ever seen. More out of instinct
than calculation, he said, &ldquo;Try wings again, and ride this
updraft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t lift them much, no. But the soaring
maneuver would keep them at a safer altitude for a little while longer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now are there any raiders who can reach
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several, maybe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Offer them anything,&rdquo; Peregrine told his
mercantile AI. &ldquo;Thanks. Money. My family name. Whatever
works.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moments later, a deal was secured.</p>

<p>The airborne wreckage of his ship continued to jump and lurch
through the blazing atmosphere. Life support was close to failing, and
once it did, his body would cook and temporarily die. Peregrine
invested his last conscious moments looking up at the streakship,
watching as it broke into true space, that relentless engine throwing
back a jet of plasma that grew even thinner and hotter as it began to
finally throttle up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yell at the ship,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>

<p>That brought confused silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Assume there&rsquo;s a tribe of humans
onboard,&rdquo; he instructed his AIs. &ldquo;Curse at them and
blame them for all our miseries. Say whatever you have to, but get them
to talk back to us&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then what?&rdquo; asked his pilot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember everything they say,&rdquo; he
muttered as his lips burned. &ldquo;And everything they
don&rsquo;t say too&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>8</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were once an engineer,&rdquo; he had
whispered to Fusillade. &ldquo;But not anymore, I have to
believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The arbitrary moment on the clock called
&ldquo;morning&rdquo; was approaching. The two humans were
sleepy and physically spent. But Peregrine found the energy to explain,
&ldquo;I know every engineer. By face. By name. By skills. After
all, I am a raider.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of you founders are helping us fly. Your
children and grandchil&shy;dren, sure. But never you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; he allowed.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t keep track of you. I mean humans and
harum-scarums, the fef and all the others&hellip; those lucky ones
who founded our city. I doubt if I could attach ten faces to the right
names, since most of you seem happy to keep close to each
other&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The only response was a smile, thin and wary.</p>

<p>Peregrine grew tired of this dance. &ldquo;So what do you
do with your time?&rdquo; he finally asked.</p>

<p>The smile brightened. &ldquo;I study.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The subject?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many matters.&rdquo; The woman was taller than
Peregrine, and stronger. She pushed on his chest&mdash;pushed
harder than necessary&mdash;and he felt his heart beating against
the flat of her palm. Then very quietly, Fusillade asked,
&ldquo;What do you know about your half brother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peregrine offered a crisp, inadequate biography of a man who
lived and died long ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your two sisters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were three siblings in all. Two were raiders who
eventually didn&rsquo;t return from their missions, while that
final sister had followed their mother&rsquo;s other pursuit,
hunting for a route back into the Great Ship. But a crude plasma drill
exploded during testing, obliterating most of her mind along with her
bones and meat.</p>

<p>With a shrug, Peregrine confessed, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think about them very often. Different fathers, and we
never knew each other&hellip; and all that&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>His lover winked and said, &ldquo;You know, he was their
friend too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know who.&rdquo; The smile had been
replaced by a genuinely cold expression, eyes weighing everything they
saw&mdash;not unlike the leech eyes. &ldquo;He wore different
names, yes. But he was a companion to your sisters and your brother
too. They weren&rsquo;t as good friends as you are to him, but he
was always close. And when your mother had no living children, he would
strike up relationships with whoever seemed to be the best
raider.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that story before,&rdquo;
Peregrine muttered. Then with a pride that took him a little by
surprise, he added, &ldquo;Yeah, everyone says that I&rsquo;ve
got some odd tie with Hawking, or whatever he wants to call
himself&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what about your mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She and the alien knew each other. Not at first,
no. At least, nobody in my circle remembers any relationship. But your
mother invited your dear companion along when she went below, hunting
for an open road to the Great Ship. I&rsquo;m sure you can imagine
why. That leech could slip his way into some amazingly tiny crevices,
if he had to&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peregrine was perfectly awake now.</p>

<p>Quietly, firmly, the ageless lover said, &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t want you to mention this to your good friend. What
I&rsquo;m sharing, I mean. Let&rsquo;s keep it between
ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again and again, the young man realized that he knew little
about any&shy;thing. Looking at the woman&rsquo;s stiff,
unreadable face, he asked again, &ldquo;What exactly do you do with
your time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still an engineer,
aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The founders, and particularly the oldest of
you&hellip; each of you have celebrated tens of thousands of
birthdays. Minds like yours have habits, and habits don&rsquo;t
easily change.&rdquo; Now he sat up and pushed against her chest.
The woman had a peculiar asymmetry&mdash;a giant black nipple
tipped the small hard right breast, while its large and very soft
neighbor wore a tiny silver cap. Between the breasts lay a heart
beating faster than he expected. &ldquo;So tell me: what kind of
engineering do you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mostly, I buy useless items in the
markets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which items?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pieces of neural networks. You know, the little
brains of those big corpses that you bring home&hellip; from
gull-wands and clowners and the rest of the free-ranging
bodies&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those brains were always tiny, simple of design, and often
mangled or burned. Generations of raiders had collected the trinkets,
and not even the largest few had shown any hint of sentience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe as individual fragments, they&rsquo;re
simple.&rdquo; She pulled Peregrine&rsquo;s other hand over her
chest, and smiled. &ldquo;But if you splice them together, very
carefully&hellip; if you spend a few thousand years doing little
else&hellip; you&rsquo;ll cobble together something that
captures a portion of one genuine soul. Maybe it&rsquo;s the
Polypond&rsquo;s mind, maybe something else. Whatever it is,
you&rsquo;ll find memories and images and ideas&hellip; and on
occasion, you might even hear some timely, important
news&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such as?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She refused to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what does this have to do with
Hawking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe nothing,&rdquo; she replied with an
agreeable tone. &ldquo;But now that you mention it: what should we
say about that very good friend of yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>9</p>

<p>In the end what was saved was too small and far too mutilated
to reconstitute itself. Peregrine was a lump of caramelized tissue
surrounding a fractured skull that held a bioceramic brain cut through
by EM surges and furious rains of charged particles. The damage was so
severe that every memory and tendency and each of his precious personal
biases had to migrate into special shelters, and life had ceased
completely for a timeless span covering almost eighteen days. Death
held sway&mdash;longer than he had ever known, Nothingness
ruled&mdash;and then after a series of quick tickling sensations
and flashes of meaningless light, the raider found himself recovered
enough that his soul migrated out of its hiding places and his newest
eyes opened, gazing at a face that was not entirely unexpected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The streakship,&rdquo; he blurted with his new
mouth. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A limb touched his mouth and both cheeks, and then another
limb touched his chest, feeling his heart. The limbs were soft, strong,
and human&mdash; a woman&rsquo;s two hands&mdash;and then
he heard her voice saying, &ldquo;Gone,&rdquo; with finality.
&ldquo;Gone now. Gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It got away safely?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She said, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; with a nod, then with her
eyes, and finally with a whisper. And she leaned closer, adding,
&ldquo;The streakship has escaped, yes. Eighteen days, and
it&rsquo;s still accelerating. Faster than you would ever guess, it
is racing toward the Milky Way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peregrine tried to move, and failed. His legs and arms were
only half-grown, wearing wraps filled with blood and amino acids. But
he could breathe deeply, enjoying that sensation quite a lot.
&ldquo;What about my crew?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Degraded, but alive.&rdquo; The
woman&rsquo;s face was pleased and a little as&shy;tonished,
telling him, &ldquo;At the end, when you were rescued&hellip;
when that other raider plucked you out of the mayhem&hellip; the
AIs were flying what was really just a toy glider, barely as big as me,
and with maybe a tenth my mass&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peregrine tried to absorb his good fortune. How could you even
calcu&shy;late the long odds that he had crossed?</p>

<p>The ancient woman sat back, biding her time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the streakship ever talk?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She nodded and smiled wistfully,
and then with a matter-of-fact shrug, she added, &ldquo;As soon as
the streakship got above us, it hit us with a narrow-beam broadcast.
Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did it say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Life survives inside the Great Ship,&rdquo; she
reported. &ldquo;But our old leaders, the wise and powerful
captains&hellip; they&rsquo;re gone now. All of them. Either
dead or in hiding somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is in charge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From what the streakship told us, passengers are
fending for themselves.&rdquo; The woman paused, studying his new
face. Then she quietly mentioned, &ldquo;However, there is one
exceptionally obscure species that&rsquo;s come into some
prominence. In fact, at the end of the Polypond War, they took control
of the Great Ship&rsquo;s helm.&rdquo; She offered a flickering
wink, and then added, &ldquo;And, oh&hellip; now that I
mentioned that&hellip; guess who else has gone away&hellip; ?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody you know&hellip;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even before your body arrived home, he picked up
his shell, and by the looks of it, scuttled away&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>10</p>

<p>Peregrine was perfectly healthy and profoundly poor. The
raider who saved him had acquired most of his assets, while his debts
to the hospital remained substantial, possibly eternal. He had no ship,
and his crew was repaired and working with others. Several investors
came forward, offering to pay for a new ship in return for a fat
percentage of all future gains. But the only fair offer was a brief
contract from his father, and for a variety of reasons,
per&shy;sonal and otherwise, the young man decided to send it back
unsigned and follow an entirely new course.</p>

<p>If you live cheaply and patiently, it takes astonishingly
little money to keep you breathing and content.</p>

<p>For most of a century, Peregrine stalked the deep tunnels and
access ports that laced the Ship&rsquo;s central nozzle. Armed with
maps left behind by his mother and sister, he hunted for routes they
might have missed. He man&shy;aged to find two or three every year,
but each one was inevitably plugged with the high-grade hyperfiber. It
was easy to see why no one kept up this kind of search for long. Yet
Peregrine refused to quit, if only because the idea of failure gave his
mouth such an awful taste.</p>

<p>New lovers drifted in and out of his life.</p>

<p>He occasionally saw the old lady engineer, meeting her for a
meal and con&shy;versation. They hadn&rsquo;t slept together in
decades, but they remained friendly enough. Besides, she had a sharp
mind and important connections, and sometimes, when she was in the
mood, she gave him special knowledge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You knew a big hatch was coming,&rdquo;
Peregrine accused her. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you seduced me
when you did. Somehow, you and your founder friends pieced together
clues that the rest of us don&rsquo;t ever get to see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet that hatch, big as it was, was just a secondary
phenomenon,&rdquo; she ex&shy;plained. &ldquo;Like blood
from a fresh cut. I won&rsquo;t tell exactly how we knew, but we
did. And what was more important was that someone or something had
emerged from one of the old ports. We had reason to believe that an
armored vessel was pushing through the Polypond ocean, heading our
way&hellip; pre&shy;sumably to get into a useful position
before jumping free of the Ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you suspected Hawking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For thousands of years, I did. We did.&rdquo;
Fusillade nodded, and then said, &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t
official. But in the final seconds of the War, a few messages
ar&shy;rived from the interior. They were heavily coded military
broadcasts, which is why they aren&rsquo;t common knowledge. They
describe the creatures that were taking over the battered Ship. The
leech, the broadcasts called them. And not wanting to alert the spy in
our midst, we decided to keep those secrets to ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; Peregrine
countered. &ldquo;Why not make a public announcement?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because we don&rsquo;t want to panic our
children, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I panicking?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In slow motion, you are. Yes.&rdquo; The
ancient engineer sat back in her chair, tapping at the heart nestled
between her unequal breasts. &ldquo;Spending your life searching
for a way into the Ship, when we are as certain as we can be that there
is no way inside&hellip;yes, I think that&rsquo;s genuinely
panicked behavior.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hawking disappeared to someplace,&rdquo; he
replied. &ldquo;That means there&rsquo;s at least one route off
this nozzle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he went back into the Great Ship, perhaps. But
for all we know, he&rsquo;s walking today on a living cloud off on
some distant piece of the Polypond&rsquo;s body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peregrine had wasted decades walking empty hallways and
dangling from soft glass ropes. He could have wasted a thousand
centuries before find&shy;ing the relevant clue. But he was a lucky
individual, and he had the good fortune of becoming lost at the proper
moment. After two wrong turns, he found himself standing beside a tiny
chute exactly like ten thousand other chutes. Except, that is, for the
marks left behind by a delicate limb that had been dipped in paint. No,
in blood. A blackish alien blood with a distinc&shy;tive flavor,
and the writing was a familiar script, showing the simple word
&ldquo;HAWKING,&rdquo; followed by a simple yet elegant arrow
pointing straight down.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>11</p>

<p>The chute ended with a vast airless room built for no
discernible purpose. Its walls were half a kilometer tall, and the
floor was a circular plain covering perhaps ten square kilometers of
featureless hyperfiber&mdash;stuff as old as the Ship, far better
than any grade that could be chiseled through today. The only obvious
doorway led out into the dormant rocket nozzle. Peregrine set up a
torch in the room&rsquo;s center, and then he kneeled, searching
that expanse with a powerful night scope. He should have missed the
second doorway. If anyone else had ever visited this nameless place,
they surely would have ignored what looked like a crevice, horizontal
and brief. But someone was standing in front of the
opening-&mdash;a distinctive alien wearing a gossamer lifesuit, his
long jointed legs locked into a comfortable position, the body
motionless now and perhaps for a very long while.</p>

<p>Peregrine walked a few steps, then broke into a hard run.</p>

<p>On their private channel, Hawking said, &ldquo;You look
fit, my friend. And rather troubled too, I see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; Peregrine
blurted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Waiting for you,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you are my friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t particularly believe
that,&rdquo; said Peregrine. &ldquo;From what I&rsquo;ve
heard, the leech are my enemies&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have injured you how many times?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; he thought, saying nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Hawking. &ldquo;What
precise treacheries am I guilty of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. You tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>Peregrine had invested years wondering what he would say,
should this moment arrive. &ldquo;Why live with us?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;Were you some kind of spy? Were you sent here to
watch over us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a pause, then a cryptic comment. &ldquo;You
know, I saw you enter&shy;ing this place. I saw that quite
easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been climbing toward you for several
hours,&rdquo; Peregrine complained. &ldquo;Of course you saw
me&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he hesitated, rolling the alien&rsquo;s confession
around in his head.</p>

<p>With relentless patience, Hawking waited.</p>

<p>Peregrine slowed his gait, asking, &ldquo;How long have
you been watching my approach?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since your birth,&rdquo; the leech confessed.</p>

<p>Peregrine stopped now.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of reflection, he said, &ldquo;Those
eyes of yours&hellip; they see into the future&hellip;
?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they see everything that&rsquo;s going to
happen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do your eyes absorb everything there is to
see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peregrine shook his head. &ldquo;A limited sight, is that
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the distant legs lifted high, signaling agreement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What else can you see, Hawking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I have never hurt you,&rdquo; the alien
repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My half sister&hellip; the one who died in the
plasma blast&hellip; did you arrange that accident?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But did you see the accident approaching?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why did you come up on the hull, Hawking? The
only reason I can think of is to spy on us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An obvious answer. And your imagination is richer
than that, my friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hard as it was to believe, the apparent compliment forced
Peregrine to smile. &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;You wanted to spy on our future. We&rsquo;re an
in&shy;dependent society, free of the leech, and maybe
you&rsquo;re scared of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is an interesting assessment, but
mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In time, you will,&rdquo; the leech promised.</p>

<p>Then every one of its limbs was moving, carrying the creature
backward into the narrow, almost invisible crevice. Peregrine began to
run again, in a full sprint; but he was still half a kilometer from his
goal when a warm gooey stew of fresh hyperfiber flowed into view,
filling the crevice and pushing across the slick floor, glowing in the
infrared as it swiftly cured.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>12</p>

<p>The final doorway had been opened just enough for a small
human wearing a minimal lifesuit to slip through, and, walking alone,
he then stepped onto a frigid, utterly flat plain. During the War,
portions of the Polypond had splashed into the giant nozzle, dying here
or at least freezing into a useless hibernation. Peregrine strode out
to where he found a modest telescope as well as a set of telltale
marks. His friend once stood here, those powerful eyes of his linked to
the light-hungry mirror. By measuring the marks in the ice, and with
conservative estimates of the heat lost by Hawking&rsquo;s
lifesuit, Peregrine guessed that the creature had stood here for many
years, pulling up his many feet when they had melted to uncomfortable
depth, then danc&shy;ing over to a fresh place before reclaiming
his watchful pose.</p>

<p>Peregrine lay on his back now, slowly melting into the dead
ice, and he fixed the same telescope to his eyes and purposefully
stared at the sky.</p>

<p>The little city was barely visible&mdash;a sprinkling of
tiny lights and heat sig&shy;natures threatening to vanish against
the vast bulk of the timeless and utterly useless nozzle. Millions of
souls were up there, breeding and spreading out farther in a profoundly
impoverished realm. Yet despite all of their successes, they seemed to
have no impact on a scene that dwarfed all men and their eternal urges.</p>

<p>What wasn&rsquo;t the nozzle was the galaxy.</p>

<p>Here was what the leech had been watching. Hawking had lived
for thousands of years in a place that offered him comfort and the
occasional companionship. But once the streakship had left, carrying
its important news to the universe beyond, the creature&rsquo;s
work had begun: sitting on this bitter wasteland, those great eyes had
been fixed on three hundred billion suns. Peregrine studied the
maelstrom of stars and worlds, dust and busy minds; and perhaps for the
first time in his life, he appreciated that this was something greater
than any silly Polypond. Here lay an ocean beyond any other, and
someday, in one fashion or another, a great hatch would rise from
it&mdash;furious bodies riding upon a trillion, trillion wings,
reaching for this prize that has been lost.</p>

<p>This Great Ship.</p>
