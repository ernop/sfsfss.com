<p>rolific British writer Peter F. Hamilton has sold to <em>Interzone,
In Dreams, New Worlds, Fears</em>, and elsewhere. He sold his
first novel, <em>Mindstar Rising</em>, in 1993, and
quickly followed it up with two sequels, <em>A Quantum Murder</em>
and <em>The Nano Flower</em>. Hamilton's first three books
didn't attract a great deal of attention, on this side of the Atlantic
at least, but that changed dramatically with the publication of his <em>next</em>
novel, <em>The Reality Dysfunction</em>, a huge modern
space opera (it needed to be divided into two volumes for publication
in the United States) that was itself only the start of a projected
trilogy of staggering size and scope, the Night's Dawn trilogy, with
the first volume followed by others of equal heft and ambition (and
which also raced up genre bestseller lists), <em>The Neutronium
Alchemist</em> and <em>The Naked God</em>. The
Night's Dawn trilogy put Hamilton on the map as one of the major
players in the expanding subgenre of the New Space Opera, along with
writers such as Dan Simmons, Iain Banks, Paul McAuley, Gregory Benford,
Alastair Reynolds, and others; it was successful enough that a regular
SF publisher later issued Hamilton's reference guide to the complex
universe of the trilogy, <em>The Confederation Handbook</em>,
the kind of thing that's usually done as a small-press title, if it's
done at all. Hamilton's other books include the novels <em>Misspent
Youth</em> and <em>Fallen Dragon</em>, a collection,
<em>A Second Chance at Eden</em>, and a novella chapbook, <em>Watching
Trees Grow</em>. His most recent book is a new novel, <em>Pandora's
Star</em>. Coming up is another new novel, <em>Judas
Unchained</em>.</p>

<p>Here he shows us that, popular wisdom to the contrary, being
visited by an angel may not really be all <em>that</em>
good a thing after all&hellip;</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>Imelda leaves her modest family home as the evening shade
washes over the front garden, a coy smile lifting her maroon-glossed
lips. She's off to see her lover, a prospect which lifts her heart and
enhances her buoyant nature. The sun is slowly sinking behind the
gigantic seven hundred year-old arcology that dominates the center of
her hometown, Kuhmo, casting a shadow which methodically stretches out
to darken the town's outlying districts. It is a sharp eclipse which
she has witnessed every evening of her seventeen years. Yet the
gloaming it brings does nothing to stifle her mood; she's a happy,
beautiful girl with an enchantingly flat face and pert nose, her auburn
hair flowing below her shoulders. Tonight she's chosen a sleeveless
blue and white dress to wear, its semiorganic fabric swirling jauntily
around her long legs. Wherever she goes, she attracts wistful glances
from the boys who linger along Kuhmo's boring streets as they search
for something to do before the night is out.</p>

<p>She turns into Rustwith Street, one of the broad thoroughfares
which radiate out from the hexagonal base of the tapering arcology.
Tall novik trees line this street, as they do all the major routes
cutting through the civic center, their woolly blue-green foliage a
deliberate counterpoint to the bleak mountainous walls of the arcology.
There are vehicles driving down the wide road, primitive vehicles with
wheels powered by electric motors. This world of Anagaska has never
really benefited from the bountiful wealth flowing among the Greater
Commonwealth planets, its citizens seemingly content to bumble along
their own slow cautious development route, decades if not centuries
behind the more dynamic worlds. And this provincial town is very set in
its ways, manacled to the past by the arcology which dominates the
local mind-set much as it does the landscape.</p>

<p>There are some modern regrav capsules in the air above the
roads. Shiny colorful ovoids as big as the cars below, skimming
silently along at their regulation fifteen-meter altitude, which puts
them level with the upper branches of the trees.</p>

<p>Imelda pays the traffic no attention as she hurries along to
the caf&eacute; where she has arranged to meet her lover; like the
arcology, the buzz of vehicles is a mere background fixture. So she is
completely unaware of the chrome green capsule gliding along at walking
pace several hundred meters behind her, maintaining a steady distance.
The two Advancer Protectorate members inside are observing her through
sensors meshed with the capsule's metal skin, and a deluge of
scrutineer programs they have scattered across the local net. Their
organization might not be official, but they have access to police
codes, allowing them to pursue their clandestine business undetected
within the town's electronic and physical architecture.</p>

<p>As Imelda turns into the Urwan plaza with its throng of
pedestrians, several wolf whistles and raunchy pings are thrown in her
direction. The scrutineers examine the pings for hidden code, but the
boys and young men who sent them are intent only on compliments and
hopeful for a smile. Imelda does smile breezily, but keeps on walking.
She is using virtually none of her Advancer functions, the
macrocellular clusters supplementing her nervous system are barely
interfaced with the planetary cybersphere. Exoimages and mental icons
are folded back into her peripheral vision, untouched by her neural
hands. Secondary thought routines operating inside her macrocellular
clusters monitor several relevant events. She is pleased to see that
Sabine, her younger sister, has finally reached their aunt's house in
New Helsinki; there was a long delay at Inubo station while she waited
for the delayed regrav bus connection. Imelda is quietly relieved, she
loves her sister dearly, but Sabine is quite a ditzy girl; that kind of
foul-up was likely to panic her. Imelda's other interest is Erik
Horovi, who is not merely on time, but well ahead of schedule, waiting
for her in the Pathfinder caf&eacute;. An exoimage from the
caf&eacute;'s net reveals him to be sitting at a booth table
ordering the steward-bot to stand by. Her neural hands grip the
exoimage and expand it, sliding the focus in toward his face. His own
clusters must be alerting him to the observation for he grins round at
the camera. She sends him a tactile ping, hand-squeezing-thigh, and
says: "I'll be there soon, order for me."</p>

<p>His grin broadens at the ping, and he calls the stewardbot
over.</p>

<p>It is all manufactured. Erik, his location, his responses, are
in fact all being cooked up by a simulacrum program running in a large
processor kube on the arcology's seventy-fifth floor. The same suite of
abandoned rooms where Erik's unconscious body is lying, fastened to a
field-medical cot. But the program has fooled Imelda; she hurries on
through the plaza.</p>

<p>Her route takes her out through one of the side paths before
turning into a narrow opening between two buildings. The alleys here
form a small maze as they link up to the rear of a dozen commercial
buildings. But she's perfectly safe. The walls might be high, and old,
and dark; there may be rubbish scattered over the concrete; and there
may not be any people about, but this is Kuhmo, and she remains linked
to the cybersphere. Imelda is a thoroughly modern child of the
Commonwealth; she knows that safety and the police are only the speed
of a thought away.</p>

<p>A lustrous green regrav capsule descends into the alley ahead
of her. It's unusual, but she doesn't hesitate. She's mildly puzzled,
because it's a large capsule, and she sees it's going to be difficult
for her to squeeze around. Just how stupid and inconsiderate is the
pilot program?</p>

<p>Her link to the cybersphere falls away. Imelda comes to an
uncertain halt, frowning suspiciously at the capsule. She's never been
disconnected since the macrocellular clusters became active the year
she reached sexual maturity. The cybersphere and beyond that the
all-embracing Commonwealth Unisphere are her eternal companions; they
are her <em>right</em>, she thinks crossly. Even now, fear
is alien to her. This is the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>A malmetal door expands on the regrav capsule. Paul Alkoff
steps out. The Protectorate team's chief is a tall man, over four
hundred years old, and twenty years out of rejuvenation; like just
about everyone with an Advancer genetic heritage, his biological age is
locked into his early thirties.</p>

<p>"You're in the way," Imelda protests. "And I think your
capsule is messing with reception."</p>

<p>"Sorry about that," Paul says. A quick review of his exoimages
shows him their kube is producing an optimum digital shadow of Imelda.
Friends and family all think she's still walking along the alley en
route to the caf&eacute;. He holds his left hand up toward her, and
the smallest weapon he's wetwired with fires a stun pulse.</p>

<p>Imelda feels nothing. The world shifts around her, and she
realizes she's fallen to the ground. There is no pain from the impact,
though she knows she hit her head and shoulder hard. She heard the <em>crack</em>
they made. There is no sensation from anywhere in her body now. She can
neither blink nor move her eyeballs. However, her neural hands are not
physical, she moves them across icons, triggering every security alert
she possesses. There is no response. Shapes appear above her. Men, but
out of focus. There is more movement. She is carried into the capsule.
It is dark inside. Her mind is screaming, gibbering for help. No one
can hear, there is no linkage. She is alone.</p>

<p>The green capsule rises out of the alley and slips back into
the designated travel path above the nearest thoroughfare. It is a
brief journey to the base of the arcology, which now lies deep in the
monstrosity's umbra, then the capsule rises up the side until it
reaches the seventy-fifth floor and edges its way through a fissure in
the outer wall.</p>

<p>At one time, in the decades after the arcology was built, the
apartments up here on the upper levels were all packed to capacity, and
the central malls buzzed with activity all day long. But that was seven
hundred years ago, following the Starflyer war, when the entire
population of Hanko was relocated to Anagaska. People were grateful for
any accommodation they were given in the terrible aftermath of their
homeworld's destruction. Once they had recovered their equilibrium,
they began to build out from the arcology, covering the fresh open
landscape with new suburbs. Families started to drain away out of the
arcology to live in the less confined homes springing up along the new
grid of roads. The vision back then was for a town that would continue
to grow and establish new industries. Growth, though, proved expensive,
and investment on poor old sidelined Anagaska was never abundant. Much
cheaper and easier for the town council to refurbish sections of the
arcology to keep their community going. In later centuries, even that
philosophy stalled, and the whole edifice began to deteriorate from the
top downward. Now the giant city-in-a-building is a decaying
embarrassment, with no one capable of providing a satisfactory solution.</p>

<p>Dank water from a slimed ceiling drips on the immaculate green
skin of the regrav capsule as it settles on a cracked and buckled
concrete floor. The cavernous hall used to be an exemplary mall, with
shops, bars, and offices. Today it is a squalid embalmed memory of the
comfortable times long gone. The only light comes from rents in the
outer walls, while the ancient superstrength structural spars are
sagging as they succumb to gravity and entropy. Not even the town's bad
boys venture up to these levels to conduct their nefarious affairs.</p>

<p>Paul and his team member Ziggy Kare carry Imelda from the
capsule into one of the abandoned shops. Its walls are dry, if filthy,
and the floor is reasonably level. The stun pulse effect is slowly
wearing off, allowing Imelda to move her eyes slightly. She sees signs
of the new occupants, plyplastic furniture expanded out to form tables
and chairs, red-tinged lights, electronic equipment, power
cells&mdash;all the elements of a sophisticated covert operation.
In one of the small rooms they pass, she sees a field-medical cot. Erik
is lying on it. Her eyes widen in consternation, but her throat remains
unresponsive as she tries to shout.</p>

<p>The next room contains a great deal of equipment which she
doesn't understand. There is, however, a face she recognizes. Only a
face. Her gorgeous friend's head is sitting inside a transparent bubble
with various tubes and cables impaling its neck. The top of the skull
has been removed, allowing an invasion of gossamer-fine filaments to
penetrate the exposed brain.</p>

<p>A terrified whimper gurgles out through Imelda's numb lips.</p>

<p>"It's all right," Paul says at the sound. "I know you probably
won't believe me, but we're not going to harm you. And you'll never
remember any of this, we'll give you a memory wipe."</p>

<p>She is placed on a field-medical cot, where plyplastic bands
flow over her limbs before solidifying, holding her fast. Tears begin
to leak out of her eyes.</p>

<p>Ziggy brings over a sensor stick, and sweeps it above her
abdomen. "Damn it." He grunts in disappointment. "She's pregnant all
right. Looks like that memory checks out."</p>

<p>"How long?" Paul asks.</p>

<p>"Couple of weeks."</p>

<p>"Can you tell if it's Higher contaminated?"</p>

<p>Ziggy sighs in reluctance, the sound of someone who is forcing
himself to do the right thing. "Not from outside, not with our sensors.
We'll have to run a detailed pathology scan." His hand indicates a
clutter of equipment on a nearby table.</p>

<p>"Okay," Paul says, equally sad. "Take it out, and run the
exam."</p>

<p>Ziggy turns to the collection of medical instruments, and
picks up a disturbingly phallic device.</p>

<p>Imelda finally manages to scream.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>Of all the memories Paul was able to extract, arrival was the
clearest.</p>

<p>The angel clung to the starship's fuselage as the big
commercial freighter emerged from its wormhole a thousand kilometers
above the bright blue expanse of Anagaska's major ocean. Dwindling
violet light from the wormhole's exotic fabric washed across its face,
revealing late-adolescent features that were carefully androgynous.
With its firm jaw, it would be considered a striking and attractive
female rather than classically beautiful, while, as a male, people
would think it inclined to the delicate. The baggy white cotton shirt
and trousers it wore offered no clue as to its gender orientation.</p>

<p>As soon as the wormhole closed, the starship began to
decelerate, chasing down toward the planet where New Helsinki lurked
behind the darkness of the terminator. From its position just ahead of
the starship's engineering section, the angel could see the
archipelagos rolling past beneath. The impression of speed was such
that it felt there should be a wind blowing its long honey-colored hair
back. Instead, it just smiled across the vacuum at the world which
awaited it. Advancer senses revealed the dense electronic chatter of
the planetary cybersphere ghosting through the atmosphere, with
intangible peaks reaching out to connect with Anagaska's satellite
constellation. When the angel accessed the starport's traffic control,
it could find no hint that their flight was subject to any additional
audit, security was light, no intelligent scrutineers were probing the
starship's systems. The local Protectorate group didn't know it was
here. Not that there was ever any active presence at the starport; but
every visitor to Anagaska was quietly recorded and checked; if it had
arrived incognito, there was a small risk their identity-examiner
programs would raise a query. This way was safer, it was playing very
long odds against detection.</p>

<p>As soon as the starship fell below orbital velocity, the angel
let go. It configured the biononic organelles inside its cells to
provide a passive deflective field around itself, one that would
surreptitiously warp the active sensor radiation pouring out from the
starship's navigation network. The energy sequence flowing through its
biononics was even sophisticated enough to disguise its mass, leaving
it completely undetected as the starship raced away.</p>

<p>The angel began its long fall to the ground. It expanded its
integral force field into a lenticular shape over two hundred meters
wide. Electric-blue scintillations slithered over the surface as it
caught the first wisps of Anagaska's upper atmosphere, aerobraking in a
long curve to subsonic speed. Its descent strategy was simple enough;
the majority of its flight was out over the ocean where there would be
no one to see the telltale crimson flare of ions against the force
field as it sank ever lower, nor hear the continual thunderclap of its
hypersonic passage through the air.</p>

<p>When it reached a three-kilometer altitude, its downward
plummet had slowed to less than a hundred kilometers an hour, thanks to
the protective force field which was now over three hundred meters wide
and acting like a parachute. It was fifty kilometers out from Olhava's
western coastline when it changed the shape of the force field once
again, producing the dragonfly-wing planform which contributed to its
name.</p>

<p>An hour and a half later, the angel swooped out of the
nighttime sky to step lightly onto a sandy beach. It shut down most of
its Higher functions, pulled a pair of soft leather sandals from its
shoulder bag, and began to walk up the grassy slope to the coastal road.</p>

<p>They'd been lucky, Paul acknowledged, as soon as he'd reviewed
the arrival. A lone yachtsman had been underneath the angel as it
aerobraked, a man sailing out from Olhava to spend a long vacation amid
the archipelagos. A true sailor, who knew the seas and the skies. He'd
seen the glowing point flashing across the stars and known what it
meant; and he had a friend who had a friend who knew a Unisphere
contact code. Paul and his team had arrived at the coast that morning
to begin their tracking operation.</p>

<p>It had taken them a couple of weeks to corner the sneaky
creature as it began its mission in Kuhmo. The fight when they
surrounded it had taken out three Protectorate members and created a
firestorm in the town's college campus, but they'd eventually driven it
into a force field cage which could contain its Higher energy
functions. They loaded it into a big regrav capsule and ferried it over
to the arcology as the flames from the art block building roared up
into the night sky behind them.</p>

<p>"I would have just left," the angel said in its pleasant
melodic voice as the capsule negotiated its way through the rent in the
wall of the seventy fifth floor. "There was no need for all this."</p>

<p>"That depends whose viewpoint you're taking," Paul snapped
back. He was still shaken and infuriated by the deaths; they'd left the
bodies behind in the flames and now he was worried the heat might
damage his colleagues' memorycells. Once they were re-lifed in
replacement clone bodies they could well lose several hours of memories
since they last backed up in their secure stores.</p>

<p>"The obvious one, of course," the angel said.</p>

<p>"That's it for you, isn't it? Game over. Shake hands. All go
home."</p>

<p>The angel's pale mouth smiled. "It's the civilized thing to
do. Don't you approve of that?"</p>

<p>"Ask my three colleagues that you slaughtered back there. They
might have an opinion on just how civilized you are."</p>

<p>"As I recall, you fired first."</p>

<p>"Would you have come quietly?"</p>

<p>"So that you could perform your barbarisms on me? No."</p>

<p>"Just tell us what we need to know. Have you contaminated any
of us?"</p>

<p>"Contaminated! How I curse your corrupters. You could have
lived a rich rewarding life; instead they have condemned you to this
poverty of existence."</p>

<p>"Screw you, pal. You Highers want to condemn us to your
nonexistence. We retain the right to choose our destiny. We <em>demand</em>
the right."</p>

<p>"Two hundred billion people can't all be wrong. The Central
Commonwealth worlds have all embraced biononics&mdash;why do you
think it is called Higher civilization?"</p>

<p>Paul gave the angel an evil grin. "Self-delusion? More likely:
desperate self-justification."</p>

<p>"Why do you resist using biononics?" the angel asked, its
beautiful face frowning disparagingly. "You of all people must be aware
of the benefits they bring to a human body. Immortality without your
crude rejuvenation treatments; a society which isn't based around
industrial economics and its backward ideologies, new vistas, inspiring
challenges."</p>

<p>"Challenges? You just sit and vegetate all day long. That and
plot our downfall. What have you got to look forward to? Really? Tell
me. The only thing that awaits a Higher is downloading into Earth's
giant brain library. Why bother waiting? You know that's where you're
all heading. Just migrate there and plug yourself into that big virtual
reality in the sky, go right ahead and play mental golf for the rest of
eternity. I know the numbers downloading themselves are increasing;
more and more of you are realizing just how pointless your lives are.
We're not designed for godhood, basic human essence cannot be tampered
with. We need real challenges to satisfy ourselves with, we need to
have our hearts broken, we need to watch our children grow up, we need
to look over the horizon for new wonders, we need to build and create.
Higher civilization has none of that."</p>

<p>"The Central Commonwealth is our race's greatest creation. To
misquote an ancient lyric: do you think we don't love our children too?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure you do. But not enough to give them a choice. To be
born Higher is to stay Higher, they can't escape."</p>

<p>"They could, they just don't want to. Yet tens of millions of
ordinary Advancer humans convert to Higher every year. Does that tell
you anything?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It's simply the last step in their adventure. They've <em>lived</em>
first, they know there are different ways to exist. Only then do they
go in for your defeatist digital dreaming; they've decided that they
want to die then anyway, so what have they got to lose?"</p>

<p>"Is that what you'll do, Paul? Give in and download your
memories into Earth's repository?"</p>

<p>"When I'm finally tired of life, then I might just. But don't
expect it for another millennium or ten; it's a big galaxy."</p>

<p>"I am always saddened by how ignorant your views are."</p>

<p>"Is that: <em>my type</em>, by any chance?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Paul. Your type indeed, all you reactionary Advancers.
Advanced genes have shown you how far you can extend human evolution
and abilities; you've extended your life span, you're virtually immune
to disease, you're naturally integrated with the Unisphere, and a lot
more besides; all those abilities have brought you halfway toward us,
yet still you refuse to take the final step. Why?"</p>

<p>"Reactionary, my arse! Biononics are not part of us, they are
not derived from the genome and cannot be added to it, they are
machines. They infect the cells of your body; that is why you have to
be born with them to be truly Higher. They have to multiply in tandem
with an embryo's natural growth. Only then can they be incorporated by
every cell. It's impossible for every cell to be corrupted in an adult.
That's the difference, the crucial one. They are alien, imposed."</p>

<p>"Listen to yourself: infect. Corrupt. Impose. Alien. How small
your mind is, how closed."</p>

<p>"I am what I am. I like what I am. You will not take that away
from me, nor my children. I have that right to defend myself. If what
you are doing is an act of kindness and charity, then why did you
arrive here the way you did? Why not be open about it? Every person on
this planet can travel to the Central Commonwealth should they wish.
Why are you here to spread your culture by deceit?"</p>

<p>"The lies and prejudice you sustain leave us no choice. You're
condemning generations unborn to suffering they do not deserve. We can
save them from you."</p>

<p>Paul tilted his head to one side, and gave the angel a
superior grin. "Listen to yourself," he said with soft mockery. "And
the best thing is, I know that you're in a minority among Highers. You
disgust the majority as much as you do me."</p>

<p>"And yet they do not stop us."</p>

<p>"The price of true democracy. Now, are you going to tell me
what I need to know?"</p>

<p>"You know I cannot do that."</p>

<p>"Then this is going to get very unpleasant. For you."</p>

<p>"That's something your conscience will have to carry."</p>

<p>"I know. But this isn't the first time I've had to break one
of you. And I don't suppose you'll be the last." Paul maneuvered the
cage into place at the center of the hastily prepared interrogation
room. Equipment modules began to clamp themselves across the outside of
the restraining force fields. Eventually there was no sign of the angel
beneath the dull metal segments. Paul gave Ziggy a weary glance. "Let's
get on with it."</p>

<p>It took nine days to defeat the angel's biononics. Nine days
of negative energy spikes pounding away at the force field which its
biononics produced. Nine days of draining out its power reserves. Nine
days spent denying it food, water, and oxygen. Nine days smothered
inside a sarcophagus of machinery designed to wreck its body and all
the Higher functions it was capable of generating. Nine days to send
invasive filaments into its brain, preserving the neurones while its
ordinary body cells were burned and destroyed one layer at a time. Nine
days to kill it.</p>

<p>Eventually, the inert head was removed from the charred
remains and artificially sustained on the cusp of life. The filaments
linked Paul's thoughts to the angel's undead neurones, allowing him to
access memories as if the angel were now a subsidiary brain, nothing
more than a recalcitrant storage system grafted onto his own gray
matter. Burrowing through the stranger's thoughts was difficult, and
not even modern biochemicals could sustain the neurones indefinitely.
Decay gave them a very short time scale to work in. There was no neat
index. Human sensory experiences were very different from electronic
files, their triggers were unique, hard to guess. But Paul persevered,
extracting the missing days since its arrival in confused fragments.
Piecing together what had happened.</p>

<p>The angel had reached Kuhmo the day after it landed, renting a
modest apartment on the arcology's fifteenth floor. It merged easily
into the lives of the town's adolescents, signing on at the college,
joining several clubs. For two days, it studied potential targets.</p>

<p>Ziggy takes less than an hour to confirm the presence of
biononics in every cell of the tiny fetus.</p>

<p>"Son of a bitch," Paul grunts.</p>

<p>"I thought you'd be pleased," Ziggy says. "It means what we
did was right."</p>

<p>Paul gives Imelda a guilty glance. The girl is crying
silently, her face sticky with tears. Occasionally, she lets out a
small piteous snivel. Traumatized though she is, he still cannot grant
her the comfort of oblivion. There is one question he still has to ask.
"I don't like being forced to do what's right," Paul says. "Not this."</p>

<p>"Right," Ziggy says. He slides the dead fetus into a flash
furnace, eradicating the last trace of the angel's attempt to subvert
their world.</p>

<p>Paul leans over Imelda. "One final thing," he says, "and this
will all be over."</p>

<p>Fear squeezes yet more tears from her eyes.</p>

<p>"Did you know you were pregnant?"</p>

<p>The distraught girl opens her mouth and cries out in anguish.
"Yes," she sobs.</p>

<p>Studying her face, Paul knows she is telling the truth. There
will be no need to use drugs or other stronger methods of inquiry.
"Thank you," he says. At last he activates the sleep inducer, and her
weary eyes flutter shut.</p>

<p>"We'll need a replacement fetus," Paul says. "I can wipe
tonight's memories from her, but if we take away that entire week she
spent screwing Erik and the angel she's going to know something
happened; that kind of gap can't be covered up. A doctor will find our
tampering."</p>

<p>"Not a problem," Ziggy says. "We've got both of them; I can
fertilize one of her eggs and reimplant before morning. She'll still
have lover boy's baby. There'll be nothing for anybody to be suspicious
about."</p>

<p>"Apart from their new friend vanishing."</p>

<p>Ziggy shrugs. "Kids their age, it's hardly unusual. They all
have a dozen relationships a year, more if they can. Erik was desperate
to bring more girls back to the angel's apartment. You said he was
always going on about it; he wanted to bed Imelda's sister for a start.
Horny little devil."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Paul says. "It's about time Erik learned he has
responsibilities."</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>Erik Horovi was a perfect opportunity for the angel. Quite a
good-looking lad, but still mildly introverted, which left him
susceptible to any girl 'who befriended him. The angel shifted over
into full female mode and spent half a day talking to Erik, who was
first nervous, then delighted that such a beauty could show any
interest in him. He screwed up his courage and asked her out for a
date, trying desperately to disguise his surprise when she readily said
yes.</p>

<p>The beer and mild aerosol narcotics legitimately available in
Kuhmo's bars had a big effect on Erik's inexperienced bloodstream,
making him pleasantly inebriated early on in the evening. He talked
more easily than he really should have about the Viatak sisters,
especially Imelda, the eldest, and how he'd worshipped her from afar.
But his alluringly gorgeous new date didn't seem to mind talking about
another girl; she was, she said with an eager smile, very liberal when
it came to her own sexuality. The haze of subtle chemicals in Erik's
head did nothing to dampen his arousal as they both smiled at each
other knowingly.</p>

<p>Imelda met the angel the very next day; its memory of the
event comprised a confused montage of faces flitting across the main
quad in the collage campus, bursts of conversations, scent of the
nearby roseyew bushes that decorated the quad. The scent of flowers in
full bloom was a strong one, leading Paul onward through the memories
until he was somehow walking through a city of soaring towers and
delightful parks with vegetation that was sweetly reminiscent of
Kuhmo's public gardens. Silver-white regrav capsules slipped silently
overhead as the pink-tinged sun shone at the apex of a cloudless purple
sky. It was Teleba, one of the earliest planets to be settled, now
nestling right at the heart of the Central Commonwealth. A world of
Higher culture, where there were no urban areas decaying like the
entirety of Kuhmo, no economic hardship or market fluctuations to
perturb the population, no crime, for little was forbidden or
withheld&mdash;except for the angel's own purpose, but even that
was open to its peers. It strode along a boulevard lined by semiorganic
treesculptures whose prismatic ever-shifting leaves were modeled on New
York's unique ma-hon tree. Information and thoughts from the superdense
planetary cybersphere whirled into its mind like particles of a
multicolored snowstorm to be modified or answered, its own questions
and suggestions administered into the pervasive flow of knowledge,
arguing its ideal and ethic to those who showed an interest. Agreement
and disagreement swirled around it as it crossed a plaza with a great
fountain in the center. It felt invigorated by the debate, its own
resolution hardening.</p>

<p>The enlightened informed process was the democratic
entitlement of all Highers. People didn't have to strive, with their
material requirements supplied by Neumann cybernetics and their bodies
supported by biononics, they could devote themselves to their
uniqueness. Human thought was the pinnacle of terrestrial evolution,
Earth's most profound success. Now each mind was yoked into the
Commonwealth Unisphere, collecting, arranging, and distributing
information. Whole districts of the city were given over to institutes
that delved into science and art, multiplying into thousands of
subdisciplines. Their practitioners communed in mental harmony. Higher
culture was reaching for the Divine. <em>Can you not see the
Rightness of it, the inevitability</em>? <em>The comfort</em>?</p>

<p>Paul had to wrench his thoughts away from the guileful desire
Trojan. Even in its crippled state, the angel's brain was dangerous.
There were many elaborate traps that remained empowered amid the waning
neurones, quite capable of ensnaring the unwary. He pushed his own mind
back into the memories of Imelda and Erik.</p>

<p>There were long lazy evenings spent in the angel's secluded
apartment. Bottles and aerosols were imbibed leisurely, their contents
complemented by a chemical designed to neutralize any standard female
contraception troche. The lights were dimmed, the lovers' thoughts
sluggish and contented, bodies inflamed. Paul experienced Erik in
congress, his youthful body straining hard against the angel. There
were loud, near-savage cries of joy as he climaxed successfully.</p>

<p>Deep inside the angel's complicated sexual organs, Erik's
spermatozoon were injected with a biononic organelle.</p>

<p>Imelda's smiling, trusting face as she rolled across the
jellmattress underneath the now very male angel, unruly hair spreading
across the soft pillows. Her sharp gasp of delight at the impalement.
Wicked curl of her mouth at the arousal, and piercing cry of
fulfillment. A fulfillment greater than she knew as the modified semen
was released inside her.</p>

<p>Under the angel's tutelage, the eager youngsters experimented
with strenuous and exciting new positions night after night. Bodies
writhed against it, granting each other every request that was
whispered or shouted before granting its single wish. Each time it
focused their arousal and ecstasy to one purpose, the creation of its
beloved changeling.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>Imelda arrives home in the dead of night after staggering home
an unknown distance along the street outside. The house recognizes her
and opens the front door. She has clearly had a lively evening, her
movements lack any real coordination; she squints at most objects,
unable to perceive what they are; her electronic emissions are chaotic,
nonsensical. Every now and then, she giggles for no reason. At the
bottom of the stairs her legs fold gracelessly under her, and she
crumples into a heap. She begins snoring.</p>

<p>This is how her parents find her in the morning. Imelda groans
in protest as they rouse her; she has a hangover which is surely
terminal. Her parents fuss, and issue a mild chastisement about the
state she is in; but they are tolerant liberals, and understand the
impulses which fire all adolescents. They are not worried; after all,
this is the Greater Commonwealth, citizens are safe at night even in
dear old worn-down Kuhmo. Imelda is helped upstairs to her bed, given
water and some vitamins, and left to sleep off her night of youthful
excess.</p>

<p>When she wakes up again, around midday, she quickly calls
Erik, who himself is still recovering from his narcotic sojourn. Their
questions are almost identical: "What did we do?" As are their answers:
"I don't remember."</p>

<p>"I think we met up in the Pathfinder," Imelda says
uncertainly. "I remember going there, but afterward I don't
know&hellip;"</p>

<p>Erik jumps on this, relieved that one of them has some memory
of the evening. "We must have struck a bad aerosol," he claims
immediately.</p>

<p>"Yeah, right," Imelda agrees, even though the voice of doubt
is murmuring away inside her head. But accepting that easy explanation
is so much more comfortable than examining ideas that may have
unpleasant outcomes. "You want to meet up again tonight?" she asks.</p>

<p>"Sure, but maybe at my house. I thought we could have a
quieter time. And we need to talk about the baby, we'll have to tell
our parents."</p>

<p>"It's early days," Imelda says carelessly; she sends him a
tactile ping of a very personal nature. "Maybe not too quiet, huh?"</p>

<p>Erik grins in disgraceful delight, last night already
forgotten.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>Nine months later, Erik is grinning in an altogether different
fashion as he is present at the birth of his daughter. The little girl
is perfect and beautiful, born at the Kuhmo General Hospital with an
ease that only modern Commonwealth medical technology can provide.
Afterward, Imelda lies back on the bed in the airy delivery room, and
cuddles the newborn, lost in devotion.</p>

<p>"We have got to decide on a name," she says dreamily.</p>

<p>Erik idly brushes her mane of auburn hair away from her
shoulders. "How about Kerry?" he suggests tentatively. It is the name
he knew the angel as; he often wonders where she is now.</p>

<p>"No," Imelda says. There is still some association about Kerry
and his abrupt disappearance that she can't shake off.</p>

<p>"Okay, well, there's no rush. I'd better go out and see
everyone."</p>

<p>The respective families are waiting outside. Imelda's parents
are polite; happy that the birth has gone without a hitch, and, of
course, delighted that they have another grandchild. However, there is
a certain degree of strain showing in their outwardly civil attitude
toward Erik. His own parents are less formal, and hug him with warm
excitement. He goes over to Sabine and kisses her.</p>

<p>"Congratulations," she says.</p>

<p>Erik tenderly brushes Sabine's thick auburn hair. "This
doesn't change anything," he says sincerely. Sabine smiles back,
grateful for the reassurance, especially right now. She is Imelda's
younger sister by forty minutes, and so genuinely doesn't want their
special sibling bond soured by any jealousy.</p>

<p>As Erik confessed to Kerry, bedding the sisters was his
fantasy since the first moment he saw them. Identical twins is a common
enough desire in a hormonally active teenager; and Kerry of course made
that particular wish come true readily enough. Even today, Erik still
has trouble telling his lovers apart, and his memories of them during
those wonderful long erotic nights in that apartment on the arcology's
fifteenth floor are completely indistinguishable.</p>

<p>Now Inigo wakes up and loudly starts to demand his afternoon
feed. Sabine is immediately busy with their infant son who was born in
the very same hospital two weeks earlier.</p>

<p>She too rejected the name Kerry.</p>
