<h1>CONSTRUCTION SHACK</h1>
<h2>CLIFFORD D. SIMAK<br>
</h2>
<br>
<p><strong>Simak short story production this year was surprisingly
small&#8212;but as is to be expected of this fine and sensitive writer, he
came up with a concept that combines the infinite with the simple
curiosities of ordinary Earthlings.<br>
<br>
</strong></p>
<p>In that same year when men first walked on Mars the probe was
launched from the moon for Pluto. Five years later the first pictures
were transmitted as the orbiting probe trained its cameras on the
planet's surface. The transmission quality was poor; but even so,
certain features of the photographs were productive of great anguish as
old theories fell to shards and were replaced by puzzlement, questions
with no hint of answers. The pictures seemed to say that the planet had
a smooth, almost polished surface, without a single geographic feature
to break the smoothness of it. Except that at certain places,
equidistant from one another along the equator, were tiny dots that
would have been taken for transmission noise if they had not appeared
consistently. Too, the dots still persisted when some of the noise was
eliminated. So it seemed they must be small geographic features or
shadows cast by geographic features, although at Pluto's distance from
the sun shadows would be suspect. The other data did nothing to lessen
the anguish. The planet was smaller than supposed, less than a thousand
miles in diameter, and its density worked out to 3.5 grams per cubic
centimeter rather than the unrealistic figure of 60 grams, previously
supposed.</p>
<p>This meant several things. It meant that somewhere out there,
perhaps something more than seven billion miles from the sun, a tenth
planet of the solar system swung in orbit, for no planet the size and
mass of Pluto could explain the eccentricities in the orbits of Uranus
and Neptune. The calculation of Pluto's mass, now proved inaccurate,
had been based on the measurement of those eccentricities and it must
be admitted now that something else must account for them.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Pluto was most strange&#8212;a smooth planet, featureless
except for the evenly spaced dots. The smoothness certainly could not
be explained by a nonturbulent atmosphere, for surely Pluto had to be
too small and cold to hold an atmosphere. A surface of ice, men
wondered, the frozen remnants of a one-time, momentary atmosphere? But
for a number of reasons that didn't seem right, either. Metal, perhaps;
but if the planet were of solid metal the density should be far greater.</p>
<p>The men on Earth consoled themselves. In five more years the probe
would come back to Earth, carrying with it the films that it had taken
and from them, the actual films and not the low-quality transmissions,
perhaps much that was hazy now might become understandable. The probe
swung in its measured orbits and sent back more pictures, although they
were little help, for the quality still was poor. Then it fired the
automatic sequence that would head it back to Earth, and its beeping
signals from far out in space said it was headed home on a true and
steady course.</p>
<p>Something happened. The beeping stopped and there was a silence.
Moon Base waited. It might start up again. The silence might indicate
only a momentary malfunction and the signals might start again. But
they never did. Somewhere, some three billion miles from the sun, some
mishap had befallen the homing probe. It was never heard again&#8212;it was
lost forever.</p>
<p>There was no sense in sending out another probe until a day when
technical advances could assure better pictures. The technical advances
would have to be significant&#8212;small refinements would do little good.</p>
<p>The second and third manned expeditions went to Mars and came home
again, bringing back, among many other things, evidence that primitive
forms of life existed there, which
settled once for all the old, dark suspicion that life might be an
aberration to be found only on the Earth. For with life on two planets
in the same solar system there could no longer be any doubt that life
was a common factor in the universe. The fourth expedition went out,
landed, and did not come back again and now there was on Mars a piece
of ground that was forever Earth. The fifth expedition was sent out
even while the Earth still paid tribute to those four men who had died
so far from home.</p>
<p>Now that life had been found on another world, now that it was
apparent that another planet at one time had held seas and rivers and
an atmosphere that had been an approximation of Earth's own atmosphere,
now that we knew we no longer were alone in the universe, the public
interest and support of space travel revived. Scientists, remembering
(never having, in fact, forgotten, for it had gnawed steadily at their
minds) the puzzlement of the Pluto probe, began to plan a manned Pluto
expedition, as there was still no sense in sending an instrumented
probe.</p>
<p>When the day came to lift from the Moon Base, I was a member of the
expedition. I went along as a geologist &#8212;the last thing a Pluto
expedition needed.</p>
<p>There were three of us and any psychologist will tell you that three
is a number that is most unfortunate. Two gang up on one or ignore one
and there is always competition to be one of the gang of two. No one
wants to stand alone with the other two against him. But it didn't work
that way with us. We got along all right, although there were times
when it was rough going. The five years that the probe took to arrive
at Pluto were cut by more than half, not only because of improved
rocket capability, but because a manned craft could pile on velocity
that couldn't be programmed&#8212;or at least safely programmed&#8212;into a probe.
But a bit more than two years is a long time to be cooped up in a tin
can rocketing along in emptiness. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if you
had some sense of speed, of really getting somewhere&#8212;but you haven't.
You just hang there in space.</p>
<p>The three of us? Well, I am Robert Hunt and the other two were Orson
Gates, a chemist, and Tyler Hampton, an engineer.</p>
<p>As I say, we got along fine. We played chess tournaments&#8212;yeah, three
men in a tournament and it was all right because
none of us knew chess. If we had been any good I suppose we would have
been at one another's throats. We dreamed up dirty ditties and were so
pleased with our accomplishments that we'd spend hours singing them and
none of us could sing. We did a lot of other futile things&#8212;by now you
should be getting the idea. There were some rather serious scientific
experiments and observations we were supposed to make, but all of us
figured that our first and biggest job was to manage to stay sane.</p>
<p>When we neared Pluto we dropped the fooling around and spent much
time peering through the scope, arguing and speculating about what we
saw. Not that there was much to see. The planet resembled nothing quite
as much as a billiard ball. It was smooth. There were no mountains, no
valleys, no craters&#8212;nothing marred the smoothness of the surface. The
dots were there, of course. We could make out seven groups of them, all
positioned along the equatorial belt. And in close-up they were not
simply dots. They were structures of some kind.</p>
<p>We landed finally, near a group of them. The landing was a little
harder than we had figured it would be. The planetary surface was
hard&#8212;there was no give to it. But we stayed right-side up and we didn't
break a thing.</p>
<p>People at times ask me to describe Pluto and it's a hard thing to
put into words. You can say that it is smooth and that it's dark&#8212;it's
dark even in broad daylight. The sun, at that distance, is not much
more than a slightly brighter star. You don't have daylight on Pluto&#8212;
you have starlight and it doesn't make much difference whether you're
facing the sun or not. The planet is airless, of course, and waterless
and cold. But cold, as far as human sensation is concerned, is a
relative thing. Once the temperature gets down to a hundred Kelvin it
doesn't much matter how much colder it becomes. Especially when you're
wearing life support. Without a suit containing life support you'd last
only a few seconds, if that long, on a place like Pluto. I've never
figured out which would kill you first&#8212;cold or internal pressure. Would
you freeze&#8212;or explode before you froze?</p>
<p>So Pluto is dark, airless, cold, and smooth. Those are the externals
only. You stand there and look at the sun and realize how far away you
are. You know you are standing at the edge of the solar system, that
just out there, a
little way beyond, you'd be clear outside the system. Which doesn't
really have to be true, of course. You know about the tenth planet.
Even if it's theory, it's supposed to be out there. You know about the
millions of circling comets that technically are a part of the solar
system, although they're so far out no one ever thinks of them. YOU
could say to yourself this really is not the edge&#8212;the hypothetical
tenth planet and the comets still are out there. But this is
intellectualization; you're telling yourself something that your mind
says may be true, but your gut denies. For hundreds of years Pluto has
been the last outpost and this, by God, is Pluto and you're farther
away from home than man has ever been before and you feel it. You don't
belong to anything anymore. You're in the back alley, and the bright
and happy streets are so far away that you know you'll never find them.</p>
<p>It isn't homesickness that you feel. It's more like never having had
a home. Of never having belonged anywhere. You get over it, of
course&#8212;or come to live with it. So we came down out of the ship after
we had landed and stood upon the surface. The first thing that struck
us &#8212;other than the sense of lostness that at once grabbed all of us&#8212;was
that the horizon was too near, much nearer than on the moon. We felt at
once that we stood on a small world. We noticed that horizon's nearness
even before we noticed the buildings that the probe had photographed as
dots and that we had dropped down to investigate. Perhaps buildings is
not the right word&#8212;structures probably would be better. Buildings are
enclosures and these were not enclosures. They were domes someone had
set out to build and hadn't had time to finish. The basic underlying
framework had been erected and then the work had stopped. Riblike arcs
curved up from the surface and met overhead. Struts and braces held the
frames solid, but that was as far as the construction had gone. There
were three of them, one larger than the other two. The frames were not
quite as simple as I may have made them seem. Tied into the ribs and
struts and braces were a number of other structural units that seemed
to have no purpose and made no sense at all. We tried to make sense out
of them and out of the scooped-out hollows that had been gouged out of
the planetary surface within the confines of each construct&#8212; they had
no
floors and seemed fastened to the surface of the planet. The hollows
were circular, some six feet across and three feet deep, and to me they
looked like nothing quite as much as indentations made in a container
of ice cream by a scoop.</p>
<p>About this time Tyler began to have some thoughts about the surface.
Tyler is an engineer and should have had his thoughts immediately&#8212;and
so should the rest of us&#8212;but the first hour or so outside the ship had
been considerably confusing. We had worn our suits in training, of
course, and had done some walking around in them, but Pluto seemed to
have even less gravity than had been calculated and we had had to get
used to it before we could be reasonably comfortable. Nor had anything
else been exactly as we had anticipated.</p>
<p>"This surface," Tyler said to me. "There is something wrong with it."</p>
<p>"We knew it was smooth," said Orson. "The pictures showed that.
Coming in, we could see it for ourselves."</p>
<p>"This smooth?" Tyler asked. "This even?" He turned to me. "It isn't
geologically possible. Would you say it is?"</p>
<p>"I would think not," I said. "If there had been any upheaval at all
this floor would be rugged. There can't have been any erosion&#8212;anything
to level it down. Micrometeorite impacts, maybe, but not too many of
them. We're too far out for meteorites of any size. And while
micro-meteorites might pit the surface there would be no leveling
process."</p>
<p>Tyler let himself down on his knees rather awkwardly. He brushed a
hand across the surface. The seeing was not too good, but you could see
that there was dust, a thin layer of dust, a powdering.</p>
<p>"Shine a light down here," said Tyler.</p>
<p>Orson aimed his light at the spot. Some of the gray dust still clung
where Tyler had wiped his hand, but there were streaks where the darker
surface showed through.</p>
<p>"Space dust," said Tyler.</p>
<p>Orson said, "There should be damn little of it."</p>
<p>"True," said Tyler. "But over four billion years or more, it would
accumulate. It couldn't be erosion dust, could it?"</p>
<p>"Nothing to cause erosion," I said. "This must be as close to a dead
planet as you ever get. Not enough gravity to hold any of the gases&#8212;<em>if</em>
there ever were gases.
At one time there must have been, but they've all gone&#8212;they went early.
No atmosphere, no water. I doubt there ever was any accumulation. A
molecule wouldn't hang around for long."</p>
<p>"But space dust would?"</p>
<p>"Maybe. Some sort of electrostatic attraction, maybe."</p>
<p>Tyler scrubbed the little patch of surface again with his gloved
hand, removing more of the dust, with more of the darker surface
showing through.</p>
<p>"Have we got a drill?" he asked. "A specimen drill."</p>
<p>"I have one in my kit," said Orson. He took it out and handed it to
Tyler. Tyler positioned the bit against the surface, pressed the
button. In the light of the torch you could see the bit spinning. Tyler
put more weight on the drill.</p>
<p>"It's harder than a bitch," he said.</p>
<p>The bit began to bite. A small pile of fragments built up around the
hole. The surface was hard, no doubt of that. The bit didn't go too
deep and the pile of fragments was small.</p>
<p>Tyler gave up. He lifted out the bit and snubbed off the motor.</p>
<p>"Enough for analysis?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Should be," said Orson. He took the bit from Tyler and handed him a
small specimen bag. Tyler laid the open mouth of the bag on the surface
and brushed the fragments into it.</p>
<p>"Now we'll know," he said. "Now we will know something."</p>
<p>A couple of hours later, back in the ship, we knew.</p>
<p>"I have it," Orson said, "but I don't believe it."</p>
<p>"Metal?" asked Tyler.</p>
<p>"Sure, metal. But not the kind you have in mind. It's steel."</p>
<p>"Steel?" I said, horrified. "It can't be. Steel's no natural metal.
It's manufactured."</p>
<p>"Iron," said Orson. "Nickel. Molybdenum, vanadium, chromium. That
works out to steel. I don't know as much about steel as I should. But
it's steel&#8212;a good steel. Corrosion resistant, tough, strong."</p>
<p>"Maybe just the platform for the structures," I said. "Maybe a pad
of steel to support them. We took the specimen close to one of them."</p>
<p>"Let's find out," said Tyler.</p>
<p>We opened up the garage and ran down the ramp and got out the buggy.
Before we left we turned off the television camera. By this time Moon
Base would have seen all they needed to see and if they wanted more
they could ask for it. We had given them a report on everything we had
found&#8212;all except the steel surface and the three of us agreed that
until we knew more about that we would not say anything. It would be a
while in any case until we got an answer from them. The time lag to
Earth was about sixty hours each way.</p>
<p>We went out ten miles and took a boring sample and came back,
following the thin tracks the buggy made in the dust, taking samples
every mile. We got the answer that I think all of us expected we would
get, but couldn't bring ourselves to talk about. The samples all were
steel.</p>
<p>It didn't seem possible, of course, and it took us a while to digest
the fact, but finally we admitted that on the basis of best evidence
Pluto was no planet, but a fabricated metal ball, small-planet size.
But godawful big for anyone to build.</p>
<p>Anyone?</p>
<p>That was the question that now haunted us. Who had built it? Perhaps
more important&#8212;why had they built it? For some purpose, surely, but
why, once that purpose had been fulfilled (if, in fact, it had been
fulfilled) had Pluto been left out here at the solar system's rim?</p>
<p>"No one from the system," Tyler said. "There's no one but us. Mars
has life, of course, but primitive life. It got a start there and hung
on and that was all. Venus is too hot. Mercury is too close to the sun.
The big gas planets? Maybe, but not the kind of life that would build a
thing like this. If had to be something from outside."</p>
<p>"How about the fifth planet?" suggested Orson.</p>
<p>"There probably never was a fifth planet," I said. "The material for
it may have been there, but the planet never formed. By all the rules
of celestial mechanics there should have been a planet between Mars and
Jupiter, but something went haywire."</p>
<p>"The tenth planet, then," said Orson.</p>
<p>"No one is really positive there is a tenth," said Tyler.</p>
<p>"Yeah, you're right," said Orson. "Even if there were it would be a
poor bet for life, let alone intelligence."</p>
<p>"So that leaves us with outsiders," said Tyler.<br>
</p>
<p>"And a long time ago," said Orson.</p>
<p>"Why do you say that?"</p>
<p>"The dust. There isn't much dust in the universe."</p>
<p>"And no one knows what it is. There is the dirty ice theory."</p>
<p>"I see what you're getting at. But it needn't be ice. Nor graphite
nor any of the other things that have been&#8212;"</p>
<p>"You mean it's that stuff out there."</p>
<p>"It could be. What do you think, Robert?"</p>
<p>"I can't be sure," I said. "The only thing I know is that it
couldn't be erosive."</p>
<p>Before we went to sleep we tried to fix up a report to beam back to
Moon Base, but anything we put together sounded too silly and
unbelievable. So we gave up. We'd have to tell them some time, but we
could wait.</p>
<p>When we awoke we had a bite to eat, then got into our suits and went
out to look over the structures. They still didn't make much sense,
especially all the crazy contraptions that were fastened on the ribs
and struts and braces. Nor did the scooped-out hollows.</p>
<p>"If they were only up on legs," said Orson, "they could be used as
chairs."</p>
<p>"But not very comfortable," said Tyler.</p>
<p>"If you tilted them a bit," said Orson. But that didn't figure
either. They would still be uncomfortable. I wondered why he thought of
them as chairs. They didn't look like any chairs to me..</p>
<p>We pottered around a lot, not getting anywhere. We looked the
structures over inch by inch, wondering all the while if there was
something we had missed. But there didn't seem to be.</p>
<p>Now comes the funny part of it. I don't know why we did it&#8212;out of
sheer desperation, maybe. But failing to find any clues, we got down on
our hands and knees, dusting at the surface with our hands. What we
hoped to find, I don't know. It was slow going and it was a dirty
business, with the dust tending to stick to us.</p>
<p>"If we'd only brought some brooms along," said Orson.</p>
<p>But we had no brooms. Who in his right mind would have thought we
would want to sweep a planet?</p>
<p>So there we were. We had what appeared to be a manufactured planet
and we had some stupid structures for which we could deduce not a
single reason. We had come a long ways and we had been expected to make
some tremendous discovery once we landed. We had made a discovery,
all right, but it didn't mean a thing.</p>
<p>We finally gave up with the sweeping business and stood there,
scuffing our feet and wondering what to do next when Tyler suddenly let
out a yell and pointed at a place on the surface where his boots had
kicked away the dust.</p>
<p>We all bent to look at what he had found. We saw three holes in the
surface, each an inch or so across and some three inches deep, placed
in a triangle and close together. Tyler got down on his hands and knees
and shone his light down into the holes, each one of them in turn.</p>
<p>Finally he stood up. "I don't know," he said. "They could maybe be a
lock of some sort. Like a combination. There are little notches on the
sides, down at the bottom of them. If you moved those notches just
right something might happen."</p>
<p>"Might blow ourselves up, maybe," said Orson. "Do it wrong and bang!"</p>
<p>"I don't think so," said Tyler. "I don't think it's anything like
that. I don't say it's a lock, either. But I don't think it's a bomb.
Why should they booby-trap a thing like this?"</p>
<p>"You can't tell what they might have done," I said. "We don't know
what kind of things they were or why they were here."</p>
<p>Tyler didn't answer. He got down again and began carefully dusting
the surface, shining his light on it while he dusted. We didn't have
anything else to do, so helped him.</p>
<p>It was Orson who found it this time&#8212;a hairline crack you had to hold
your face down close to the surface to see. Having found it, we did
some more dusting and worried it out. The hairline described a circle
and the three holes were set inside and to one edge of it. The circle
was three feet or so in diameter.</p>
<p>"Either of you guys good at picking locks?" asked Tyler.</p>
<p>Neither of us were.</p>
<p>"It's got to be a hatch of some sort," Orson said. "This metal ball
we're standing on has to be a hollow ball. If it weren't its mass would
be greater than it is."</p>
<p>"And no one," I said, "would be insane enough to build a solid ball.
It would take too much metal and too much energy to
move."</p>
<p>"You're sure that it was moved?" asked Orson.</p>
<p>"It had to be," I told him. "It wasn't built in this system. No one
here could have built it."</p>
<p>Tyler had pulled a screwdriver out of his tool kit and was poking
into the hole with it.</p>
<p>"Wait a minute," said Orson. "I just thought of something."</p>
<p>He nudged Tyler to one side, reached down, and inserted three
fingers into the holes and pulled. The circular section rose smoothly
on its hinges.</p>
<p>Wedged into the area beneath the door were objects that looked like
the rolls of paper you buy to wrap up Christmas presents. Bigger than
rolls of paper, though. Six inches or so across.</p>
<p>I got hold of one of them and that first one was not easy to grip,
for they were packed in tightly. But I managed with much puffing and
grunting to pull it out. It was heavy and a good four feet in length.</p>
<p>Once we got one out, the other rolls were easier to lift. We pulled
out three more and headed for the ship.</p>
<p>But before we left I held the remaining rolls over to one side, to
keep them from tilting, while Orson shone his light down into the hole.
We had half expected to find a screen or something under the rolls,
with the hole extending on down into a cavity that might have been used
as living quarters or a workroom. But the hole ended in machined metal.
We could see the grooves left by the drill or die that had bored the
hole. That hole had just one purpose, to store the rolls we had found
inside it.</p>
<p>Back in the ship we had to wait a while for the rolls to pick up
some heat before we could handle them. Even so we had to wear gloves
when we began to unroll them. Now, seeing them in good light, we
realized that they were made up of many sheets rolled up together. The
sheets seemed to be made of some sort of extremely thin metal or tough
plastic. They were stiff from the cold and we spread them out on our
lone table and weighed them down to hold them flat.</p>
<p>On the first sheet were diagrams of some sort, drawings, and what
might have been specifications written into the diagrams and along the
margins. The specifications, of course, meant nothing to us (although
later some were puzzled out and mathematicians and chemists were able
to figure out
some of the formulas and equations).</p>
<p>"Blueprints," said Tyler. "This whole business was an engineering
job."</p>
<p>"If that's the case," said Orson, "those strange things fastened to
the structural frames could be mounts to hold engineering instruments."</p>
<p>"Could be," said Tyler.</p>
<p>"Maybe the instruments are stored in some other holes like the one
where we found the blueprints," I suggested.</p>
<p>"I don't think so," said Tyler. "They would have taken the
instruments with them when they left."</p>
<p>"Why didn't they take the blueprints, too?"</p>
<p>"The instruments would have been worthwhile to take. They could be
used on another job. But the blueprints couldn't. And there may have
been many sets of prints and spec sheets. These we have may be only one
of many sets of duplicates. There would have been a set of master
prints and those they might have taken with them when they left"</p>
<p>"What I don't understand," I said, "is what they could have been
building out here. What kind of construction? And why here? I suppose
we could think of Pluto as a massive construction shack; but why
exactly here? With all the galaxy to pick from, why this particular
spot?"</p>
<p>"You ask too many questions all at once," Orson told me.</p>
<p>"Let's look," said Tyler. "Maybe well find out."</p>
<p>He peeled the first sheet off the top and let it drop to the floor.
It snapped back to the rolled-up position.</p>
<p>The second sheet told us nothing, nor did the third or fourth. Then
came the fifth sheet.</p>
<p>"Now, here is something," said Tyler.</p>
<p>We leaned closer to look.</p>
<p>"It's the solar system," Orson said.</p>
<p>I counted rapidly. "Nine planets."</p>
<p>"Where's the tenth?" asked Orson. "There should be a tenth."</p>
<p>"Something's wrong," said Tyler. "I don't know what it is."</p>
<p>I spotted it, "There's a planet between Mars and Jupiter."</p>
<p>"That means there is no Pluto shown," said Orson.</p>
<p>"Of course not," said Tyler. "Pluto never was a planet."</p>
<p>"Then this means there once actually was a planet between Mars and
Jupiter," said Orson.</p>
<p>"Not necessarily," Tyler told him. "It may only mean there was
supposed to be."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"They bungled the job," said Tyler. "They did a sloppy piece of
engineering."</p>
<p>"You're insane!" I shouted at him.</p>
<p>"Your blind spot is showing, Robert. According to what we think,
perhaps it is insane. According to the theories our physicists have
worked out. There is a cloud of dust and gas and the cloud contracts to
form a proto-star. Our scientists have invoked a pretty set of physical
laws to calculate what happens. Physical laws that were automatic-since
no one would be mad enough to postulate a gang of cosmic engineers who
went about the universe building solar systems."</p>
<p>"But the tenth planet," persisted Orson. "There has to be a tenth
planet. A big, massive&#8212;"</p>
<p>"They messed up the projected fifth planet," Tyler said. "God knows
what else they messed up. Venus, maybe. Venus shouldn't be the kind of
planet it is. It should be another Earth, perhaps a slightly warmer
Earth, but not the hellhole it is. And Mars. They loused that up, too.
Life started there, but it never had a chance. It hung on and that was
all. And Jupiter, Jupiter is a monstrosity&#8212;"</p>
<p>"You think the only reason for a planet's existence is its
capability of supporting life?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, of course. But it should be in the specs. Three
planets that could have been life-bearing and of these only one was
successful."</p>
<p>"Then," said Orson, "there could be a tenth planet. One that wasn't
even planned."</p>
<p>Tyler rapped his fist against the sheet. "With a gang of clowns like
this anything could happen."</p>
<p>He jerked away the sheet and tossed it to the floor.</p>
<p>"There!" he cried. "Look here."</p>
<p>We crowded in and looked.</p>
<p>It was a cross section, or appeared to be a cross section, of a
planet.</p>
<p>"A central core," said Tyler. "An atmosphere&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Earth?"</p>
<p>"Could be. Could be Mars or Venus."</p>
<p>The sheet was covered with what could have been spec notations.</p>
<p>"It doesn't look quite right," I protested.</p>
<p>"It wouldn't if it were Mars or Venus. And how sure are you of
Earth?"</p>
<p>"Not sure at all," I said.</p>
<p>He jerked away the sheet to reveal another one.</p>
<p>We puzzled over it.</p>
<p>"Atmospheric profile," I guessed halfheartedly.</p>
<p>"These are just general specs," said Tyler. "The details will be in
some of the other rolls. We have a lot of them out there."</p>
<p>I tried to envision it. A construction shack set down in a cloud of
dust and gas. Engineers who may have worked for millennia to put
together star and planets, to key into them certain factors that still
would be at work, billions of years later.</p>
<p>Tyler said they had bungled and perhaps they had. But maybe not with
Venus. Maybe Venus had been built to different specifications. Maybe it
had been designed to be the way it was. Perhaps, a billion years from
now, when humanity might well be gone from Earth, a new life
and a new intelligence would rise on Venus.</p>
<p>Maybe not with Venus, maybe with none of the others, either. We
could not pretend to know.</p>
<p>Tyler was still going through the sheets.</p>
<p>"Look here," he was yelling. "Look here, the bunglers&#8212;"<br>
