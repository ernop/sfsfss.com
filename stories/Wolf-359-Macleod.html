<p>ere&rsquo;s a fast-paced, freewheeling, frenetic romp that
demonstrates that if life hands you lemons, make lemonade&mdash;no
matter who gets in your way or what extremes you have to go to get the
lemons <em>out</em> of it.</p>

<p>Ken Macleod graduated with a B.S. in zoology from Glasgow
Univer&shy;sity in 1976. Following research in biomechanics at
Brunei University, he worked as a computer analyst/programmer in
Edinburgh. He&rsquo;s now a full-time writer, and widely considered
to be one of the most exciting new SF writers to emerge in the
nineties, his work featuring an emphasis on politics and economics rare
in the New Space Opera, while still main&shy;taining all the
wide-screen, high-bit-rate, action-packed qualities typical of the
form. His first two novels, <em>The Star Fraction</em> and
<em>The Stone Canal,</em> each won the Prometheus Award.
His other books include the novels <em>The Sky Road, The Cassini
Division, Cosmonaut Keep, Dark Light, Engine City,</em> and <em>Newton&rsquo;s
Wake,</em> plus a novella chapbook, <em>The Human Front.</em>
His most recent books are the novel <em>Learning the World</em>
and a collection, <em>Strange Lizards from Another Galaxy.</em>
He lives in West Lothian, Scotland, with his wife and children.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re as old as I am, you&rsquo;ll find
your memory&rsquo;s not what it was. It&rsquo;s not that you <em>lose</em>
memories. That hasn&rsquo;t happened to me or anyone else since the
Paleocosmic Era, the Old Space Age, when people lived in caves on the
Moon. My trouble is that I&rsquo;ve <em>gained</em>
memories, and I don&rsquo;t know which of them are real. I was very
casual about memory storage back then, I seem to recall. This could
happen to you too, if you&rsquo;re not careful. So be warned. Do as
I say, not as I did.</p>

<p>Some of the tales about me contradict each other, or
couldn&rsquo;t possibly have happened, because that&rsquo;s how
I told them in the first place. Others I blame on the writers and
tellers. They make things up. I&rsquo;ve never done that.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;ve told stories that couldn&rsquo;t be
true, it&rsquo;s because that&rsquo;s how I remember them.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s one.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>I ran naked through the Long Station, throwing my smart
clothes away to distract the Tycoon&rsquo;s dogs. Breeks, shirt,
cravat, jacket, waistcoat, stockings, various
undergarments&mdash;one by one they ran, flapped, slithered,
danced, or scurried off, and after every one of them raced a
scent-seeking but merci&shy;fully stupid hound. But the Tycoon had
more dogs in his pack than I had clothes in my bundle. I was down to my
shoes and the baying continued. I glanced over my shoulder. Two dogs
were just ten meters behind me. I hurled a shoe at each of them,
hitting both animals right on their geneti&shy;cally modified
noses. The dogs skidded to a halt, yelping and howling. A few meters
away was a jewelry booth. I sprinted for it, vaulted the counter,
grabbed a recycler, and bashed at the display cabinet. An alarm brayed
and the security mesh rattled down behind me. The dogs, recovered and
furi&shy;ous, hurled themselves against it. The rest of the pack
pelted into view and joined them. Paws, jaws, barking, you get the
picture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put your hands up,&rdquo; said a voice above
the din.</p>

<p>I turned and looked into the bell-shaped muzzle of a Norton
held in the hands of a sweet-looking lass wearing a sample of the
stall&rsquo;s stock. I raised my hands, wishing I could put them
somewhere else. In those days, I had some vestige of modesty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m human,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;That can&rsquo;t hurt me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She allowed herself the smallest flicker of a glance at the
EMP weapon&rsquo;s sighting screen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It could give you quite a headache,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It could that,&rdquo; I admitted, my bluff
called. I&rsquo;d been half hoping she wouldn&rsquo;t know how
to interpret the readouts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Security&rsquo;s on its way,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Better them
than the dogs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave me a tight smile. &ldquo;Trouble with the
Tycoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;How did you
guess?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only the owner of the Station could afford
dogs,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Besides&hellip;&rdquo;
She blinked twice slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;Or serving girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stallkeeper laughed in my face. &ldquo;All this for a
servant? Wasn&rsquo;t it Her Ladyship&rsquo;s bedroom window
you jumped out of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shuddered. &ldquo;You flatter me,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;Anyway, how do you know about&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She blinked again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s on the gossip
channels already.&rdquo; I was about to give a heated explanation
of why <em>that</em> time-wasting rub&shy;bish
wasn&rsquo;t among the enhancements inside <em>my</em>
skull, thank you very much, when the goons turned up, sent the dogs
skulking reluctantly away, and took me in. They had the tape across my
mouth before I had a chance to ask the stallkeeper her name, let alone
her number. Not, as it turned out, that I could have done much with it
even if I had. But it would have been polite.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>The charge was attempting to willfully evade the civil
penalties for adultery. I was outraged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bastards!&rdquo; I shouted, screwing up the
indictment and dashing it to the floor of my cell. &ldquo;I thought
polygamy was illegal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said my attorney, stooping to
pick up the flimsy, &ldquo;in civilized
juris&shy;dictions.&rdquo; He smoothed it out. &ldquo;But
this is Long Station One. The Tycoon has privileges.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s barbaric,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a relic of the Moon
Caves,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>I stared at him. &ldquo;No it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember&rdquo;&mdash;I
caught myself just in time&mdash;&ldquo;reading about anything
like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tapped a slight bulge on his cranium.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it says here. Argue with the editors,
not with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I said. A second complaint
rose to the top of the stack. &ldquo;She never said anything about
being married!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ask her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That
would have been grossly impolite. In the circumstances, it would have
implied that she was contemplating adultery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; He sighed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never understand the&hellip; ethics, if
that&rsquo;s the word, of you young gallants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I smiled at that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that
doesn&rsquo;t excuse you for ignorance of the
law&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How was I to know the Tycoon was married to his
wenches?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;or custom. There is an orientation pack,
you know. All arrivals are deemed to have read it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Deemed,&rsquo;&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;Now, there&rsquo;s a word that just about sums up
every&shy;thing that&rsquo;s wrong about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can forgo counsel, if you wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I raised my hands. &ldquo;No, no. Please. Do your
best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did his best. A week later, he told me that he had got me
off with a fine plus compensation. If I borrowed money to pay the whole
sum now, it would take two hundred and fifty-seven years to pay off the
debt. I had other plans for the next two hundred and fifty-seven years.
Instead, I nego&shy;tiated a one-off advance fee to clean up Wolf
359, and used that to pay the court and the Tycoon. The experimental
civilization around Wolf 359&mdash;a limited company&mdash;had
a decade earlier gone into liquidation, taking ten billion shareholders
down with it. Nobody knew what it had turned into. Whatever remained
out there had been off limits ever since, and would be for centuries to
come&mdash;unless someone went in to clean it up.</p>

<p>In a way, the Wolf 359 situation was the polar opposite of
what the Civil Worlds had hitherto had to deal with, which was
habitats, networks, some&shy;times whole systems going into
exponential intelligence enhancement&mdash; what we called a fast
burn. We knew how to deal with a fast burn. Ignore it for five years,
and it goes away. Then send in some heavily firewalled snoop robots and
pick over the wreckage for legacy hardware. Sometimes you get a
breakout, where some of the legacy hardware reboots and starts getting
ideas above its station, but that&rsquo;s a job for the physics
team.</p>

<p>A civilizational implosion was a whole different volley of
nukes. Part of the problem was sheer nervousness. We were too close
historically to what had happened on the Moon&rsquo;s primary to be
altogether confident that we wouldn&rsquo;t somehow be sucked in
ourselves. Another part of it was simple economics: the job was too
long-term and too risky to be attractive, given all the other
opportunities available to anyone who wasn&rsquo;t completely
des&shy;perate. Into that vacancy for someone who was completely
desperate, I wish I could say I stepped. In truth, I was pushed.</p>

<p>Even I was afraid of Wolf 359.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>An Astronomical Unit is one of those measurements that should
be obsolete, but isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s no more&mdash;or
less&mdash;arbitrary than the light-year. All our units have
origins that no longer mean anything to us&mdash;we measure time by
what was originally a fraction of one axial rotation, and space by a
frac&shy;tion of the circumference, of the Moon&rsquo;s
primary. An AU was originally the distance between the Moon&rsquo;s
primary and <em>its</em> primary, the Sun. These days,
it&rsquo;s usually thought of as the approximate distance from a
G-type star to the middle of the habitable zone. About a hundred and
fifty million ki&shy;lometers.</p>

<p>The Long Tube, which the Long Station existed to shuttle
people to and from and generally to maintain, was one hundred and
eighty astronomical units long. Twenty-seven thousand million
kilometers, or, to put it in per&shy;spective, one light-day. From
the shuttle, it looked like a hairline crack in infinity, but it
didn&rsquo;t add up to a mouse&rsquo;s whisker in the Oort. It
was aimed straight at Sirius, which I could see as a bright star with a
fuzzy green haze of habitats. I shivered. I was about to be frozen,
placed with the rest of the passengers on the next needle ship out,
electromagnetically accelerated for months at 30 g to relativistic
velocities in the Long Tube, hurtled across 6.4 light-years,
decelerated in Sirius&rsquo;s matching tube, accelerated again to
Procyon, then to Talande 21185, and finally sent on a fast clipper to
Lalande&rsquo;s next-door neighbor and fellow red dwarf, Wolf 359.
It had to be a fast clip&shy;per because Wolf 359&rsquo;s Long
Tubes were no longer being calibrated&mdash;and when
you&rsquo;re aiming one Long Tube across light-years at the mouth
of an&shy;other, calibration matters.</p>

<p>A fast clipper&mdash;in fact, painfully slow, the name a
legacy of pre-Tube times, when 0.1c was a fast clip&mdash;also has
calibration issues. Pushed by laser, decelerated by laser reflection
from a mirror shell deployed on nearing the target system, it was
usually only used for seedships. This clipper was an adapted seedship,
but I was going in bulk because it was actually cheaper to thaw me out
on arrival than to grow me from a bean. If the calibration
wasn&rsquo;t quite right, I&rsquo;d never know.</p>

<p>The shuttle made minor course corrections to dock at the Long
Tube.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please pass promptly to the cryogenic
area,&rdquo; it told us.</p>

<p>I shivered again.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>Cryogenic travel has improved since then: subjectively,
it&rsquo;s pretty much in&shy;stantaneous. In those days, it
was called cold sleep, and that&rsquo;s exactly what it felt like:
being very cold and having slow, bad dreams. Even with relativistic
time dilation and a glacial metabolism, it lasted for months.</p>

<p>I woke screaming in a translucent box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, there,&rdquo; said the box.
&ldquo;Everything will be all right. Have some coffee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lid of the box extruded a nipple toward my mouth. I
screamed again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re going to be like <em>that..</em>.&rdquo;
said the box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It reminded me of a nightmare,&rdquo; I said.
My mouth was parched. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I sucked on the coffee and felt warmth spread from my belly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Update me,&rdquo; I said, around the nipple.</p>

<p>My translucent surroundings became transparent, with
explanatory text and diagrams floating like afterimages. A view, with
footnotes. This helped, but not enough. An enormous blue and white
sphere loomed right in front of me. I recoiled so hard that I hurt my
head on the back of the box.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;What the fuck is that?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;A terraformed terrestrial,&rdquo; said the box.
&ldquo;Please do try to read before reacting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I thought we
were falling toward it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; said the box.</p>

<p>I must have yelled again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Read before reacting,&rdquo; said the box.
&ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I turned my head as if to look over my shoulder. I
couldn&rsquo;t actually turn it that far, but the box obligingly
swiveled the view. The red dwarf lurked at my back, apparently closer
than the blue planet. I felt almost relieved. At least Wolf 359 was
where I expected it. According to the view&rsquo;s footnotes,
nothing else was, except the inactive Long Tubes in the wispy remnant
of the cometary cloud, twelve light-hours out. No solar-orbit microwave
stations. Not even the hulks of habitats. No asteroids. No large
cometary masses. And a planet, something that shouldn&rsquo;t have
been there, was. I didn&rsquo;t need the explanatory text to make
the connection. Every scrap of accessible mass in the system had been
thrown into this gaudy reconstruction. The planet reminded me of
pictures I&rsquo;d seen of the Moon&rsquo;s primary, back when
it had liquid water.</p>

<p>The most recent information, inevitably a decade or so out of
date, came from Lalande 21185. Watching what was going on around Wolf
359 was a tiny minority interest, but in a population of a hundred
billion, that can add up to a lot. Likewise, the diameter of
Lalande&rsquo;s habitat cloud was a good deal smaller than an
Astronomical Unit, but that still adds up to a very large virtual
telescope. Large enough to resolve the weather patterns on the planet
below me, never mind the continents. The planet&rsquo;s accretion
had begun before I set off, apparently under deliberate control, and
the terra-forming had been completed about fifty years earlier, while I
was en route. It remained raw&mdash;lots of volcanoes and
earthquakes&mdash;but habitable. There was life, obviously, but no
one knew what kind. No radio signals had been detected, nor any
evidence of intelligence, beyond some disputably artificial clusters of
lights on the night side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;Problem solved. The systems pretty much
unin&shy;habitable now, with all the mass and organics locked up in
a planet, but it may have tourist potential. No threat to anyone. Call
in a seedship. They can make something of what&rsquo;s left of the
local Kuiper belt, and get the Long Tubes back on stream. Wake me up
when it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is very much not it,&rdquo; said the box.
&ldquo;Not until we know why this happened. Not until we know
what&rsquo;s down there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, send down some probes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not have the facilities to make firewalled
snoop robots,&rdquo; said the box, &ldquo;and other probes
could be corrupted. My instructions are to deliver you to any remnant
of the Wolf 359 civilization, and that is what I shall do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It must have been an illusion, given what I could read of our
velocity, but the planet seemed to come closer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re proposing to dock&mdash;to <em>land</em>
on that object?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has an atmosphere! We&rsquo;ll burn up! And
then crash!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The remains of our propulsion system can be adapted
for aerobraking,&rdquo; said the box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would have to be <em>ridiculously</em>
finely calculated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would,&rdquo; said the box.
&ldquo;Please do not distract me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Call me sentimental, but when the box&rsquo;s Turing
functionality shut down to free up processing power for these
ridiculously fine calculations, I felt lonely. The orbital insertion
took fourteen hours. I drank hot coffee and sucked, from another
nipple, some tepid but nutritious and palatable glop. I even slept, in
my first real sleep for more than half a century. I was
awak&shy;ened by the jolt as the box spent the last of its fuel and
reaction mass on the clipper&rsquo;s final course correction. The
planet was a blue arc of atmosphere beneath me, the interstellar
propulsion plate a heat shield in front, and the deceleration shell a
still-folded drogue behind. The locations were
illu&shy;sory&mdash;relative to the clipper I was flat on my
back. The first buffeting from our passage through the upper atmosphere
coincided with an increasing sense of weight. The heat shield flared.
Red-hot air rushed past. The weight became crushing. The improvised
heat shield abraded, then exploded, its parts flicked away behind. The
drogue deployed with a bang and a jolt that almost blacked me out. The
surface became a landscape, then a land, then a wall of trees. The
clipper sliced and shuddered through them, for seconds on end of
crashes and shaking. It plowed a long furrow across green-covered soil
and halted in a cloud of smoke and steam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was a landing,&rdquo; said the box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You might have
tried to avoid the trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not,&rdquo; said the box.
&ldquo;Phytobraking was integral to my projected landing
schedule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Phytobraking,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Also, the impacted cellulose can be used to
spin you a garment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That took a few minutes. Sticky stuff oozed from the box and
hardened around me. When the uncomfortable process finished, I had a
one-piece coverall and boots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Conditions outside are tolerable,&rdquo; said
the box, &ldquo;with no immediate hazards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The box moved. The lid retracted. I saw purple sky and white
clouds above me. Resisting an unease that I later identified as
agoraphobia, I sat up. I found myself at the rear of the clippers
pointed wedge shape, about ten meters above the ground and fifty meters
from the ship&rsquo;s nose. The view was disorienting. It was like
being in a gigantic landscaped habitat, with the substrate curving the
wrong way. Wolf 359 hung in the sky like a vast red balloon, above the
straight edge of a flat violet-tinged expanse that, with some
incredulity, I recognized as an immense quantity of water. It met the
solid substrate about a kilometer away. A little to my left, an open
channel of water flowed toward the larger body. The landscape was
uneven, in parts jagged, with bare rock protruding from the vegetation
cover. The plain across which our smoking trail stretched to broken
trees was the flat&shy;test piece of ground in the vicinity. On the
horizon, I could see a range of very high ground, dominated by a
conical mass from whose truncated top smoke drifted.</p>

<p>The most unusual and encouraging feature of the landscape,
however, was the score or so of plainly artificial and metallic gnarly
lumps scattered across it. The system had had at least a million
habitats in its heyday; these were some of their wrecks. Smoke rose
from most of them, including the nearest, which stuck up about twenty
meters from the ground, about fifteen hundred meters away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can talk to my head?&rdquo; I asked the
ship. &ldquo;You can see what I see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; it said, in my head.</p>

<p>I climbed down and struck out across the rough ground.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>I was picking my way along a narrow watercourse between two
precipices of moss-covered rock when I heard a sound ahead of me, and
looked up. At the exit from the defile, I saw three men, each sitting
on the back of a large animal and holding what looked like a pointed
stick. Their hair was long, their skin bare except where it was draped
with the hairy skin of some different animal. I raised one hand and
stepped forward. The men bristled instantly, aiming their sharp sticks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come forward slowly,&rdquo; one of them shouted.</p>

<p>Pleased that they had not lost speech along with civilization,
I complied. The three men glowered down at me. The big beasts made
noises in their noses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are from the spaceship,&rdquo; said one of
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have waited long for this,&rdquo; the man
said. &ldquo;Come with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all turned their mounts about and headed back toward the
habitat hulk, which I could now see clearly. It was surrounded by much
smaller arti&shy;ficial structures, perhaps twenty in all, and by
rectangular patches of ground within which plants grew in rows. No one
offered a ride, to my relief. As we drew closer, small children ran out
to meet us, yelling and laughing, tugging at my coverall. Closer still,
I saw women stooped among the ordered rows of plants, rearranging the
substrate with hand tools. The smells of decayed plant matter and of
animal and human ordure invaded and occupied my nostrils. Within the
settlement itself, most entrances had a person sitting in front. They
watched me pass with no sign of curiosity. Some were male, some female,
all with shriveled skin, missing or rotting teeth, and discolored hair.
The ship whispered what had happened to them. I was still fighting down
the dry heaves when we arrived in front of the hulk. Scorched, rusted,
eroded, it nevertheless looked utterly alien to the shelters of stone
and plant material that surrounded it. It was difficult to believe it
had been made by the same species. In front of what had once been an
airlock, the rest of the young and mature men of the village had
gathered.</p>

<p>A tall man, made taller by a curious cylindrical arrangement
of animal skins on his head, stepped forward and raised a hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome to the new E&mdash;,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>As soon as he spoke the taboo word for the Moon&rsquo;s
primary, I realized the terrible thing that had happened here, and the
worse thing that would happen. My mind almost froze with horror. I
forced myself to remain stand&shy;ing, to smile&mdash;no doubt
sickly&mdash;and to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I greet you from the Civil Worlds,&rdquo; I
said.</p>

<p>In the feast that followed, the men talked for hours. My
digestive and immune systems coped well with what the people gave me to
eat and drink. On my way back to the ship that evening, as soon as I
was out of sight, I spewed the lot. But it was what my mind had
assimilated that made me sick, and sent me back sorry to the ship.</p>

<p>* * * *</p>

<p>The largest political unit that ever existed encompassed ten
billion people, and killed them. Not intentionally, but the runaway
snowball effect that iced over the planet can without doubt be blamed
on certain of the World State&rsquo;s well-intended policies. The
lesson was well taken, in the Civil Worlds. The founders of the Wolf
359 settlement corporation thought they had found a way around it, and
built a single system-wide association free of the many inconveniences
of the arrangements prevalent elsewhere. A limited com&shy;pany,
even with ten billion shareholders, would surely not have the same
fatal flaws as a government! They were wrong.</p>

<p>It began as a boardroom dispute. One of the directors appealed
to the shareholders. The shareholders formed voting blocs, a management
buyout was attempted, a hostile takeover solicited from an upstart
venture capital fund around Lalande; a legal challenge to <em>that</em>
was mounted before the in&shy;vitation had gone a light-minute;
somebody finagled an obscure financial instrument into an AI with
shareholding rights; several fund management AIs formed a consortium to
object to this degrading precedent, and after that there began some
serious breakdowns in communication. That last isn&rsquo;t an irony
or a euphemism: in a system-wide unit, sheer misunderstanding can
result in megadeaths, and here it did. The actual shooting, however
hor&shy;rendous, was only the coup de grace.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the downward spiral, with grief, hate, and
recrimina&shy;tion crowding what communication there was, someone
came up with an idea that could only have appealed to people driven
half mad. That was to finally solve the coordination problem whose
answer had eluded everyone up to and including the company&rsquo;s
founders, by starting social evolution all over again: to build a new
planet in the image of the old home planet, and settle it with people
whose genes had been reset to the default human base&shy;line. That
meant, of course, dooming them and their offspring to death by
deterioration within decades. But when did such a consideration ever
stop fanatics? And among the dwindling, desperate millions who remained
in the orbiting wreckage and continuing welter, there were more than
enough fanatics to be found. Some of them still lived, in the doorways
of huts. Their offspring were no less fanatical, and more deluded. They
seemed to think the Civil Worlds awaited with interest the insights
they&rsquo;d attained in a couple of short-lived generations of
tribal warfare. The men did, anyway. The women were too busy in the
vegetation patches and elsewhere to think about such matters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The project had a certain elegance,&rdquo;
mused the ship, as we discussed it far into the night. &ldquo;To
use evolution itself in an attempt to supersede it&hellip;And even
if it didn&rsquo;t accomplish that, it could produce something new.
The tril&shy;lions of human beings of the Civil Worlds are
descended from a founding population of a few thousands, and are thus
constrained by the founder effect. Your extended life spans further
lock you in. You live within biological and social limits that you are
unable to see because of those very limits. This experiment has the
undoubted potential of reshuffling the deck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me why this was such a great
idea!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Tell me what response you expect
from the Civil Worlds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some variant of a fear response has a much higher
probability than a compassionate response,&rdquo; said the ship.
&ldquo;This planetary experiment will be seen as an attempt to work
around accidental but beneficial effects of the bottleneck humanity
passed through in the Moon Caves, to emerge in polyarchy. The
probability of harm resulting from any genetic or memetic mutation that
would enable the founding of successful states on a system-wide
scale&mdash;or wider&mdash;is vastly greater than the benefits
from the quality-adjusted life-years of the planet&rsquo;s
population. And simply to leave this planet alone would in the best
case lay the basis for a future catastro&shy;phe engulfing a much
larger population, or, in the worst case, allow it to become an
interstellar power&mdash;which would, on the assumptions of most
people, result in catastrophes on a yet greater scale. The moral
calculation is straightforward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;And <em>our</em> moral calculation, I suppose,
is to decide whether to report back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That decision has been made,&rdquo; said the
ship. &ldquo;I left some microsatellites in orbit, which have
already relayed our discoveries to the still-functioning transmitters
on the systems Long Station.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I cursed ineffectually for a while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have we got?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ship took an uncharacteristic few seconds to answer.
&ldquo;That depends on where and when the decision is made. The
absolute minimum time is at least a decade, allowing for transmission
time to Lalande, and assuming an immediate decision to launch
relativistic weapons, using their Long Tubes as guns. More realistic
estimates, allowing for discussion, and the decision&rsquo;s being
referred to one of the larger and more distant civilizations, give a
median time of around five decades. I would expect longer, given the
grav&shy;ity of the decision and the lack of urgency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give them some reason for urgency.
You&rsquo;ve just re&shy;minded me that there&rsquo;s a
Long Tube in <em>this</em> system, not calibrated to take
or send to or from other Tubes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fail to see the relevance,&rdquo; said the
ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will,&rdquo; I told it. &ldquo;You
will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following morning, I walked back to the settlement, and
talked with the young men for a long time. When I returned to the ship,
I was riding, most uncomfortably, on the back of an animal. I told the
ship what I wanted. The ship was outraged, but like all seedship AIs,
it was strongly constrained. (Nobody wants to seed a system with a fast
burn.) The ship did what it was told.</p>

<p>Two years later, Belated Meteor Impact, the tall young man
who&rsquo;d greeted me, was king of an area of several thousand
square kilometers. The seedship&rsquo;s bootstrapped nanofactories
were turning substrate into weapons and tools, and vegetation cellulose
into clothes and other goods for trade. A laser launcher to send
second-generation seedships into the sky was under construction. A year
later, the first of them shot skyward. Five years later, some of these
ships reached the remnant cometary cloud and the derelict Long Station.
Ten years after I&rsquo;d arrived, we had a space elevator. Belated
Meteor Impact ruled the continent and his fleets were raiding the other
continents&rsquo; coasts. Another five years, and we had most of
the population of New Earth up the elevator and into orbital habitats.
Our Long Tube was being moved frequently and unpredictably, with
profligate use of reac&shy;tion mass. By the time the relativistic
weapon from Procyon smashed New Earth, thirty-seven years after my
arrival, we were ready to make good use of the fragments to build more
habitats, and more ships.</p>

<p>My Space Admiral, Belated Meteor Impact II, was ready too,
with what we now called the Long Gun. Lalande capitulated at once, Ross
128 after a demonstration of the Long Gun&rsquo;s power. Procyon
took longer to fall. Sirius sued for peace, as did the Solar System,
whereupon we turned our attention outward, to the younger
civilizations, such as your own. We now conquer with emissaries, rather
than ships and weapons, but the ships and the Long Guns are there. You
may be sure of that. As an emissary of the Empire, I give you my word.</p>

<p>As for myself, I was the last survivor of the government of
Earth, a minor functionary stranded on the Moon during a routine
fact-finding mission when the sudden onset of climate catastrophe froze
all life on the primary. How I survived in the anarchy that followed is
a long story, and another story. You may not have heard it, but that
hardly matters.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll have heard of me.</p>
