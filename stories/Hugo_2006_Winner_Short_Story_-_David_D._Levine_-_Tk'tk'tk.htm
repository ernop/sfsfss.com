Levine&rsquo;s tale of a distraught salesman light years from home
is his first story for Asimov&rsquo;s.</i></p>

<p>Walker&rsquo;s voice recorder was a beautiful thing
of aluminum and plastic, hard and crisp and rectangular. It sat on the
waxy countertop, surrounded by the lumpy excreted-looking products of
the local technology. <i>Unique selling proposition,</i>
he thought, and clutched the leather handle of his
grandfather&rsquo;s briefcase as though it were a talisman.</p>

<p><i>Shkthh pth kstphst,</i> the shopkeeper
said, and Walker&rsquo;s hypno-implanted vocabulary provided a
translation: &ldquo;What a delightful object.&rdquo; Chitinous
fingers picked up the recorder, scrabbling against the aluminum case
with a sound that Walker found deeply disturbing. &ldquo;What does
it do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took him a moment to formulate a reply. Even with
hypno, <i> Thfshpfth</i> was a formidably complex
language. &ldquo;It listens and repeats,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You talk all day, it remembers all. Earth technology.
Nothing like it for light-years.&rdquo; The word for
&ldquo;light-year&rdquo; was <i>hkshkhthskht,</i>
difficult to pronounce. He hoped he&rsquo;d gotten it right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed yes, most unusual.&rdquo; The pink
frills, or gills, at the sides of the alien&rsquo;s head throbbed.
It did not look down&mdash;its faceted eyes and neckless head made
that impossible&mdash;but Walker judged its attention was on the
recorder and not on himself. Still, he kept smiling and kept looking
the alien in the eyes with what he hoped would be interpreted as a
sincere expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such a unique object must surely be beyond
the means of such a humble one as myself,&rdquo; the proprietor
said at last. <i>Sthshsk, </i> such-a-humble-
one-as-myself&mdash;Walker could die a happy man if he never heard
those syllables again.</p>

<p><i>Focus on value, not price.</i>
&ldquo;Think how useful,&rdquo; he hissed in reply.
&ldquo;Never forget things again.&rdquo; He wasn&rsquo;t
sure you could use <i>htpthtk, </i>&ldquo;things,&rdquo;
in that way, but he hoped it got the point across.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the honored visitor might wish to
partake of a cup of <i> thshsh?</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walker&rsquo;s smile became rigid. <i>Thshsh</i>
was a beverage nearly indistinguishable from warm piss. But
he&rsquo;d learned that to turn down an offer of food or drink
would bring negotiations to an abrupt close.
&ldquo;This-humble-one-accepts-your-most-generous-offer,&rdquo;
he said, letting the memorized syllables flow over his tongue.</p>

<p>He examined the shopkeeper&rsquo;s stock as it
prepared the drink. It all looked like the products of a sixth-grade
pottery class, irregular clots of brown and gray. But the
aliens&rsquo; biotech was far beyond
Earth&rsquo;s&mdash;some of these lumps would be worth
thousands back home. Too bad he had no idea which ones. His expertise
lay elsewhere, and he was here to sell, not buy.</p>

<p>The shopkeeper itself was a little smaller than most of
its kind, about a hundred forty centimeters tall, mostly black, with
yellow spine-tips and green eyes. Despite its insectile appearance, it
was warm-blooded&mdash;under its chitin it had bones and muscle and
organs not unlike Walker&rsquo;s own. But its mind and culture were
even stranger than its disturbing mouth- parts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cup of friendship,&rdquo; the alien
said, offering a steaming cup of <i>thshsh</i>. Walker
suppressed a shudder as his fingers touched the
alien&rsquo;s&mdash;warm, covered with fine hairs, and slightly
sticky&mdash;but he nodded politely and raised the cup to his lips.</p>

<p>He sipped as little as he felt he could politely get
away with. It was still vile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Forty-five minutes later the conversation finally
returned to the voice recorder. &ldquo;Ownership of this most
wondrous object is surely beyond price. Perhaps the honored guest would
be willing to lend it for a short period?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No trial period necessary. Satisfaction is
guaranteed.&rdquo; He was taking a risk with that, he knew, but the
recorder had never failed him in all the years he&rsquo;d owned it.</p>

<p><i>Tk&rsquo;tk&rsquo;tk,</i> the
alien said, tapping its mouthparts together. There was no translation
for that in Walker&rsquo;s vocabulary. He wanted to throttle the
thing&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t it even stick to its own
language?&mdash;but he struggled not to show his impatience.</p>

<p>After a pause, the alien spread a hand&mdash;a
gesture that meant nothing to Walker. &ldquo;Perhaps the honored
owner could be compensated for the temporary use of the
property.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humbly requesting more details.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A loan of this type is generally for an
indefinite period. The compensation is, of course, subject to
negotiation. . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You make offer?&rdquo; he interrupted. He
realized that he was not being as polite as he could be. But it was
already late afternoon, and he hadn&rsquo;t eaten since
breakfast&mdash;and if he didn&rsquo;t conclude this deal
successfully he might not have enough money for lunch.</p>

<p><i>Tk&rsquo;tk&rsquo;tk</i> again.
&ldquo;Forty-three,&rdquo; it said at last.</p>

<p>Walker seethed at the offer. He had hoped to sell the
recorder for enough to live on for at least a week, and his hotel
alone&mdash;barely worthy of the name&mdash;cost twenty-seven a
night. But he had already spent most of a day trying to raise some
cash, and this was the only concrete offer he&rsquo;d gotten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seventy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The alien&rsquo;s gills, normally in constant slight
motion, stopped. Walker knew he had offended it somehow, and his heart
sank. But his smile never wavered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seventy is a very inopportune number. To
offer seventy to one of your exalted status would be a great
insult.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Damn these aliens and their obscure numerology! Walker
began to sputter an apology.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seventy-three, on the other hand,&rdquo;
the shopkeeper continued, &ldquo;is a number with an impeccable
lineage. Would the honored guest accept compensation in this
amount?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was so busy trying to apologize that he almost
didn&rsquo;t recognize the counter-offer for what it was. But some
salesman&rsquo;s instinct, some fragment of his father&rsquo;s
and his grandfather&rsquo;s DNA, noticed it, and he managed to hiss
out
&ldquo;This-humble-one-accepts-your-most-generous-offer&rdquo;
before he got in any more trouble.</p>

<p>It took another hour before the shopkeeper actually
counted the money&mdash;soft brown lumps like rabbit droppings,
each looking exactly like the others&mdash;into Walker&rsquo;s
hand. He passed his reader over them; it smelled the lumps and told him
they were three seventeens, two nines, and a four, totaling
seventy-three as promised. He sorted them into different pockets so he
wouldn&rsquo;t accidentally give the luggage-carrier a
week&rsquo;s salary as a tip again. It angered him to be dependent
on the Chokasti-made reader, but he would rather use alien technology
than try to read the aliens&rsquo; acrid pheromonal
&ldquo;writing&rdquo; with his own nose.</p>

<p>Walker pressed through the labia of the shop entrance
into the heat and noise and stink of the street. Hard orange shafts of
dusty late-afternoon sun glinted dully on the scuttling carapaces of
the populace: little merchants and bureaucrats, big laborers and
warriors, hulking mindless transporters. No cars, no autoplanes . . .
just a rustling mass of aliens, chuttering endlessly in their harsh
sibilant language, scraping their hard spiny limbs and bodies against
each other and the rounded, gourd-like walls. Here and there a knot of
two or three in conversation blocked traffic, which simply clambered
over them. The aliens had no concept of personal space.</p>

<p>Once a swarm of juveniles had crawled right over <i>him</i>&mdash;a
nightmare of jointed legs and chitinous bodies, and a bitter smell like
rusty swamp water. They had knocked his briefcase from his hand, and he
had scrambled after it under the scrabbling press of their bodies. He
shuddered at the memory&mdash;not only did the briefcase contain
his most important papers, it had belonged to his grandfather. His
father had given it to him when he graduated from college.</p>

<p>He clutched his jacket tight at his throat, gripped his
briefcase firmly under his arm, and shouldered through the crowd.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Walker sat in the waiting room of his most promising
prospect&mdash;to be blunt, his <i>only</i>
prospect&mdash;a manufacturer of building supplies whose name
translated as Amber Stone. Five days in transit, eight weeks in this
bug-infested hellhole of a city, a fifteen-megabyte database of
contacts from five different species, and all he had to show for it was
one lousy stinking customer. <i> Potential</i> customer at
that . . . it hadn&rsquo;t signed anything yet. But Walker had been
meeting with it every couple of days for two weeks, and he was sure he
was right on the edge of a very substantial sale. All he had to do was
keep himself on site and on message.</p>

<p>The light in the palm-sized windows shaded from orange
to red before Amber Stone finally appeared from its inner office.
&ldquo;Ah, human! So very pleased that you honor such a humble one
as myself with your delightful presence.&rdquo; The aliens
couldn&rsquo;t manage the name &ldquo;Walker,&rdquo; and
even &ldquo;human&rdquo; came out more like <i>hsshp&rsquo;k</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honor is mine, Amber Stone. You read
information I give you, three days?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most intriguing, yes. Surely no finer
literature has ever been produced.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have questions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Questions it did have, yes indeed, no end of
questions&mdash;who performed the translation, where did you have
it reproduced, is it really as cold there as they say, did you come
through Pthshksthpt or by way of Sthktpth . . . but no questions about
the product. <i> I&rsquo;m building rapport with the
customer,</i> Walker thought grimly, and kept up his end of the
conversation as best he could.</p>

<p>Finally Walker tried to regain control. &ldquo;Your
business, it goes well?&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Tk&rsquo;tk&rsquo;tk,</i> the
customer said, and placed its hands on its shoulders. &ldquo;As the
most excellent guest must surely have noticed, the days are growing
longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walker had no idea what that might mean. &ldquo;Good
business or bad, always need for greater efficiency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The honored visitor graces this humble one
with the benefits of a unique perspective.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though the sweat ran down behind his tie, Walker felt as
though he were sliding on ice&mdash;his words refusing to gain
traction. &ldquo;My company&rsquo;s software will improve
inventory management efficiency and throughput by three hundred percent
or more,&rdquo; he said, pulling out one of his best memorized
phrases.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, your most marvelous software is surely
so far superior to our humble computers that no accommodation could be
made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We offer complete solution. Hardware,
software, support. Fully compatible. Satisfaction
guaranteed.&rdquo; Walker smiled, trying to project
confidence&mdash;no, not just confidence, <i>love,</i>
for the product.</p>

<p><i>Tk&rsquo;tk&rsquo;tk</i>. Was
that an expression of interest? &ldquo;Most intriguing, yes. Most
unique. Alas, sun is setting.&rdquo; It gestured to the windows,
which had faded from red to nearly black. &ldquo;This most humble
one must beg the honored visitor&rsquo;s forgiveness for consuming
so much valuable time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is no problem. . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This one would not dream of insulting an
honored guest in such a way. Please take your rest now, and honor this
unworthy establishment with your esteemed presence again
tomorrow.&rdquo; The alien turned and vanished into the inner
office.</p>

<p>Walker sat and seethed. <i>Dismissed by a bug,</i>
he thought, <i> how much lower can you sink?</i> He stared
into the scuffed leather surface of his briefcase as though
he&rsquo;d find the answer there. But it just sat on his lap,
pressing down with the hard-edged weight of two generations of
successful salesmen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though the sun had set, the street was still
oppressively hot and still teemed with aliens. The yellow-green
bioluminescent lighting made them look even stranger, more unnatural.
Walker clutched his grandfather&rsquo;s briefcase to his chest as
the malodorous crowd bumped and jostled him, spines catching on his
clothing and hair.</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t help his attitude that he was
starving. He&rsquo;d left most of his lunch on the plate, unable to
stomach more than a few wriggling bites, and that had been hours ago.
He hoped he&rsquo;d be able to find something more palatable for
dinner, but he wasn&rsquo;t very optimistic. It seemed so cruel of
the universe to make travelers find food when they were hungry.</p>

<p>But then, drifting between the sour and acrid smells of
the bustling street, Walker&rsquo;s nose detected a warm,
comforting smell, something like baked potatoes. He wandered up and
down the street, passing his reader over pheromone-lines on the walls
advertising SUPERLATIVE CHITIN-WAX and BLUE RIVER MOLT-FEVER INSURANCE.
Finally, just as he was coming to the conclusion the smell was a trick
of his homesick mind, the reader&rsquo;s tiny screen told him he
had arrived at the SPIRIT OF LIFE VEGETARIAN RESTAURANT.</p>

<p>He hadn&rsquo;t even known the <i>Thfshpfth</i>
language had the concept &ldquo;vegetarian.&rdquo; But whatever
it was, it certainly smelled good. He pushed through the
restaurant&rsquo;s labia.</p>

<p>The place was tiny and low-ceilinged, with a single low,
curving counter and five squatting-posts. Only one of the posts was
occupied, by a small brown alien with white spine-tips and red eyes. It
sat quietly, hands folded on the counter, in an attitude that struck
Walker as contemplative. No staff was in evidence.</p>

<p>Walker chose a post, placed his folded jacket on it as a
cushion, and seated himself as comfortably as possible. His space at
the counter had the usual indentation, into which his order would be
ladled, and was equipped with a double-ended spoon, an ice-pick, a
twisty implement whose use he had yet to decipher, and a small bowl of
water (which, he had learned to his great embarrassment, was for
washing the fingertips, not drinking). But there was no menu.</p>

<p>Menus were one of the most frustrating things about this
planet. Most of the items listed on the pheromone-tracked planks were
not in his reader&rsquo;s vocabulary, and for the rest the
translations were inadequate&mdash;how was he supposed to know
whether or not &ldquo;land-crab in the northern style&rdquo;
was something he would find edible? Time and again he had gone hungry,
offended the server, or both. Even so, menus were something he
understood. He had no idea what to order, or even how, without a menu
to point at.</p>

<p>He drummed his fingers on the countertop and fidgeted
while he waited for the server to appear. Say what you like about these
creatures, they were unfailingly polite, and prompt. Usually. But not
here, apparently. Finally, frustrated, he got up to leave. But as he
was putting on his jacket, trying to steel himself for the crowd
outside, he caught another whiff of that baked-potato smell. He turned
back to the other customer, still sitting quietly. &ldquo;No menu.
No server. Hungry. How order?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The alien did not turn. &ldquo;Sit quietly. With
peace comes fulfillment.&rdquo; Its voice was a low susurration,
not as harsh as most of the others he&rsquo;d heard.</p>

<p>With peace comes fulfillment? Walker opened his mouth
for a sarcastic reply, but found his grammar wasn&rsquo;t up to the
task. And he was hungry. And the food smelled good. So he took off his
jacket and sat down again.</p>

<p>He sat with back straight and hands folded, staring at
the swirled brown and cream colors of the wall in front of him. It
might have come from Amber Stone&rsquo;s factory, produced by a
huge genetically modified life form that ate garbage and shat building
supplies. He tried not to think about it too much . . . the
aliens&rsquo; biotechnology made him queasy.</p>

<p>Looking at the wall, he thought about what it would take
to sell Amber Stone&rsquo;s products on Earth. They
couldn&rsquo;t be any more incomprehensible to him than the
software he had been sent here to sell, and as his father always said,
&ldquo;a good salesman can sell anything.&rdquo; Though with
three failed jobs and a failed marriage behind him, he was no longer
sure that description had ever really fit him. No matter, he was too
old to change careers now. The most he could hope for now was to stay
alive until he could afford to retire. Get off the treadmill, buy a
little house in the woods, walk the dog, maybe go fishing. . . .</p>

<p>Walker&rsquo;s reverie was interrupted when the
other customer rose from its squatting-post and walked around the
counter to stand in front of him. &ldquo;Greetings,&rdquo; it
said. &ldquo;This one welcomes the peaceful visitor to the Spirit
of Life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walker sputtered. &ldquo;You . . . you
server?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All serve the Spirit of Life, well or poorly,
whether they understand it or not. This one serves food as well. The
visitor is hungry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Walker&rsquo;s head
throbbed. Was the alien laughing at him?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then this one will bring food. When peace is
attained, satisfaction follows.&rdquo; It vanished through the door
behind the counter.</p>

<p>Walker fumed, but he tried to wait peacefully. Soon the
alien returned with a steaming pot, and ladled out a portion into the
indentation in front of Walker. It looked like chunks of purple carrot
and pale-yellow potato in a saffron-colored sauce, and it smelled
wonderful. It tasted wonderful, too. A little strange,
maybe&mdash;the purple carrots were bitter and left an odd
aftertaste&mdash;but it had a complex flavor and was warm and
filling. Walker spooned up every bit of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; he said to the server,
which had returned to its previous station in front of the counter.
&ldquo;How much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It spread its hands and said &ldquo;This
establishment serves the Spirit of Life. Any donation would be
appropriate.&rdquo; It pointed to a glass jar on the counter, which
contained a small pile of money.</p>

<p>Walker considered. How much of his limited funds could
he spare? Yesterday&rsquo;s lunch had cost him five and a half.
This place, and the food, were much plainer. But it was the single best
meal he had eaten in weeks. Finally he chose a seven from his pocket,
scanned it with his reader to make sure, and dropped it in the jar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This one thanks the peaceful guest. Please
return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walker gave an awkward little bow, then pushed through
the restaurant&rsquo;s labia into the nightmare of the street.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Walker waved his room key, a twisted brown stick reeking
with complex pheromones, at the hotel desk clerk. &ldquo;Key no
work,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No let me in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clerk took the key, ran its fingers over it to read
the codes. &ldquo;Ah. Yes. This most humble one must apologize. <i>Fthshpk
</i> starts tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is <i>Fthshpk?</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah. Yes. This humble one has been so unkind
as to forget that the most excellent guest is not familiar with the
poor customs of this humble locale. <i>Fthshpk</i> is a
religious political holiday. A small and insignificant celebration by
our guest&rsquo;s most elevated standards, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So why it not work, the key?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humble though it may be, <i>Fthshpk</i>
is very important to the poor folk of the outlying regions. They come
to the city in great numbers. This humble room has long been promised
to such as these. And surely the most honored guest does not wish to
share it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. . . .&rdquo; The room was tiny enough
for Walker alone. And he didn&rsquo;t want to find out how some of
the equipment in the toilet-room was used.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed. So this most humble establishment, in
a poor attempt to satisfy the most excellent human guest, has moved the
guest&rsquo;s belongings to another room.&rdquo; It held out a
new key, identical in appearance to the old one.</p>

<p>Walker took the key. &ldquo;Where is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three levels down. Most cozy and
well-protected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The new room was larger than the old one, having two
separate antechambers of unknown function. But the rounded ceiling was
terribly low&mdash;though Walker could stand up straight in the
middle of the room, he had to crouch everywhere else&mdash;and the
lighting was dim, the heat and humidity desperately oppressive, and
everything in the room stank of the aliens.</p>

<p>He lay awake for hours, staring into the sweltering
darkness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the morning, he discovered that his shaver and some
other things had vanished in the move. When he complained at the front
desk, he got nothing but effusive, meaningless praise&mdash;oh yes,
the most wonderful guest must be correct, our criminal staff is surely
at fault&mdash;and a bill for the previous night&rsquo;s stay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three hundred eighty-three!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The usual <i>Fthshpk</i> rate
for our highest-quality suite is five hundred sixty-one. This most
inadequate establishment has already offered a substantial reduction,
out of respect for the highly esteemed guest and the unfortunate
circumstances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Highest-quality suite? Too hot! Too dark! Too
low!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah. Yes. The most excellent guest has unique
tastes. Alas, this poor room is considered the most preferential in the
hotel. The heat and light are praised by our other, sadly
unenlightened, customers. These most lowly ones find it
comforting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I not have so much money. You take
interstellar credit? Bank draft?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clerk&rsquo;s gills stopped pulsing and it drew
back a step, going <i>tk&rsquo;tk&rsquo;tk</i>.
&ldquo;Surely this humble one has misheard the most honored guest,
for to offer credit during <i>Fthshpk</i> would be a most
grave insult.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walker licked his lips. Though the lobby was sweltering
hot, suddenly he felt chilled. &ldquo;Can pay after
holiday?&rdquo; He would have to find some other source of local
currency.</p>

<p><i>Tk&rsquo;tk&rsquo;tk</i>.
&ldquo;If the most honored visitor will please be patient. . .
.&rdquo; The clerk vanished.</p>

<p>Walker talked with the front desk manager, the chief
hotelier, and the <i>thkfsh,</i> whatever that was, but
behind the miasma of extravagant politeness was a cold hard wall of
fact: he would pay for the room, he would pay in cash, and he would pay
now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This establishment extends its most sincere
apologies for the honored guest&rsquo;s unfortunate
situation,&rdquo; said the <i>thkfsh,</i> which was
dark yellow with green spine-tips and eyes. &ldquo;However, even in
this most humble city, payment for services rendered is required by
both custom and law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walker had already suffered from the best the city had
to offer&mdash;he was terrified of what he might find in the local
jail. &ldquo;I no have enough money. What can I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the most honored guest would consider
temporarily lending some personal possessions to the hotel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walker remembered how he had sold his voice recorder.
&ldquo;Lend? For indefinite period?&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Tk&rsquo;tk&rsquo;tk</i>.
&ldquo;The honored guest is most direct and forthright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walker thought about what they might want that he could
spare. Not his phone, or his reader. &ldquo;Interest in clothes?
Shoes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The highly perceptive guest will no doubt
have noticed that the benighted residents of this city have not yet
learned to cover themselves in this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walker sighed, and opened his briefcase. Mostly papers,
worthless or confidential or both. &ldquo;Paper fastening
device,&rdquo; he said, holding up his stapler. &ldquo;Earth
technology. Nothing like it for sixty-five light years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely such an item is unique and
irreplaceable,&rdquo; said the <i> thkfsh</i>.
&ldquo;To accept the loan of this fine device would bring shame
upon this humble establishment. However, the traveling-box . .
.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not understanding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i>thkfsh</i> touched the scuffed
leather of Walker&rsquo;s briefcase. &ldquo;This traveling-box.
It is most finely made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walker&rsquo;s chest tightened. &ldquo;This
humble object . . . only a box. Not worth anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The surface has a most unusual and sublime
flavor. And the texture is unlike anything this unworthy one has
touched.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Desperately, Walker dug under papers for something,
anything else. He found a pocket umbrella. &ldquo;This, folding
rain-shield. Most useful. Same technology used in expanding solar
panels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The honored visitor&rsquo;s government
would surely object to the loan of such sensitive technology. But the
traveling-box is, as the visitor says, only a box. Its value and
interest to such a humble one as myself are far greater than its value
to the exalted guest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walker&rsquo;s fingernails bit into his palms.
&ldquo;Box has . . . personal value. Egg-parent&rsquo;s
egg-parent used it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How delightful! For the temporary loan of
such a fine and significant object, this establishment might be willing
to forgive the most worthy visitor&rsquo;s entire debt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s only a briefcase, Walker thought.
It&rsquo;s not worth going to jail for. But his eyes stung as he
emptied it out and placed its contents in a cheap extruded carry-bag.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unshaven, red-eyed, Walker left the hotel carrying all
his remaining possessions: a suitcase full of clothes and the
carry-bag. He had less than a hundred in cash in his pockets, and no
place to spend the night.</p>

<p>Harsh sunlight speared into his eyes from a flat blue
sky. Even at this hour of the morning, the heat was already enough to
make sweat spring from his skin. And the streets swarmed with
aliens&mdash;more of them, in greater variety, and more excited
than he had ever seen before.</p>

<p>A group of five red-and-black laborers, each over two
and a half meters tall, waded through the crowd singing&mdash;or at
least chattering rhythmically in unison. A swarm of black juveniles
crawled over them in the opposite direction, flinging handfuls of
glittering green rings into the air. All around, aliens large and small
spun in circles, waving their hands in the air. Some pounded drums or
wheedled on high-pitched flutes.</p>

<p>A yellow merchant with black spines grabbed
Walker&rsquo;s elbows and began spinning the two of them around,
colliding with walls and with other members of the crowd. The merchant
chattered happily as they spun, but its words were lost in the
maelstrom of sound that surrounded them. &ldquo;Let go! Let
go!&rdquo; Walker shouted, clutching his suitcase and his bag as he
tried to squirm away, but the merchant couldn&rsquo;t
hear&mdash;or wasn&rsquo;t listening&mdash;and its
chitinous hands were terribly strong.</p>

<p>Finally Walker managed to twist out of the
merchant&rsquo;s grasp, only to spin away and collide with one of
the hulking laborers. Its unyielding spines tore Walker&rsquo;s
jacket.</p>

<p>The laborer stopped chanting and turned to face Walker.
It grasped his shoulders, turned him side to side. &ldquo;What are
you?&rdquo; it shouted. Its breath was fetid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Visitor from Earth,&rdquo; Walker shouted
back, barely able to hear himself.</p>

<p>The laborer called to its companions, which had moved on
through the crowd. They fought their way back, and the five of them
stood around him, completely blocking the light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This one is a visitor from <i>h&rsquo;th,</i>&rdquo;
said the first laborer.</p>

<p>One of the others grabbed a handful of green rings from
a passing juvenile, scattered them over Walker&rsquo;s head and
shoulders. They watched him expectantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you?&rdquo; he said. But that
didn&rsquo;t seem to be what they wanted.</p>

<p>The first laborer cuffed Walker on the shoulder, sending
him reeling into one of the others. &ldquo;The visitor is not very
polite,&rdquo; it said. The aliens loomed close around him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This-most-humble-one-begs-the-honored-one&rsquo;s-forgiveness,&rdquo;
Walker chattered out, clutching the carry-bag to his chest, wishing for
the lost solidity of his grandfather&rsquo;s briefcase. But the
laborers ignored his apology and began to twirl him around, shouting in
unison.</p>

<p>After a few dozen spins he made out the words of the
chant: &ldquo;Rings, dance! Rings, dance!&rdquo; Desperately,
not at all sure he was doing the right thing, he tried to dance in
circles as he had seen some of the aliens do.</p>

<p>The laborers pulled the bag from Walker&rsquo;s
hands and began to stomp their feet. &ldquo;Rings, dance! Rings,
dance!&rdquo; Walker waved his arms in the air as he spun, chanting
along with them. His breath came in short pants, destroying his
pronunciation.</p>

<p>He twirled, gasping &ldquo;rings, dance,&rdquo;
until he felt the hot sun on his head, and twirled a while longer until
he understood what that sun meant: the laborers, and their shade, had
deserted him. He was spinning for no reason, in the middle of a crowd
that took no notice. He stopped turning and dropped his arms, weaving
with dizziness and relief. But the relief lasted only a
moment&mdash;sudden panic seized him as he realized his arms were
empty.</p>

<p>There was the carry-bag, just a meter away, lying in the
dirt surrounded by chitinous alien feet. He plowed through the crowd
and grabbed it before it got too badly stomped.</p>

<p>But though he searched for an hour, he never found the
suitcase.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Walker leaned, panting, against the outside wall of
Amber Stone&rsquo;s factory. He had fought through the surging
streets for hours, hugging the bag to his chest under his tightly
buttoned jacket, to reach this point. Again and again he had been
sprinkled with green rings and had danced in circles, feeling
ridiculous, but not wanting to find out what might happen if he
refused. He was hot and sweaty and filthy.</p>

<p>The still-damp pheromone line drawn across the
office&rsquo;s labia read CLOSED FOR <i>FTHSHPK</i>.</p>

<p>Walker covered his face with his hands. Sobs thick as
glue clogged the back of his throat, and he stood with shoulders
heaving, not allowing himself to make a sound. The holiday crowd
streamed past like a river of blackberry vines.</p>

<p>Eventually he recovered his composure and blew his nose,
patting his waist as he pocketed the sodden handkerchief. His money
belt, with the two hard little rectangles of his passport and return
ticket, was still in place. All he had to do was walk to the transit
gate, and he could return home&mdash;with nothing to show for his
appallingly expensive trip. But he still had his papers, his phone, and
his reader, and his one prospective customer. It was everything he
needed to succeed, as long as he didn&rsquo;t give up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might have lost your briefcase,
Grandpa,&rdquo; he said aloud in English, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;m not going to lose the sale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A passing juvenile paused at the odd sound, then
continued on with the rest of the crowd.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Walker would never have believed he&rsquo;d be glad
to see anything on this planet, but his relief when he entered the
Spirit of Life Vegetarian Restaurant was palpable. The city&rsquo;s
tortuous streets had been made even more incomprehensible by the <i>Fthshpk</i>
crowds, and he had begun to doubt he would ever find it, or that it
would be open on the holiday. He had been going in entirely the wrong
direction when he had found the address by chance, on the pheromone-map
at a nearby intersection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long <i>Fthshpk?</i>&rdquo;
he asked the server, once he had eaten. It was the same server as
before, brown with white spine-tips; it stood behind the counter, hands
folded on its thorax, in a centered and imperturbable stance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day,&rdquo; it replied.
&ldquo;Though some believe the spirit of <i> Fthshpk</i>
should be felt in every heart all year long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walker suppressed a shudder at the thought.
&ldquo;Businesses open tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most of them, yes. Some trades take an
extended holiday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Building supplies?&rdquo;
Walker&rsquo;s anxiety made him sputter the word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will be open.&rdquo; The server
tilted its shoulders, a posture that seemed to convey amusement.
&ldquo;The most honored visitor is perhaps planning a construction
project?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He laughed weakly, a sound
that startled the server. &ldquo;Selling, not buying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The visitor is a most intriguing
creature.&rdquo; The server&rsquo;s shoulders returned to the
horizontal. &ldquo;This humble one wishes to help, but does not
know how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This one seeks business customers. The server
knows manufacturers? Inventory controllers? Enterprise resource
management specialists?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The guest&rsquo;s words are in the <i>Thfshpfth</i>
language, but alas, this one does not understand them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To apologize. Very specialized
business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The server lowered itself smoothly, bringing its face
down to Walker&rsquo;s level. Its gills moved like seaweed in a
gentle current. &ldquo;Business problems are not this
one&rsquo;s strength. Is the honored visitor having troubles with
family?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took Walker a moment to formulate his response.
&ldquo;No. Egg-parent, brood-parent deceased. This one no egglings.
Brood-partner . . . departed.&rdquo; For a moment he forgot who, or
what, he was talking to. &ldquo;This one spent too much time away
from nest. Brood-partner found another egg-partner.&rdquo; He fell
silent, lost in memory.</p>

<p>The server stood quietly for a moment, leaving Walker to
his thoughts. After a while it spoke: &ldquo;It is good to share
these stories. Undigested stories cause pain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanking you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This humble one is known as Shining Sky. If
the visitor wishes to share further stories, please return to this
establishment and request this one by name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Walker left the Spirit of Life, the sun had already
set. The <i>Fthshpk</i> crowds had thinned, with just a
few revelers still dancing and twirling under the yellow-green street
lights, so Walker was relatively unimpeded as he walked to hotel after
hotel. Alas, they all said, this humble one apologizes most profusely,
no room for the most honored visitor. Finally, exhausted, he found a
dark space between buildings. Wrapping his jacket around the carry-bag,
he placed it under his head&mdash;as a pillow, and for security. He
would grab a few hours&rsquo; sleep and meet with his customer the
first thing in the morning.</p>

<p>He slept soundly until dawn, when the first hot light of
day struck his face. He squinted and rolled over, then awoke fully at
the sensation of the hard alley floor under his head.</p>

<p>The bag was not there.</p>

<p>He sat up, wide-eyed, but his worst fears were
confirmed: his jacket and bag were nowhere to be seen. Panicked, he
felt at his waist&mdash;his passport and return ticket were safe.
But his money, his papers, his phone, and his reader were gone.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, human!&rdquo; said Amber Stone.
&ldquo;Once again the most excellent visitor graces this unworthy
establishment.&rdquo; It was late in the morning. Robbed of street
signs, addresses, and maps by the loss of his reader, Walker had
wandered the streets for hours in search of the factory. Without the
accustomed weight of his briefcase, he felt as though he might blow
away on the next breeze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You requested I come yesterday,&rdquo;
Walker hissed. &ldquo;I come, factory closed. Come again today.
Very important.&rdquo; Even without the papers from his briefcase,
he could still get a verbal commitment, or at least a strong expression
of interest . . . some tiny tidbit of achievement to prove to his
company, his father, his grandfather, and himself that he
wasn&rsquo;t a complete loss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely the superlative guest has more
important appointments than to meet with this insignificant
one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Amber Stone is most important
appointment. Urgent we discuss purchase of software.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This groveling one extends the most sincere
apologies for occupying the exalted guest&rsquo;s time, and will
not delay the most highly esteemed one any further.&rdquo; It
turned to leave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This-most-humble-one-begs-the-honored-one&rsquo;s-forgiveness!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amber Stone spoke without turning back. &ldquo;One
who appears at a merchant&rsquo;s establishment filthy, staggering,
and reeking of <i> Fthshpk</i>-rings is obviously one
whose concerns are so exalted as to be beyond the physical plane. Such
a one should not be distracted from its duties, which are surely
incomprehensible to mere mortals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walker&rsquo;s shoulders slumped in defeat, but then
it was as though he heard his father&rsquo;s voice in his inner
ear: <i>Ask for the sale</i>. Walker swallowed, then said
&ldquo;Would the honored Amber Stone accept indefinite loan of
inventory management system from this humble merchant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The alien paused at the threshold of its inner office,
then turned back to Walker. &ldquo;If that is what the most exalted
one desires, this simple manufacturer must surely pay heed. Would
fifty-three million be sufficient compensation for the loan of a
complete system?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stunned, Walker leaned against the wall. It was warm and
rounded, and throbbed slightly. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said at
last. &ldquo;Yes. Sufficient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where the hell have you been, Walker? Your
phone&rsquo;s been offline for days. And you look like
shit.&rdquo; Gleason, Walker&rsquo;s supervisor,
didn&rsquo;t look very good himself&mdash;his face on the
public phone&rsquo;s oval screen was discolored and distorted by
incompatibilities between the alien and human systems.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been busy.&rdquo; He
inserted Amber Stone&rsquo;s data-nodule into the phone&rsquo;s
receptor.</p>

<p>Gleason&rsquo;s eyes widened as the contract came up
on his display. &ldquo;Yes you have! This is great!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Gleason&rsquo;s
enthusiasm could not penetrate the shell of numbness around
Walker&rsquo;s soul. Whatever joy he might have felt at making the
sale had been drowned by three days of negotiations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This will make you the salesman of the
quarter! And the party&rsquo;s tomorrow night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The End-of-Quarter party. He thought of the bluff and
facile faces of his fellow salesmen, the loutish jokes and cheap
congratulations of every other EOQ he&rsquo;d ever attended. Would
it really be any different if his name was the one at the top of the
list? And then to return to his empty apartment, and go out the next
day to start a new quarter from zero. . . .</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Walker said, &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t make it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, what am I thinking?
It&rsquo;s gotta be at least a five day trip, with all the
transfers. Look, give me a call whenever you get in. You got my home
number?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in my phone.&rdquo;
Wherever that was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, well, I gotta go. See you
soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sat in the dim, stuffy little booth for a long time.
The greenish oval of the phone screen looked like a pool of stagnant
water, draining slowly away, reflecting the face of a man with no
family, no dog, no little house in the woods. And though he might be
the salesman of the quarter today, there were a lot of quarters between
here and retirement, and every one of them would be just as much work.</p>

<p>Eventually came the rap of chitinous knuckles on the
wall of the booth, and a voice. &ldquo;This most humble one begs
the worthy customer&rsquo;s forgiveness. Other customers desire to
use the phone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The booth cracked open like a seed pod. Walker stuck out
his head, blinking at the light, and the public phone attendant said
&ldquo;Ah, most excellent customer. This most unworthy one trusts
your call went well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Most well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The price of the call is two hundred
sixty-three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walker had about six in cash in his pants pockets. The
rest had vanished with his jacket. He thought a moment, then dug in his
money belt and pulled out a tiny plastic rectangle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ticket to Earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An interstellar transit ticket? To Earth?
Surely this humble one has misheard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Interstellar. To Earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is worth thousands!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Then, in English, he said
&ldquo;Keep the change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He left the attendant sputtering in incomprehension
behind him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The man was cursing the heat and the crowds as he pushed
through the restaurant&rsquo;s labia from the street, but when he
saw Walker he stopped dead and just gaped for a moment.
&ldquo;Jesus!&rdquo; he said at last, in English. &ldquo;I
thought I was the only human being on this Godforsaken
planet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walker was lean and very tan; his salt-and-pepper hair
and beard were long but neatly combed, and he stood with folded hands
in an attitude of centered harmony. He wore only a short white skirt.
&ldquo;Greetings,&rdquo; he said in the <i>Thfshpfth</i>
language, as he always did. &ldquo;This one welcomes the peaceful
visitor to the Spirit of Life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; The
English words were ludicrously loud and round.</p>

<p>Walker tapped his teeth together, making a sound like <i>
tk&rsquo;tk&rsquo;tk,</i> before he replied in English:
&ldquo;I am . . . serving food.&rdquo; The sound of it tickled
his mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On this planet, I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I live here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why did you come here? And why the Hell
did you stay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walker paused for a moment. &ldquo;I came to sell
something. It was an Earth thing. The people here didn&rsquo;t need
it. After a while I understood, and stopped trying. I&rsquo;ve been
much happier since.&rdquo; He gestured to one of the
squatting-posts. &ldquo;Please seat yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, uh . . . I think I&rsquo;ll
pass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure? The <i>thksh
hspthk</i> is very good today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, but no.&rdquo; The man turned to
go, but then he paused, pulled some money from his pocket, ran a reader
over it. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, handing it to Walker.
&ldquo;Good luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the restaurant&rsquo;s labia closed behind the
visitor, Walker touched the money, then smelled his fingertip. Three
hundred and eleven, a substantial sum.</p>

<p>He smiled, put the money in the donation jar, and
settled in to wait for the next customer. </p>
